<h2 class="p4"><a name="c1" id="c1">PUBLIC CHARITIES.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Modern</span> civilization has no higher
or more important question to deal
with than that of ameliorating the
condition of the poor, the unfortunate,
the ignorant, and the vicious.
Governments are and can be engaged
in no more appalling work than that
of legislating wisely in regard to these
classes, and in seeing that not only
are their inevitable wants provided
for and the public interests protected,
but also that their rights are secured
in fact as well as in theory, and that
the instruments employed in these
exalted spheres of public administration
are suited to their purpose,
and are guarded against degenerating
from means of amelioration into
agencies of oppression, cruelty, and
injustice.</p>

<p>There are two chief motives which
lead to the care and provision for the
unfortunate members of the social
body&mdash;charity on the one side, and
philanthropy on the other. Religion
inspires every motive for this great
and holy work, and of all the virtues
which religion inspires, charity is the
highest, purest, and best. Charity is
the love of God, and of man for God’s
sake. That God of charity has revealed
to us that, of faith, hope, and
charity, the greatest is charity; that he
that giveth to the poor lendeth to the
Lord; that he who performs works
of charity to the least of the human
race performs them <i>ipso facto</i> to the
Lord, creator and ruler of the universe;
and that the eternal doom of
every human being at the last dread
day will be decided by this great test.
Christianity itself, like her divine
founder, is charity. The church of
God, like her Lord and Spouse, is
charity. She is imbued with and reflects
his divine essence, which is
charity. Charity arises from no statute
or arbitrary decree, which might
or might not be made according to
the option of the legislator; it is the
essence and motive of all good. It
exists in the very nature of things.
And as the love of God by man is
the first and necessary relation of the
creature to the Creator, and as our
fellow-creatures exist from God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in and by him, it is only through God
and in him that we love them. Thus
charity is no human sentiment or affection,
like philanthropy or the natural
love of our neighbor and brother;
it is a supernatural virtue, springing
from God, and sustained by his grace.
The man who does not love his neighbor
cannot love God, but rejects his
love and violates the first law of his
being. Every word and act of our
divine Saviour, while engaged on earth
in establishing his church, proves this,
if there be need of external proof.
Even after his work on earth was
done, and he had ascended to his
Father, he speaks to us through the
mouth of S. Paul: “If I speak with
the tongues of men and angels, and
have not charity, I am become as
sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.
And if I have prophecy, and know
all mysteries, and all knowledge, and
have all faith, so I could remove
mountains, and have not charity, I
am nothing. And if I should distribute
all my goods to feed the poor,
and should give my body to be
burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
me nothing.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Philanthropy, on the other hand,
is the love of man for the sake of
man; in other words, humanitarianism.
It is a human affection springing
from natural motives. To alleviate
human sufferings, and promote
human pleasures and enjoyments, are
its aims. Its object is the body rather
than the soul, earth rather than
heaven, time rather than eternity.
Its motive power is sentiment or feeling
rather than reason or religion. It
is a sensitiveness to all human suffering,
because suffering or pain is repulsive
to human nature. Philanthropy
is a virtue in the natural order,
springing from human motives, and
not a supernatural virtue springing
from religious motives and inspired
by divine grace. Philanthropy is
good in itself, for our human nature
still remains; nature and grace are
not antagonistic, and may co-exist;
nature is dependent on grace to raise
it to the supernatural state and transform
it into charity. Charity includes
philanthropy, as the greater includes
the lesser. Philanthropy without
charity is earthly in its aims, frequently
rash and sometimes unjust in
its measures, tyrannical in the exercise
of power, and not unfrequently
barren in its results.</p>

<p>Now, the church and the state are
the organized representatives of these
two virtues, the divine and the human.
The church is a divine kingdom, and
cultivates the divine virtue of charity;
the state is a human kingdom, and
cultivates the human virtue of philanthropy.
The church is a supernatural
body, and practises the supernatural
virtue of charity; the state
exists in the natural order, and practises
the natural sentiment of philanthropy.
The church is of heaven,
and her greatest jewel, charity, is of
heaven; the state is of earth, and the
greatest of her merits is philanthropy,
which is of earthly birth. The church
is eternal, so is charity; the state is
temporal, as is philanthropy. The
church is of God, God is charity, so
the church is charity; the state is of
man, so is philanthropy. The rewards
of the one are eternal; of the
other, temporal. Charity is a Christian
virtue, and can violate no other
Christian virtue in adopting her measures;
she cannot make the end justify
the means; but philanthropy is a
human virtue, and stops at no means
necessary to attain its end. Abuses
are not necessarily the results of
philanthropy, for philanthropy, guided
by even human reason, is capable
of respecting the rights of
God and men, and, when guided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
by supernatural grace, is exalted to
charity.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>What we have chiefly to deal with
in this article are institutions of benevolence,
which are either wholly
public property, and such as, though
conducted either by private individuals
or by incorporated boards of
citizen managers, yet receive large
shares of the public funds for their
foundation, buildings, or current support,
and thus become, to that extent,
public institutions, and as such liable
to be inquired into and criticised by
the state and its citizens who pay the
taxes thus expended.</p>

<p>The state in our times and in almost
every country undertakes the
restraint and custody of the persons
of idiots, lunatics, drunkards, and
other persons of unsound mind, for
their safety; of paupers, for their
maintenance; and of minors, unprovided
with natural guardians, for
purposes of their education, reformation,
and maintenance. It is not for
us to discuss at length in this article
the right of the state in any country
to <i>educate and reform</i> minors, or, in
other words, to assume the place of
teacher and priest; for it cannot undertake
to educate without assuming
the place of teacher, and still less
can the state undertake the work of
reformation without usurping the sacred
functions of the sacerdotal office.
Our faith, our reason, and our
convictions teach us that such offices
belong not to the state, but to the
church. The state can establish
places of restraint and punishment,
and support and maintain them,
both for the protection of the public,
for the safety of the individuals themselves,
and for purposes of philanthropy.
Having done this, it is the
duty of the state to leave free the
consciences of its wards and prisoners,
and to give every facility to the
ministers of every church and religious
persuasion to have free and unrestricted
access to the children and
prisoners belonging to those respective
churches or persuasions. We
claim this for ourselves as Catholics,
and we leave the sects, the Jews, and
every other society of religionists to
claim the same for themselves. We
are willing to make common cause
with them for the attainment of our
rights. That it is a charity for the
state, or, more correctly speaking, a
work of humanity, to assume the
temporal care and provision for those
unfortunate members of society who,
either by their own fault, by the visitation
of Providence, or by misfortune,
are unable to take care of
themselves, we are not disposed to
deny at present, though even this belongs
primarily to the religious duties
of the individual, and, therefore,
comes within the province of the
church; and we know how well the
church discharged this duty before
the Reformation, and is doing it
now. Yet we do not deny to the
sects, to all men, and to the state,
the right to perform good deeds and
to practise the broadest philanthropy.
Such at least seems to be one
of the accepted works of government.
We therefore accept such
institutions and works as we find
them, and we will view them in
the same light in which our fellow-citizens
generally regard them. As
citizens, as Americans, we feel the
same interest in them, experience the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
same pride in them, and, as a question
of property and public right, we
hold them as a common heritage, in
which we have the same interest and
authority as our fellow-citizens. We
are, therefore, equally interested in
their proper management and good
government, and we yield to none in
our desire to promote their prosperity
and success. There is no part of
public administration more sacred or
important, no function of the state so
momentous, no public responsibility
so awful, as this. Accepting them, as
we do, as a part of our common
property and united work, we shrink
not from any effort for their good
government and success, and, if need
be, for their improvement, reformation,
and correction. When properly
conducted, we have nothing but
praise for them; and if, on the other
hand, they are mismanaged, the
funds extravagantly applied; if they
are made the instruments of cruelty,
perversion, or despotism; if in them
or any of them religious liberty is
violated, and systems of proselytizing
are carried on against Catholic children,
or the children of the sects, or
those of the Jewish Church, we as
Catholics and as American citizens
will speak out freely and boldly in
denouncing them. We are not disqualified
from doing this, either as
citizens or Catholics; not as citizens,
because they belong to us as much
as to other citizens; our money is
there with that of others; and the
Constitution gives us liberty of
speech and of the press, and guarantees
to us “the right to assemble
and petition for the redress of grievances”;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
not as Catholics, for we
have as such the experience of eighteen
hundred years of the most exalted
works of charity; and because
we claim for ourselves no special
privilege over others, but are willing
to concede to all what we claim for
ourselves. No clamor will deter
us from the exercise of this right, or
from the performance of this duty.
And whilst we cannot yield our
rights to any one sect of Protestantism,
we are equally determined,
while respecting the rights of all
Protestants, not to yield our constitutional
rights to all the sects of Protestantism
combined under the false
and deceptive name of unsectarianism.
We do not believe in <i>ex-parte</i>
and sham investigations of public
abuses in respect to public institutions,
and we do not belong to, and
are determined not to be deluded by,
whitewashing committees of investigation
and amiable grand juries.
We are ever ready to praise, yet we
shrink not from administering censure.</p>

<p>The theory upon which governmental
institutions are founded, and
those established by private citizens
or boards are assisted is, that of protecting
society from a large, idle, ignorant,
vicious population, by providing
the means for the temporal
relief and social improvement and
correction of these classes, so as to
bring them to the age of self-support
in the case of children, to punish
criminals, relieve the poor, and thus
gradually return them all to society
as sober, enlightened, honest, industrious,
and thrifty citizens. For these
purposes heavy taxes are laid on the
citizens, immense piles of buildings
are erected at the public expense,
and such institutions are annually
maintained or aided at enormous
cost to the people. In our November,
1872, number, while admitting
and praising the philanthropic motive
which sustains these institutions, we
regarded them “as really nuisances
of the worst kind, so far as Catholic
children are concerned, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of their proselytizing character.
Moreover,” we said, “in their actual
workings they violate the rights both
of parents and children, and we have
evidence that these poor children are
actually sold at the West, both by
private sale and by auction. The
horrible abuses existing in some state
institutions are partly known to the
public, and we have the means of
disclosing even worse things than
those which have recently been exposed
in the public papers.” It is
difficult to perceive the success of
such institutions as ameliorating or
reformatory agents, for our public
press is loaded every day with evidences
of the enormous increase of
crime and pauperism, and with dissertations
on the causes of such increase.
The public are naturally
slow in believing that such institutions,
upon which so much treasure
has been spent, are failures. Such a
reflection is an unpalatable one; it is
humiliating to our pride, and damaging
to the boasted progress of the
XIXth century. It crushes our self-esteem
to know that, of all places
needing correction, our Houses of
Correction need correction most; and
that, of all institutions calling for the
stern hand of reform, there are none
that need so much reformation as
our schools of reform. A religious
paper called <i>The Christian Union</i>
has given strong proof of its dislike
to have the public eyes opened to
these unpalatable truths, and we do
not think we should have returned
so soon to this subject but for a rather
disingenuous article in that
paper, couched in terms not calculated
to convince the public that it derived
its name from the practice or
spirit of the virtue of Christian union,
which, while challenging us to expose
these wrongs and abuses, declared
but too great a willingness to believe
“that these charges, so frequently
made in Roman Catholic journals,
have already received thorough investigation
and perfect refutation.”</p>

<p>We complain that our Catholic
children in institutions which are
supported in whole or in part by public
funds&mdash;funds, therefore, in which
we have a common property with
our fellow-citizens&mdash;instead of being
allowed the instruction and practice
of their Catholic religion, are taught
Protestantism in its, to us, most offensive
form, and are thus exposed to the
almost certain loss of their faith. The
facts upon which we base the charge
have never been denied, but, on the
contrary, they are openly admitted and
announced. Protestants deny that
they proselytize Catholic children so
as to make them members of any
distinctive sect, but they admit that
Catholic teaching and practices are
rigidly excluded, and yet that the
children are taught a certain religion.
Is it not evident that, if such religious
instruction produces any result, it is
to make these children cease to be
Catholics, to become non-Catholics,
to take the Bible as their only rule
of faith, to reject the infallible teachings
of their own church, and to accept
the teachings of the institutions
as all that is necessary for them to
know? This is proselytism of the
most offensive kind; our children are
either made <i>liberal Christians</i>, or are
placed in circumstances which inevitably
lead to their joining one or
other of the distinctive forms of Protestantism
or lose all religion whatever.
Wherever a chaplain is employed,
he is either a Methodist
minister, such as Rev. Mr. Pierce in
the New York House of Refuge, or
he is a Baptist, Episcopalian, or
other sectarian minister. In many
of these institutions, the religious instruction
is under the direction of a
lay superintendent, as in the Providence
School of Reform. And here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
we beg to give a piece of testimony
showing how incompetent laymen are
for religious instruction in public reformatories.
The witness under examination
was at the time one of the
trustees of the Providence Reform
School:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Q. Have you any knowledge in relation
to the distribution of religious books
among the pupils, and their being taken
away?</p>

<p>“A. I don’t of my own knowledge; I
furnished once one book of a religious
character, and one only; I furnished it to
the <i>officer having in charge the devotional
exercises</i> on the girls’ side; I gave that to
the officer for his own use; it was given
to him in consequence of considerable
religious feeling that there was existing
among the girls at the time; the girls
were holding among themselves what
they called prayer-meetings; the <i>gentleman
having in charge the devotional exercises
said he felt utterly incompetent to conduct
the devotions in suitable words</i>,” etc.</p></div>

<p class="p1">Religious liberty is openly and
positively denied in the New York
House of Refuge, as will be seen
from their own “Report of Special
Committee to the Managers of the
House of Refuge,” 1872; from
which it appears, at pp. 21, 22, that
the religion of the house consists in
“Christian worship in simple form,
and Gospel lessons in Sunday-schools,”
and that the “inmates are
brought into the <i>same</i> chapel for public
worship,” and that “the whole
regimen of the house,” including of
course the religious part, “is devised
and pursued with careful attention to
the <i>wants of the inmates, but is not
submitted to the control of themselves
or their friends</i>.” As Americans we
have been taught from our infancy
that liberty of conscience is the dearest
right of the American citizen.
We learned in our college days that
even “Congress shall make no law
respecting the establishment of a religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof”; but we now learn that
what the highest legislative power in
the nation, and what no state legislature,
can do, the managers of the
New York House of Refuge have
done and are now doing: they
have made a law respecting the establishment
of a religion in the
House of Refuge, a public institution&mdash;a
religion which they have called
variously “Christian worship in simple
form,” “Gospel lessons,” “Unsectarianism,”
“The Broad Principles of
Christianity”&mdash;and have forbidden the
free exercise of any other religion.
Even if all Christians were united in
this worship and in these principles,
have Jewish citizens no rights under
the Constitution? As citizens of the
State of New York, we have learned
from the state constitution and Bill
of Rights “that the free exercise and
practice of religious profession and
worship without discrimination or
preference shall <i>for ever be allowed to
all mankind</i>.” Chancellor Kent, in
his <i>Commentaries on American Law</i>,
says that “<i>the free exercise</i> and enjoyment
of religious profession and
worship may be considered as one
of the <i>absolute rights of individuals</i>,
recognized in our American constitutions
and secured to them by
law.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And Story, in his <i>Commentaries
on the Constitution</i>, maintains in
equally strong terms “the freedom
of public worship according to the
dictates of one’s conscience.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But we are now told by the Managers
of the House of Refuge that “delinquency
has, under the law, worked
some forfeiture of rights, and that
neither the delinquents nor their
friends for them can justly claim,
while under sentence of the courts,
equal freedom with the rest of
the community who have not
violated the law.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Such was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
answer given by American citizens,
constituting the Board of Managers
of the New York House of Refuge,
to the committee of American citizens
sent by the Catholic Union to
demand liberty of conscience and
freedom of religious worship for the
Catholic children in the Refuge!
Either this answer means that the
children in the House of Refuge are
not a portion of <i>mankind</i>, or that religious
freedom is one of the rights
forfeited by delinquency, or the
Board of Managers have proclaimed
themselves guilty of the grossest violation
of the rights of man and of
God. We presume these gentlemen
will not admit either the first or the
third of these alternatives; indeed,
they almost say in terms that a commitment
to the House of Refuge
works a forfeiture of that religious liberty
guaranteed to all mankind. We
know delinquency under the law suspends
the civil rights of the delinquent
while in prison, such as the
right to hold public office or administer
a private trust; but it does not
work even a forfeiture of property
except in the case of an outlawry
of treason. These are all the forfeitures
worked by the highest crimes
known to the law. Religion is not
a civil right; no crime can forfeit it;
no power on earth can extinguish it.
The greatest of public malefactors,
the murderer and the traitor, enjoy
it even on the scaffold: does the
child whose only offence is poverty
or vagrancy forfeit it? In the sacred
names of Liberty and Religion,
what sort of <i>Refuge</i> is this to stand
on American soil?</p>

<p>The Children’s Aid Society is another
New York institution largely
supported by public funds. We learn
from its Nineteenth Annual Report,
1871, that one of its objects is to shelter
in its lodging-houses the orphan
and the homeless girls and boys, and
labor incessantly to give them the
“<i>foundation ideas of morals and religion</i>”
(p. 5). Alluding to the <i>Italian</i>
School, No. 44 Franklin Street, the
report says: “We have <i>conquered the
prejudices and superstition of ignorance</i>,
and <i>converted</i> into useful citizens hundreds
of this unfortunate class.” With
such a programme of unsectarian
conversion, the leading feature in
which is indifferentism in religion,
the immediate forerunner of infidelity
and agrarianism, it is no wonder that
the report immediately proceeds:
“So much so, indeed, that the Italian
government,” that same godless government
which is so ferociously waging
war on Catholicity, “has taken a
deep interest in our institution” (p.
28).</p>

<p>It is only necessary to read these
reports to be convinced that the system
either leads to materialism, the
religion of worldly prosperity and
thrifty citizenship, or to some form of
Protestant sectarianism. The system
of “emigration” pursued by such
institutions, by which children are
sent out West and placed with anybody
and everybody who will take
them, completes the work commenced
in the East. On pages 54-56 of
the report last quoted is related
the case of a youth sent East,
who “cannot speak of his parents with
any certainty at all”; it matters not
what religion they were of, the son is
now <i>preparing for the ministry</i> of one
of the sects. His letter also recites
a similar case in reference to another
boy “who was sent out West.” It
is certain that he is not preparing for
the Catholic ministry, for his impressions
of a miracle are thus expressed:
“To be taken from the gutters of
New York City and placed in a college
is almost a miracle.” The story
of young “Patrick,” p. 59, whose
education was obtained at the Preparatory
School at Oberlin and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Cornell University, is significant. On
page 60 is told the story of an <i>Irish</i>
orphan girl sent to Connecticut, and
placed with “an intelligent Christian
woman, who means to do right.” On
page 63 is told the history of a little
boy sent to Michigan, who is well
pleased with toys and new clothes,
“like all other children; he has a
splendid new suit of clothes just got,
and <i>he attends church and Sabbath-school</i>.”
A similar case is related at
page 65, of a little girl sent to Ohio,
and we shall show below what has
become of little girls sent to that
state. These are some of the model
cases of which this unsectarian society
makes a boast in its report. It is
a significant fact that, of the 8,835
who came under the influences of this
society in one year, 3,312 were of
Irish birth, and it may be estimated
with certainty that a considerable
proportion of the other children of
foreign, as well as many of home
birth were Catholics. The number
of children born in Ireland who were
sent West during the year was 1,058.
This institution received for the furtherance
of these unsectarian objects
the sum of $66,922.70 in this year
from our public funds.</p>

<p>We have also before us the Twentieth
Annual Report of the New York
Juvenile Asylum, 1871, which proves
the proselytizing character of this public-pap-fed
unsectarian institution.
“The children that are entrusted to
us are at the <i>most susceptible period of
life</i>,” etc., “when their destiny for
time, if not <i>for eternity</i>, may be fixed”
(p. 9). “They must be drilled into
systematic habits of life in eating,
sleeping, play, study, work, and <i>worship</i>”
(p. 10). To “attend church”
(p. 21), and “the evening worship,”
and religious services generally, are
frequently recurring duties of the children.
In this institution the children
of foreign birth during the year were
3,648, and of these 1,981 were born
in Ireland. Of course we cannot say
how many of the children of home
birth were the children of Irish and
Catholic parents. We have, alas! but
too much certainty that a large proportion
of the children are Catholic.
We casually met recently with an interesting
proof of this in <i>Scribner’s
Magazine</i>, November, 1870, in an account
given by a visitor to the Juvenile
Asylum. In the evening the visitor
was invited to see the girls’ dormitory
as the girls were going to bed.
She writes: “All the children were
saying their prayers. I noticed that
several of them made the sign of the
cross as they rose.” Touching evidence
of their traditional faith and
parental teaching! a simple but sublime
tribute to holy church! an earnest
sign of love and hope for those
sacraments which came to us through
the cross, but which, like that cross
itself, were not a part of the religion,
worship, and practice of this unsectarian
asylum.</p>

<p>In the list of model examples presented
in the report of the Western
agent will be seen the usual proselytizing
influence of such institutions. The
cases either show mere material or
worldly advantage, or the embrace of
pure sectarianism. On page 50 is related
the case of a little girl, who
“scarcely remembers her parents,”
of whom it is related that “she is a
member of the Presbyterian Church.”
Two other girls are indentured to
members of the Methodist Episcopal
Church. The “church and Sunday-school”
are prominent features in
nearly every case. The amount received
during the year by this <i>unsectarian</i>
institution from our public funds
was $62,065.24..</p>

<p>The Five Points House of Industry,
which received, from 1858 to
1869, the sum of $30,731.69. from
our Board of Education, states in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
its charter, among the objects for
which it was incorporated, the following:
“III. To imbue the objects
of its care with the pure principles of
Christianity, as revealed in the Holy
Scriptures, without bias from the
distinctive peculiarities of any individual
sect.” This means that the
children belonging to distinctive religious
denominations, instead of
being allowed to follow the distinctive
tenets, and practise the worship,
in which they were reared, are deprived
of this right, and, as respects
the Catholic children, they are to reject
and exclude every tenet and devotion
distinctively Catholic. How
far even this profession of unsectarianism
is carried into practice will
be discovered from the <i>Monthly
Record</i> of the Five Points House of
Industry for April and May, 1870,
p. 302, giving an account of the dedicatory
exercises:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>“The services consisted of an opening
anthem by the children, followed by a
prayer by <i>Rev.</i> Dr. Paxton, asking a blessing
upon the House and its objects.</p>

<p>“This was followed by a hymn; a
statement of the affairs of the institution,
by <i>Rev.</i> S. B. Halliday; a recitative by
the children; a statement as to city missions,
by <i>Rev.</i> G. J. Mingins; a short discourse
on the ‘Union of Christian Effort,’
by <i>Rev.</i> H. D. Ganse; a discourse on the
‘Lights and Shadows of Large Cities,’ by
<i>Rev.</i> John Hall, D.D.; and, finally, a
roundelay given by the children.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">How far the pledge given in the
charter of this establishment, “without
<i>bias</i> from the distinctive peculiarities
of any individual sect,” is carried
out is further seen from the following
extract from a letter addressed by the
president to the Rev. John Cotton
Smith, a prominent minister of the
Episcopalian sect: “Between your
church and the institution the most
kind and harmonious <i>co-operation</i> has
ever existed. They will ever cherish
a most pleasing remembrance of the
relations that have subsisted between
them.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>We might have alluded to the
“Howard Mission and Home for
Little Wanderers,” founded by that
arch-proselytizer, the Rev. W. C.
Van Meter, which during seven years
<i>disposed of</i> 7,580 “little wanderers”
of this city, in an unsectarian manner;
but want of space forbids our
doing so. But the <i>animus</i> pervading
this and other unsectarian institutions
is exhibited to us now in the
fact, that this reverend has transferred
the field of his labors from the
Five Points to the city of Rome, the
centre and headquarters of Catholicity.
He has there established a
mission and home for the little Romans.
We do not stand alone in our
opinion that such institutions are
nuisances for Catholic children, and
we quote the closing words of a letter
recently addressed to the Rev.
Mr. Van Meter by the editor of the
<i>Voce della Verita</i>, at Rome:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Now, dear sir, excuse me if I remind
you, that although a very ignorant person,
‘when I was a little boy,’ I also went to
school, and learned a few things about
your country. I remember to have heard
it said that misery and ignorance abounded
there, and that many hundreds of
thousands of your compatriots knew of
no other God than the almighty dollar.
Why do you not go back and teach in
Nebraska or Texas, and leave us alone?
You might positively do some good
there&mdash;now you are a&mdash;well, let me tell
the truth&mdash;a <i>nuisance</i>. By your homeward
voyage, you will benefit both your
own country and ours.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Another complaint that we make
against our semi-governmental charities
relates to the violation of the
rights of parents and children, in the
sale of these children at the West.
This pernicious practice of exiling
and transporting children from New
York to the West is still in full vigor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
amongst these institutions. How
can we boast of our charities, when
their main feature consists in shifting
the burden from our own shoulders
to those of others, and they are
strangers? It is in vain that we
claim these children as the wards and
<i>protégés</i> of society and of our city,
if we repudiate the duties and responsibilities
of our guardianship.
Against this cruelty and injustice we
protest in the names of civilization
and Christianity. The institutions
whose reports we have referred to
not only admit, but they boast of
this outrage upon the rights of parents
and of children. One of them,
the Children’s Aid Society, refers to
this branch of operations, “its Emigration
System,” as the “crown” of
all its works. The number of children
thus exiled from the state by
this society and transported to distant
regions, during the year of the
report referred to, was 3,386; the
whole number since 1854 was 25,215.
More than half the 3,386 were sent
to Ohio, and to the distant states of
Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Kansas, and Nebraska. Of one little
boy thus exiled, who was separated
from his parents at the age of eight
years, the Western agent reports: “I
think his mother would scarcely know
him.” He reports that the mistress
to whom another was “disposed of”
writes of him: “Indeed, I don’t know
what I should do without him, for
he saves me a great many steps. I
wish we could find out about his
brother and sister, he often cries
about them.”</p>

<p>Exile and transportation of children
is also practised by the Five
Points House of Industry. They
have obtained extraordinary powers
for this purpose from the Legislature.
For while the Commissioners of Public
Charities and Correction, a purely
governmental institution, possess
the power of indenturing children to
citizens of the state of New York and
adjoining states only, the Five Points
House of Industry has received the
power to send them anywhere and
everywhere. But the Commissioners
of Public Charities and Correction
send the poor children they get into
their power to the most remote states
in violation of the express law of the
case. For instead of confining
their indentures to citizens of New
York and the adjoining states, as the
law directs, they send them indiscriminately
to every state, even the
most distant. We ask those public
servants by what fiction of law they
make California and Texas <i>adjoin</i>
New York?</p>

<p>The New York Juvenile Asylum
has also a “regular agency at Chicago,
by which the work of indenturing
children at the West is conducted.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The total number of children
sent West during fifteen years, from
1857 to 1871 inclusive, is 2,206, and
the annual average, 147-1/15 (p. 47).</p>

<p>The extent to which this <i>crowning</i>
cruelty of our non-sectarian institutions
is carried, is appalling. We
have only cited the cases of the
three whose reports happened to be
before us. But we have been informed,
unofficially, and we think the
statement can be made good, that
there are in the city of New York no
less than twenty-eight <i>charitable</i> institutions
engaged in this cruel practice
of transporting our New York children
to the West and other remote
parts, and the average number of
these little exiles per week is about
two hundred, making about ten thousand
every year. What untold
abuses and hardships must result from
this barbarous practice! However
noble, generous, and philanthropic
may be the motives of the citizen-managers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of these institutions, they
cannot attend in person to the details
or even the general management of
their work. Not only are their
houses in the city confided to the
management of hired and salaried
agents and servants, but the work of
transporting children to the West is
confided generally to the same class
of agents, and we intend to show
how this <i>charitable</i> function is discharged.
They are actuated by no
higher motives than usually actuate
their class. The love of God, and
of man for God’s sake, is not the
spirit that inspires their labors and
guides their steps. Corruption and
infidelity to duty have stalked brazenly
into the public service everywhere;
what reason have we for
claiming an exemption in favor of
those who find profitable employment
in the administration of public
charities?</p>

<p>But, as the <i>Christian Union</i> demands
further proof than is accessible
to the public, we will produce some
additional evidence, although we
think we have already shown enough
to condemn this system; and the tone
of that journal’s article leads us to
believe that if an angel from heaven
disclosed to its view the same corruption
and oppression which we see in
this branch of public administration,
it would still cling to its idols.</p>

<p>Now we have before us a letter,
dated September 23, 1872, addressed
by a clergyman at Tiffin,
Ohio, to a clergyman in the East,
from which we quote:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In answer to your request concerning
those children brought on some four or
five years ago from the East to be disposed
of, I might say with prudence, that
to several counties of Ohio had been
brought car-loads of children from three
years on to twelve and thirteen years old,
and offered to the <i>public</i> to take one or
more; for they who offered the children
said those who would take them had to
pay the expenses of bringing them to the
place. For some children the man said
the expense would be fifteen dollars, for
others more, others less. This is the way
the affair was carried on for some time.”</p>

<p class="p1">The gentleman to whom the foregoing
letter was addressed, and who
sent it to us, gives also his own testimony
on this public traffic in innocent
human beings. His letter is
dated September 25, 1872, and reads
as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“At that time,” some four or five years
ago, “I was on a trip to Tiffin. Delayed
for a short time at Clyde, I asked some
questions of the baggage-master. Three
little girls were near him, and I asked
him: ‘Are these your daughters?’ A.
‘No, I bought them?’ ‘Bought them!
how? from whom?’ A. ‘Oh! from the
ministers. They bring car-loads of these
little ones every few weeks, and sell them
to any one who wants them. I gave $10
for this one, $12 for the next, and $15
for the oldest. I had not the money, but
I borrowed it from the tavern-keeper, and
paid for the girls. Lately there was another
load of them. There was a very fine
girl. I wanted her. But the minister
said, ‘No; I have promised her to a rich
man in Forrest, who will pay more than
you.’ After some further conversation of
a similar character, the train came in
sight, and I left. The next day I was
speaking of the circumstance at table.
Rev. Mr.&mdash;&mdash; remarked that he knew the
baggage-master well, and that what he
said was true. He added, ‘Within the
last month there was a sale of some thirty
of these children in our Court House.
One of my parishioners, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, came
along as the sale was about over. A little
boy was standing before the Court
House crying; the German asked him,
‘What is the matter?’ He said, ‘That man
wants to sell me, and no one will buy
me.’ The boy was bought by the German
for $10. I had heard such transactions
described in one of his lectures by F.
Haskins. But I scarcely realized how
fearful such conduct is until I heard a
description of these sales from persons
who had seen them.”</p>

<p class="p1">Such, indeed, is the “crowning”
work of some of the charitable institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of New York! Is this the
fulfilment of the Gospel of charity,
or of the Sermon on the Mount, or
of the broad principles of Christianity?
Perhaps, rather, it is the Rev.
Mr. Pierce’s <i>elastic</i> system of religion.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Compare these humiliating
facts with the self-congratulatory reports
on “Emigration” of the Children’s
Aid Society, which in 1871
sent three hundred and seven of
these little wards of the city to the
same state of Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> At page 10
we read:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Every year we expect that the opposition
of a very bigoted and ignorant class
will materially lessen this <i>the most effective
of our charitable efforts</i>. We have surpassed,
however, owing to the energy of
our Western agents, the results of every
previous equal period, in the labors of the
past year.</p>

<p>“Crowds of poor boys have thronged
the office or have come to the lodging-houses
for a ‘chance to go West’; great
numbers of very destitute but honest
families have appealed to us for this aid,
and our agents have frequently conveyed
parties of a hundred and more. The
West has received these children <i>liberally</i>
as before; and there has been less complaint
the past year than usual of bad
habits and perverse tempers. The larger
boys are still restless as ever, and inclined
to change their places where higher inducements
are offered. But this characteristic
they have in common with our
whole laboring class.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Again:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Emigration.&mdash;This department has
worked most successfully the past year.
A larger number has been removed from
the city than ever before.”</p>

<p class="p1">It would seem, however, that the
experience of the New York Juvenile
Asylum, though still persevering
in this traffic as a good work, has
not been as satisfactory as that of the
Children’s Aid Society. We will
give an extract from the Twentieth
Annual Report, showing even from
the mouths of those who practise it
as a good work what a crying evil
this is, and confirming the extracts
we have given in reference to the
sales of children in Ohio:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Removing and replacing children is
one of the important functions of the agency.
Our children are first placed on trial,
and in nearly every company some have
to be replaced over and over again before
they are permanently settled. But even
after indentures have been executed, new
<i>developments</i> often compel removals. Such
are the weaknesses of human nature, and
such the instability of human affairs, that,
without provision to meet the exigencies
consequent upon them, <i>cases of extreme
hardship and inhumanity would be frequent</i>.
They who have not had experience
in this kind of work are not apt to
realize, and it is often difficult to persuade
them of, <i>the imperative need of such
provision</i>. <i>Children will not unfrequently
get into improper hands in spite of every
precaution, and in many cases success is
more or less problematical.</i> Death of employers
also, and change of circumstances,
are often the occasion of removals. <i>Not
a month goes by that does not furnish cases
where, but for timely attention, suffering,
mischief, and irreparable evil would result.</i>
A little familiarity with the field work of
this agency would convince its most obdurate
opponent that <i>to leave children
without recourse among strangers in a
strange land is an unjustifiable procedure</i>.”</p>

<p class="p1">Apart from the inhumanity of this
procedure, from its unchristian
character, from its proselytizing effects,
we protest against it in the
name of law, of right, and of human
liberty. The common law of England
is our heritage, and by that common
law “no power on earth, except
the authority of parliament, can send
any subject of England out of the
land against his will; no, not even a
criminal. The great charter declares
that no freeman shall be banished
unless by the judgment of his peers
or by the law of the land; and by
the <i>habeas corpus</i> act it is enacted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that no subject of this realm who is
an inhabitant of England, Wales, or
Berwick shall be sent into Scotland,
Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or other
places beyond the seas.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Chancellor
Kent, in his <i>Commentaries on American
Law</i> (ii. 34), claims the same proud
privilege as one of the absolute rights
of American citizens, and, while declaring
that “no citizen can be sent
abroad,” states that the constitutions
of several of the states of our confederacy
contain express provisions forbidding
transportation beyond the
state.</p>

<p>We come now to the last and not
the least painful task, which the
<i>Christian Union</i> insists upon our undertaking;
it relates to “the horrible
abuses existing in some of our state
institutions.” And here, as in the
preceding remarks, we must confine
ourselves to a portion only of the mass
of materials before us, and, in fact,
confine ourselves to a single institution;
for, if such things exist in a single
case, this is enough to prove not only
the possibility, but also the probability
of the same thing in others, and
to dispel the fatal blindness which
can see nothing defective either in
their constitution or management.
We must pass over the charges recently
preferred against the New
York House of Refuge, relating to
improper food, of excessive labor, of
cruel punishments, employment of unfit
and incompetent agents in the management
of the institution, and of religious
intolerance. While we think that
the evidence produced on the trial of
the boy, Justus Dunn, for killing one of
the officers of the Refuge, goes far to
substantiate most of the charges preferred,
we have, in common with the
community, but little respect for the
whitewashing certificate given by the
grand-jury, who made a flying visit
to the institution, by invitation, on an
appointed day. Of course the officers
put their house in order, and failed
not to put their best foot foremost,
on this preconcerted occasion. The
managers placed no reliance on this
acquittal, for they courted another
soon afterwards. The second investigation
by the State Commissioners
of Charity was very little better; it
was <i>ex parte</i> on all the charges except
that of religious intolerance, and
the Refuge was acquitted on all the
charges except this last.</p>

<p>We must also pass over, for want
of space, the revolting case which
occurred at the New York Juvenile
Asylum in June last, in which one of
the inmates of the asylum, a colored
girl, instead of finding there an asylum
from temptation and seduction,
fell a victim to the lust of one of the
officers of the institution, who fled
precipitately on discovery of the fact.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
We must pass over, for the same reason,
the investigations recently conducted
at St. Louis, which are far
from showing a satisfactory result for
the management and conduct of public
reformatories. We must confine
ourselves now to a single institution&mdash;a
case in which the evidence is replete
with horrible abuses, cruelties, improprieties,
and wrongs. While we
would be sorry to apply the maxim,
<i>ex uno disce omnes</i>, we can but regard
this case as a general warning to our
people to beware of regarding as
good everything in the moral order
that goes under the much-abused
name of <i>reform</i>.</p>

<p>The Providence School of Reform
is an institution supported by funds
received both from the state of
Rhode Island and from the city of
Providence. Its object seems to be
the temporal, social, and moral reformation
of juvenile delinquents of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
both sexes. Some time prior to 1869,
it had been the subject of the gravest
charges and investigation, which tended
to show that, so far from having
been in all its departments and workings
a school of reform, it had in some
instances become a school for vice
and immorality. The whitewashing
process, that facile and amiable way
of avoiding disagreeable complications,
prevented the accomplishment
of any change for the better. But in
1869 the charges against the institution
took a more definite form, and
were signed and presented by thirty-one
citizens of Providence to the corporate
authorities&mdash;citizens of the first
respectability and standing. The
Board of Aldermen of the city of
Providence, headed by the Mayor,
undertook the investigation, and the
evidence is contained in two large
volumes in one, extending over
eleven hundred and forty-two pages.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The charges were the most serious
ones that could be brought against
an institution, especially against one
professing <i>reform</i>, and had their origin
with citizens without distinction
of creed. Their true character and
extent can only be understood by a
perusal of them:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“First. That vices against chastity, decency,
and good morals have prevailed in
the school, and have been taught and
practised by teachers as well as by pupils;
that these vices have existed both in the
male and female departments, and that
the children usually leave the school
more corrupt than when they entered it.</p>

<p>“Second. That teachers have used
immodest and disgusting language in
the presence of children, and have addressed
females in an indecent manner
by referring to their past character, and
by calling them vile and unbecoming
names.</p>

<p>“Third. That modes of punishment the
most cruel and inhuman have been used
in said school, such as knocking down
and kicking the pupils, and whipping
them when naked, and with a severity
not deserved by their offences.</p>

<p>“Fourth. That young women are said
to have been kicked, knocked down,
dragged about by the hair of the head,
and otherwise brutally treated, but more especially
that all modesty and decency have
been outraged by stripping them to the
waist and lashing them on the naked back;
taking them from their beds and whipping
them in their night-dresses; tying
their hands and feet and ducking them;
and by other forms of punishment which
no man should ever inflict upon a woman.</p>

<p>“Fifth. That names of children committed
to said school have been changed
and altered by the officers of the said institution.</p>

<p>“Sixth. That children have been apprenticed
to persons living in remote
sections of the country, and who have
no interest in taking proper care of
them, and that a needless disregard to
the rights and feelings of their parents
has often been evinced by the officers of
the school.</p>

<p>“Seventh. That the goods of said
school are reported to have been used
dishonestly for purposes for which they
were not intended, and that the state of
Rhode Island is said to have been
charged with the board of children who
were living at service and were no expense
to said school.</p>

<p>“Eighth. That a spirit of proselytism
and of religious intolerance has prevailed
in the school, as is shown in the fact
that children of different creeds are compelled
to attend a form of worship which
is contrary to the conscientious convictions
of a large majority of them; which
is directly in conflict with the spirit and
letter of our state constitution, which ensures
to the inhabitants thereof the liberty
of conscience, in the following language:
‘No man shall be compelled to frequent
or to support any religious worship,
place, or ministry whatever, except in
fulfilment of his own voluntary contract;’
and that the children of said school are
denied the use of books and all religious
instruction in the religion of their choice.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Although there is evidence in the
volume of <i>Investigation</i> before us
tending to sustain the “fifth” and
“seventh” charges, we yet except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
those two charges from our remark,
when we say that the other six
charges, constituting the gravamen
of the prosecution, are not only sustained
in whole or in part by nearly
one hundred witnesses, but, with all
deference to the five aldermen out
of ten who found most of them <i>not
proved</i>, we think that no unbiassed
reader of the heavily laden and sad
volume before us, no true philanthropist,
no man of true charity, can fail
to pronounce the word <i>guilty</i> as to
all or some part of every one of the
first, second, third, fourth, seventh,
and eighth charges. We are sorry
to be forced to the conviction that
the testimony is overwhelming.
There are cases of punishment cruel
in the extreme&mdash;some have called
them inhuman, and even brutal&mdash;inflicted
on about sixty boys; and,
while nearly every page shows this,
we refer particularly to pages 112,
123, 172, 234, 238, 274, 279, 280,
281, 289, 290, 295, 318, 364, 366,
375, 379, 383, 387, 388, 402, 403,
410, 414, 416, 419, 421, 425, 432,
437, 440, 446. See evidences more
particularly referring to the use of
the loaded whip, page 378; the
strap, the cat, the strings, 286,
339; the butt, 492; blood drawn,
364, 485; terrorism, 239, 269,
270, 305, 371, 418, 424, 425, 492;
whipping little boys over the knuckles
with a bunch of keys, 146, 147;
kicking, 447, 485, 526, and 323
of vol. ii.; boys struck on the
head with a hammer, 331, 379; profanity
and indecency, 280, 302, and
page 135 of vol. ii.; Catholic books
taken away from Catholic children,
308, 309, 310; state of Rhode Island
charged with board of children who
had been put out of the institution,
307, which was regarded as “an error
of the head and not of the heart,”
327 of vol. ii.</p>

<p>There are also detailed in the <i>Investigation</i>
cases of about thirty girls
punished in a cruel and revolting
manner. For girls lashed, bodies
striped and bruised, see pages 18,
19; a girl struck, caught by the
throat, pounded, and dragged by the
hair of the head, 23; a girl struck
with fist, and black eye, 55; a girl
stripped to the waist of all her clothes,
except undergarment, and whipped
with cat-o’-nine-tails, and body marked,
93; another girl dragged by the
hair, 95; a girl ducked, 102; a girl
boxed until her nose bled, and water
dashed on her, 102; a girl chased,
kicked, and held under flowing water,
108; a girl dragged by the hair,
kicked, and ducked, 219, 220; another
girl dragged by the hair and
kicked, 228; another lashed black
and blue, 229; a girl lashed on the
back after she had gone to bed, 338;
another girl whipped with the straps,
and kicked, 344; another girl stripped
to the waist, leaving only undergarment
on, and whipped with a
knotted strap, 360; a girl ducked,
272. A mother is refused permission
to see her child, who was whipped,
and refused information as to whither
the child was transported. The
mother said: “I will travel Rhode
Island through, and I will travel
Connecticut through, but what I will
find her. I have not seen her for
the last six or eight years, and a
mother’s nature goes beyond any
mortal thing in this world. A mother
wants to see her child. I could not
get anything from them,” 374. Another
girl is stripped like the others,
and lashed, marked, and scarred on
the back, 395. A witness, at page
396, says: “I saw&mdash;&mdash; stripped with
her dress down; she was badly bruised
on the shoulder; I did not see
any blood, but I saw the bruises were
pretty bad bruises; there were scars
clear across her shoulders; you could
not see scarcely a piece of plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
flesh on her shoulders.” At page
443, a former inmate testifies to the
treatment received by another inmate:
“I saw him shower her and
strike her; he knocked her against
the building with his fist, and the
blood ran out of her nose and ears
while she was by the fence, while he
stood there punishing her.” At page
454, we read an extract from the testimony
of a Mrs. Bishop: “Q. Were
you ever kicked or beaten in the
school by&mdash;&mdash;? A. Yes, sir. I was
punished up-stairs because I could
not learn my lesson. I had had no
schooling at that time; I could not
do much reading; he punished me
up-stairs; I told him I could not
learn it, unless he could let a girl
come up and help me; I was told to
kneel down; I looked around, and
he kicked me across the aisle; he
pulled me by my dress, and kicked
me across the aisle, and twice across
the room; I was put up-stairs before
devotions were to come off; I said I
was going to tell my mother; he said
I could not see my folks again if I
did tell her; he was going to give
me two hundred dollars if I had not
said anything; I was sick after this
kicking; he carried me home himself
away from the school; I could not
move nor stir; I could not move one
eye; I walked on crutches after it;
it affects me now; affects my gait,
so I can’t walk all the time; I have
to hire my work done part the time
now; when there comes a storm, I
can’t move, I have to sit still in the
house; sometimes I have to lie in
bed, because it affects me so; I was
thirteen years old at that time.” A
girl, a new-comer only three days in
the school, is ducked, strapped, and
locked up two days for laughing in
school, p. 629, and further ill-treated,
639. Another girl dragged by
the hair, pounded, and dreadfully
bruised, 661. Girls ducked and whipped
at night, 678. Girls called names
of supreme contempt by teachers
in allusion to their past lives, 684,
737, and 39, 71, 317, of vol. ii. A
girl taken up at night, and whipped

<p>The first charge, the most serious
that could be brought against a
school of <i>reform</i>&mdash;“crimes against
chastity, decency, and good morals”&mdash;is
fearfully sustained. One of the
employees, a man of years, who had
become notorious for his vulgarity
and indecency in both the male and
female departments, to both of which
he had access, is caught <i>flagrante
delicto</i>. The partner of his sin was
one of the female inmates, who was
sent there to be <i>reformed</i>, and they
were detected by other female inmates
of this school of reform (page
75). And again, <i>horribile dictu</i>, a
<i>teacher</i> in the same nursery of <i>reform</i>
lived, “month in and month out,” in
criminal conversation with one of the
inmates of the female department
(pages 63, 76), and the appalling fact is
again proved by the defence (ii. 322).
But, more shocking than all this, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
only were immodest and indecent
conversations held by an employee
with the boys and girls, but another
fiend in the flesh, an officer of the
Providence School of Reform, introduced
among the boys and taught
them habits the most immoral and
disgusting, destructive at once of
their souls and bodies, of their manhood,
and of their temporal and eternal
happiness. This fact is proved
solely by the defence at page 321 of
vol. ii. The offender was dismissed,
but the school still exists! Where
are Sodom and Gomorrah?</p>

<p>The evidence for the defence consists
chiefly of denials and <i>non-mi-ricordos</i>
by the officers and employees;
but some of the charges are
proved by the defence itself, and
some of the most damning evidence
against the institution came from this
very quarter. The mayor and one
of the aldermen declined to take any
part in the decision, because they
were members of the board of trustees.
Three other aldermen refused
to sign the decision, and gave decisions
of their own, finding portions of
the charges true. Five out of ten
of the judges sign the decision, which,
while finding most of the charges <i>not
proved</i>, strongly inculpates the institution
on several of the charges. In
it is stated that two instances have
occurred of offences against chastity,
decency, and good morals, on the
part of officers and female inmates,
page 384 of vol. ii.; that knocking
down was practised, though alleged
to have been in self-defence; and
that boys were whipped on the bare
back, 384 of vol. ii.; that girls have
had their dresses loosened and removed
from the upper part of the
back and shoulders, leaving only the
undergarment on, and thus punished
by the (male) superintendent; and
in a very few cases during the past
nine years, when they have, in violation
of the rules of the school, made
loud noises and disturbances in the
dormitories at night, they have been
punished in their night-clothes (by a
male officer) in the presence of a
female officer, page 385 of vol. ii.;
ducking is admitted, page 385.</p>

<p>One of the dissenting aldermen in
his decision says: “Being fully aware
that the class of inmates sent to this
school require a strong and efficient
discipline, and not feeling competent
to say what that discipline should be,
yet I cannot resist the conviction
that the punishments described have
a tendency to <i>degrade rather than to
elevate</i>, not only the one who receives,
but the one who administers
them.” “I therefore feel bound to protest
against such punishments, and
earnestly hope that some better mode
of discipline will speedily be adopted
by the managers of this institution”
(p. 394, vol. ii.). The superintendent
stated on oath that, in case a child
sick and <i>in extremis</i> required a Catholic
priest to be sent for, he would
first go and seek the advice of
three or four of the trustees before
he would admit, even under such circumstances,
a Catholic or any other
clergyman; and on this subject the
same alderman remarked: “In my
view, any superintendent of this institution
who would hesitate to allow
the consolations of religion to be administered
in the form desired by
the child, under such circumstances,
should be promptly relieved from
duty,” page 396 of vol. ii. Another
alderman says: “I am of opinion
that cruel and unnecessary punishment
has been inflicted. I do not
suppose that striking with the
clenched fist, kicking, or dragging by
the hair of the head has been common,
but I think it has occurred in
some instances,” page 397; and he
mentions the case of an “unfortunate
girl who seems to have suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
every form of discipline known to
this school, from being <i>ducked</i> to
being ‘pushed under the table with
the foot.’ If it be said she was vile,
I would ask how she came to be?
She was but six or seven years of age
when she entered this institution.
No one is wholly bad at that tender
age. She remained under its care
and influences for <i>nine years</i>, and, if
she is vicious and dissolute, why is
she so? If, on the other hand, she
was insane, is it not painful to reflect
that such punishments were inflicted
on an irresponsible child?” (p. 399.)
One of the trustees actually resigned
a year before the investigation, rather
than be connected with such
scenes; he started an investigation,
but it seems to have done no good;
and such was the condition of things
at the time of this first investigation
that the assistant superintendent offered
to give one hundred dollars to
a friend to shield him from being
called as a witness.</p>

<p>The religious instruction given in
this institution is <i>of course</i> unsectarian;
everything distinctively Episcopalian
is denied to Episcopalian children,
everything distinctively Baptist
is denied to Baptist children,
everything distinctively Methodist is
denied to Methodist children, everything
distinctly Presbyterian is denied
to Presbyterian children, and
everything distinctly Catholic is denied
to Catholic children. Nothing
whatever is said tending “to keep
children in the faith to which they
belonged when they entered the
school.” “Q. Does not the system
of religious instruction tend to bring
the children to that form of religion
which gives to each person the private
judgment and interpretation of
the Scriptures? A. We hope it tends
to make them better. Q. Does it
not tend to have them choose their
own Bible and their own interpretation
of it as the source and principle
of religion? A. I should hope that
it tends to have them accept the
Bible. Q. Do you teach them the
doctrine of the private interpretation
of the Scripture? A. No, sir, not at
all. Q. As I understand it, all the
religious instruction they get is simply
reading from the Bible, and no
interpretation. They can interpret
it just as they please. A. They can
interpret it just as they please. Sometimes
one speaker comes, and sometimes
another” (page 234, vol. ii.)
... “Q. Now state the afternoon
services on Sunday? A. One
of the trustees (they all alternate except
the mayor) procures a speaker
for Sunday afternoon to address the
scholars. Q. Of what class are
those speakers&mdash;of any particular or
of all classes? A. Since I have
been there, I think every denomination
has been represented or been
invited to speak? Q. Are they particularly
members of churches, or
laymen, lawyers, doctors, or anybody
who will give a moral address to the
children? A. I could not speak
with certainty of the professions.
We often have clergymen, perhaps
oftener than any other class, but not
unfrequently men of other professions,
and many times those following
no profession to speak in connection
with others. We often have
more than one speaker&mdash;sometimes
half a dozen. Q. These are business
men of the city? A. Yes, sir.
Q. Do you have lawyers sometimes?
A. I think all professions are represented.
Q. Do you have ministers if
you can get them? A. Yes, sir.” And
yet in this unsectarianism the most
direct sectarianism prevailed. “Q. Do
you know what version of the Bible
is used? A. It is the common English
translation. Q. (By the mayor)
It is the ordinary Bible, is it
not? A. Yes, sir. (By Mr. Gorman)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The <i>Douay</i> is the ordinary one.
(By Mr.&mdash;&mdash;) We call that an <i>extraordinary</i>
one” (page 62, vol. ii.).</p>

<p>Now, we have the Bible without
comment, but ministers, lawyers,
doctors, and business men are called
in every Sunday, sometimes half a
dozen at one time, to give the comments,
each according to his own
view. Every religious denomination
was invited, but it does not appear
that any Catholic ever accepted the
invitation; for, if he accepted, he
would leave his Catholicity outside
until he finished his unsectarian discourse.
There may be something
in common with all the sects which
sometimes may be called general
Protestantism, though they profess
to call it unsectarianism; but one
thing we know is common to them
all, and this something is opposition
to Catholicity, and the dodge of unsectarianism
is adroitly invented in order
to exclude Catholics from enjoying
equal rights with Protestants in
matters relating to public education
and public charities. The state must
let religion alone, and unsectarians
must desist from their disguised effort
to unite church and state in this
country, while it has so strenuously
opposed their union in every Catholic
country. They know that Catholics
can take no part in unsectarian
teachings, but they would like
us to do so, for in proportion as we
did so would we cease to be Catholics.
The Catholic view was so admirably
expressed by the late Bishop
Fitzpatrick, of Boston, in his letter in
the Eliot School difficulty, that we
must give it to our readers:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I. Catholics cannot, under any circumstances,
acknowledge, receive, and
use, as a complete collection and faithful
version of the inspired books which compose
the written Word of God, the English
Protestant translation of the Bible.
Still less can they so acknowledge, accept,
or use it, when its enforcement as
such is coupled expressly with the rejection
of that version which their own
church approves and adopts as being correct
and authentic; and yet this is required
of them by law. The law, as administered,
holds forth the Protestant
version to the Catholic child, and says,
‘Receive this as the Bible.’ The Catholic
child answers, ‘I cannot so receive it.’
The law, as administered, says you must,
or else you must be scourged and finally
banished from the school.</p>

<p>“II. The acceptance and recital of the
Decalogue, under the form and words in
which Protestants clothe it, is offensive
to the conscience and belief of Catholics,
inasmuch as that form and those words
are viewed by them, and have not unfrequently
been used by their adversaries,
as a means of attack upon certain tenets
and practices which, under the teachings
of the church, they hold as true and
sacred.</p>

<p>“III. The chanting of the Lord’s
Prayer, of psalms, of hymns addressed to
God, performed by many persons in unison,
being neither a scholastic exercise
nor a recreation, can only be regarded as
an act of public worship&mdash;indeed, it is
professedly intended as such in the regulations
which govern our public schools.
It would seem that the principles which
guide Protestants and Catholics, in relation
to communion in public worship, are
widely different. Protestants, however
diverse may be their religious opinions&mdash;Trinitarians,
who assert that Jesus Christ
is true God, and Unitarians, who deny
he is true God&mdash;find no difficulty to offer
in brotherhood a blended and apparently
harmonious worship, and in so doing
they give and receive mutual satisfaction,
mutual edification. The Catholic cannot
act in this manner. He cannot present
himself before the Divine presence in
what would be for him a merely simulated
union of prayer and adoration. His
church expressly forbids him to do so.
She considers indifference in matters of
religion, indifference as to the distinction
of positive doctrines in faith, as a
great evil which promiscuous worship
would tend to spread more widely and increase.
Hence the prohibition of such
worship; and the Catholic cannot join in
it without doing violence to his sense of
religious duty.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Non-sectarianism is the plea upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which those public institutions justify
their interference with the religious
rights of their inmates. They
argue that, because this system is acceptable
to Protestants of every sect,
therefore it must be acceptable to
Catholics. Whereas, on the contrary,
what is called unsectarianism is the
concentration of sectarianism. Unsectarianism
is made up of all those
points upon which the sects concur,
and is therefore pre-eminently sectarian.
It is either that or simple
deism; for if you take away the
distinctive tenets of Catholics, Presbyterians,
Methodists, Baptists, and
of all the distinct sects, there remains
nothing but deism. This involves,
and will inevitably lead to, the denial
of revelation; and the very Scriptures
themselves, which Protestantism
claims as the sole source of religious
teaching, must and will inevitably,
if non-sectarianism long prevails,
be cast away. Is the teaching of
deism alone inoffensive to Christians?
The teaching of a few points, even if
agreed upon by all, would be, on account
of its exclusiveness, as sectarian
as any other religious system&mdash;indeed
more so; and is subject to
an objection not applicable to the
others, in that it conceals its true nature,
and assumes a false name:
whereas the Catholic Church and the
avowed sects proclaim their distinctive
and exclusive character, and in
this at least are truthful and honest.
If religious teaching resolves itself
into latitudinarianism, it then constitutes
a new sect in itself. A perfect
neutrality, as long as anything positive
is taught, is an impossibility.
This very selection, which makes up
this professed unsectarianism, is an
anti-Catholic principle. It proclaims
the right of man to determine all
things in religion by his own private
judgment, and in this consists the
distinctive feature of Protestantism.</p>

<p>We have thus shown that non-sectarianism,
as a system of religious
teaching, is an impossibility. We
now propose to show that in our
schools, asylums, reformatories, etc.,
it is in practice, as well as in theory,
an impossibility. We will show this,
too, by Protestant and unsectarian
authority. At p. 264, vol. ii., <i>Providence
Reform School Investigation</i>, we
read from the testimony of a Protestant
Episcopal trustee, who resigned
on account, in part, of this impossibility:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Q. Didn’t you know that no sectarian
instruction was admitted inside that institution?
A. I don’t know what you
call sectarianism. It is pretty hard to say
down in that school. We have had
everything taught and preached there.
Q. Was not this an Episcopal book?
A. It was a book of devotions and prayers&mdash;a
work by a divine of the English
Church. It was an Episcopal book. Q.
Do you mean to say that a book of Episcopal
exercises is or is not a sectarian
work? A. I am a member of the Episcopal
Church; we do not call ourselves a
sect. Q. Didn’t you know at the time
you gave this book to the teacher that
it was against the rules of the school to
have the doctrines of the true church
given out there, or of any church? A. I
had never supposed it was against the
rules of that institution, and I should have
been unwilling to have sat for one hour
as its trustee if I had supposed that I
was myself forbidden to pray, or to advise
others to pray there, through Jesus
Christ, our Lord; and if the prayers I
indicated, marked, and numbered in that
book are prayers forbidden in the Providence
Reform School or any other school,
I have for the first time to learn what
is sectarianism. They are prayers which
every Christian, whether he belongs to
any one of the various organizations of
Christians in this or any other country
or not, would, I think, be willing to use
morning, noon, and night. Q. Didn’t
you know that the by-laws place religious
instruction exclusively under the care of
the superintendent of the school” [who is
a layman]?</p>

<p class="p1">The Hon. John C. Spencer, Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of State and Superintendent of
Schools in 1840, said in his report to
the New York Legislature: “There
must be some degree of religious instruction,
and there can be <i>none</i> without
partaking more or less of a <i>sectarian
character</i>. <i>The objection itself
proceeds from a sectarian principle</i>, and
assumes the power to control that
which it is neither right nor practicable
to subject to any denomination.
Religious doctrines of vital interest
will be inculcated.”</p>

<p>Another who has discussed this
question of sectarianism with force
and great plainness of speech is the
Rev. Dr. Spear, of Brooklyn, in the
columns of the <i>Independent</i>, thus:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is quite true that the Bible, as the
foundation of religious belief, is not sectarian
as between those who adopt it;
but it is true that King James’ Version
of the Holy Scriptures is sectarian as to
the Catholic, as the Douay is to the Protestant,
or as the Baptist Version would be
to all Protestants but Baptists. It is
equally true that the New Testament is
sectarian as to the Jew, and the whole
Bible is equally so as to those who reject
its authority in any version....
There is no sense or candor in a mere
play on words here. It is not decent in
a Protestant ecclesiastic, who has no
more rights than the humblest Jew, virtually
to say to the latter: ‘You are
nothing but a good-for-nothing Jew; you
Jews have no claim to be regarded as a
religious sect, or included in the law of
state impartiality as between sects which
Protestants monopolize for their special
benefit. Away with your Jewish consciences!
You pay your tax bills, and send
your children to the public schools, and
we will attend to their <i>Christian</i> education.’
It is not decent to say this to any
class of citizens who dissent from what is
known as Protestant Christianity. It is
simply a supercilious pomposity of which
Protestants ought to be ashamed. It may
please the bigotry it expresses, but a
sensible man must either pity or despise
it. In the name of justice we protest
against this summary mode of disposing
of the school question in respect to any
class of American citizens. It is simply
an insult.”</p>

<p class="p1">Again, Dr. Anderson, President
of the Rochester University, one of
the first men in the Baptist Church in
these United States, addressing the
Baptist Educational Convention in
the city of New York, says:</p>

<div class="pbq ">

<p class="p1">“<i>It is impossible for an earnest teacher to
avoid giving out constantly religious and
moral impulses and thought. He must of
necessity set forth his notions about God, the
soul, conscience, sin, the future life, and Divine
Revelation.</i></p>

<p>“If he promises not to do so, he will
fail to keep his word”&mdash;these are true
words&mdash;“or his teachings in science, or
literature, or history will be miserably shallow
and inadequate. Our notions of God
and the moral order form, in spite of
ourselves, the base line which affects all
our movements and constructions of science,
literature, and history. Inductions
in physics, classifications in natural history,
necessitate a living law eternal in
the thought of God.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">These gentlemen speak of religious
instruction, only inasmuch as it is
connected with the education of
youth, and yet their logical minds
showed them the absurdity of unsectarianism.
What, then, could they
have said of visionary men attempting
direct teaching of religion without
sectarianism?</p>

<p>The following extract is too pertinent
to our subject and too clever to
be omitted, as an illustration of the
impossibility of teaching religion upon
the unsectarian system:</p>

<p class="pc2 mid">“UNSECTARIANISM.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF A TEACHER IN A
MIXED SCHOOL.</p>

<p class="pc1">(From the New Orleans Morning Star.)</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">We find the following in our San Francisco
contemporary, the <i>Pacific Churchman</i>,
taken originally from the <i>London
Church Review</i>, an organ of the Church
of England. The editor of the <i>Churchman</i>
remarks that “with some changes it
will equally apply to some of our <i>un</i>-sectarian
schools.” As far as the <i>Churchman</i>
goes against <i>un</i>-sectarian schools in
this country, we are with it. This seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to be one scene taken from others. Considering
that it conveys a good argument
for us, our readers will excuse the term
“Romanism,” thrown in as a reproach.
We quote:</p>

<p>The schoolroom of a boarding-school.
Time, the hour of religious instruction.
Bible to be read and explained without
inculcating the dogmas of any particular
denomination. Teacher certificated, unsectarian,
highly conscientious. Class
consisting of children from thirteen down
to six or seven, and of various grades,
from respectable poor to gutter children.
Schoolroom and teacher span new.
Teacher a little nervous. Children&mdash;some
looking curiously about them,
some disposed to loll and idle, some attentive.
Teacher opens the great Bible,
and begins to read St. Matthew ii., as
being a narrative likely to interest the
auditory, and easy to explain in an undenominational
sense. First, however, a
little preliminary explanation is necessary.</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> You must know, my dear
children, that Joseph and Mary were two
very good people who lived a very great
many years ago in a country far away
from London, and I am going to read to
you about them and their son (reads
slowly verse 1. of the chapter).</p>

<p><i>Ragged Arab</i> (not accustomed to observe
much ceremony). Please, sir, who’s
that?</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (aghast, and wishing to gain
time). Whom do you mean, my boy?</p>

<p><i>Arab.</i> That there Jesus.</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (aside). [How can this question
be answered in an undenominational
sense? This is the religious difficulty,
full blown. If I say “a good man,” that
will hardly do, for I know several of the
boys are the children of the church people
and Romanists; and if I say “the son of
God,” that won’t do, for Tommy Markham
is a Unitarian, or, at any rate, his
parents are; besides, such a dogmatic
statement is sectarian.] (Aloud.) I will
explain all about him when I have finished
the chapter.</p>

<p>Continues to read. The class listens
with various degrees of attention until
the 11th verse is finished, and then&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A Boy.</i> Please, sir, who’s Mary? The
mother of the little baby, wasn’t she?</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> Yes; she was his mother.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Oh! and what does “wusshupped”
mean?</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> It means paying great respect,
kneeling down and bowing, as we
should to God.</p>

<p><i>Another Boy</i> (better taught than boy
No. 1, and jumping at once to a sectarian
conclusion). Then, that there baby was
God, sir?</p>

<p><i>Tommy Markham</i> (stoutly). No, that he
wasn’t!</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> Silence, boys, the lesson cannot
go on if you talk and quarrel.
(Struck by a bright idea.) You know
that a great many people believe that he
was God; but some do not; but we must
not quarrel because we do not all think
alike.</p>

<p><i>First Boy</i> (disagreeably curious). Well,
but what do <i>you</i> think, master?</p>

<p>[Terrible dilemma! Teacher hesitates.
At length, desperately]&mdash;</p>

<p><i>I</i> think he was God.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Don’t yer <i>know</i> it?</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (aside). [Perverse youth.
Pest take his questions and him too! If
I’d known what “unsectarian” teaching
involved, I’d sooner have swept a crossing.
What <i>will</i> the Board say? Why,
the very essence of our principle is to
<i>know</i> nothing and think anything. But
you can’t make the boys reason.]
(Aloud.) My dear boy, it is very difficult
to say what we know. I can only teach
you what I think, and teach you how to be
good and do what is right, and obey all
that God tells you to do in this Holy
Book.</p>

<p><i>A Boy</i> (interrupting, <i>sans cérémonie</i>).
Did God write that there book?</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> Yes; and he tells us what we
are to do to get to heaven; and his son
came, as you see, as a little child, and
when he grew up, he preached and told
us how we ought to love one another, and
all we ought to do to lead a good life.</p>

<p><i>Boy</i> (interested). And was he a <i>very</i>
good chap?</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (a little shocked). Yes, of
course; you know he was&mdash;[pauses; his
haste had almost betrayed him into a
dogmatic explanation, and the forbidden
word “know” had actually passed his
lips].</p>

<p><i>Another Boy</i> (with vexatiously retentive
memory). You said afore, master, that he
was God, and the gentlemen wusshupped
him&mdash;was he <i>reelly</i> God?</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (boldly, taking the bull by the
horns). Yes.</p>

that it is as sectarian to deny to
the Blessed Virgin the title of Mother of
God as to bestow it upon her; continues]:
yes, she worshipped him too; but
I want you to learn about the things that
he told us to do.</p>

<p><i>Another Boy</i> (doggedly). But we wants
to know fust who he be, ‘cause we ain’t
to do jist what a nobody tells us; only, if
that there gentlemen be God, there’s
somethin’ in it, ‘cause I’ve ‘eard parson
say, at old school, where I was once, that
what God said was all right.</p>

<p><i>Teacher</i> (aside). [Certainly that poor
Arab has got the root of denominational
education. It is, I begin to think, a failure
to attempt the teaching of morality
without first making manifest what that
morality is based upon, and the moment
you come to <i>that</i> you are in for denominationalism
at once. (Wipes his brow
and continues)&mdash;</p>

<p>Of course, my boy, you must know
why it is right to tell the truth and do
what is right, but then if I tell you God
commanded all this and read to you what
his Son said about it, there is no need for
troubling so much about&mdash;about&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Boy</i> (interrupting). Oh! but I likes to
ax questions, and it ain’t no sort of use
you telling us it’s wrong to lie&mdash;nobody
at ‘ome ever told me <i>that</i>&mdash;if yer don’t
say who said it, ‘cause I ain’t bound to
mind what <i>you</i> say, is I?</p>

<p>[<i>Teacher</i> checks the indignant “Indeed
you are” that rises to his lips, arrested by
the terrible and conscientious thought
whether it be not a new and strange form
of denominationalism for the teacher to
make his own dictum infallible in matters
of morality. Would not this be to elevate
into a living, personal dogma an unsectarian
teacher?&mdash;a singular clash,
surely. Teacher shivers at the bare idea.
Soliloquizes: How can I meet this
knock-down reasoning? These Arabs
are so rebellious, so perverse; why must
they ask so many questions, and require
to know the why and wherefore of everything?
(Glances at the clock.) Ah!
thank my stars, the time is almost up!
but this dodge won’t do every time. I’m
afraid I shall have to give up the whole
thing as a bad job.] (Aloud.) We have
only five minutes more to-day, lads, so
you must let me finish the chapter without
asking any more questions.</p>

<p>(Boys relapse into indifferent silence.
Curtain falls.)</p></div>

<p class="p1">In conclusion, we insist that the
state shall obey its own constitution,
and let religion alone. In purely
state institutions, the consciences
must be left free, and no experiments
with religion can be tried. Every
child in such institutions must enjoy
liberty of conscience and free access
to its own ministers and sacraments.</p>

<p>If any sect undertakes to help the
state to do its work, by establishing
reformatories, protectories, and asylums
for its own children, excluding
all other religions and the children
of other religions, we shall not object
to its receiving a just <i>per capita</i> from
the state; and under this system we
claim the same and no more for
purely Catholic institutions doing
the work of the state in respect to
Catholic children. If, however, sectarian,
unsectarian, or non-Catholic
institutions receive support from the
state, and receive the children of the
Catholic Church and of other persuasions,
they must be conducted upon
the same principle with state institutions,
and in them “no law respecting
the establishment of a religion”
must be made or enforced, but the
most perfect liberty of conscience
must prevail. We ask no special
favors for ourselves or our church;
all we claim is perfect equality before
the law and the state, and the full
benefit of that fair play which we
extend to others.</p>

Ottocar, King of Bohemia, Philip III. of France, Henry of Navarre, Peter III. of Aragon, Charles I.

<h2><a name="c27" id="c27">THE RUSSIAN IDEA.</a></h2>

<p class="pc1 mid">FROM THE GERMAN OF CONRAD VON BOLANDEN.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">“We must obey the emperor rather than God.”</p>

<p class="pc1">I.</p>

<p class="pc1">A GOOD MOTHER.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Baroness Olga von Sempach
was respected, wealthy, benevolent,
and therefore loved by the poor.
When, in the summer, she visited her
estates in Posen, to breathe for some
months the healthy country air, the
poor of that place would exclaim:
“Our mother has come again!”</p>

<p>The baroness had, however, seemed
lately to be greatly depressed, and
her sad countenance had excited the
sympathy of every one.</p>

<p>“Our mother is sick,” said the
poor. “Her face is pale, and her kind
eyes look as though she wept often.
We will pray for our benefactress,
that God may preserve her to us.”</p>

<p>And in the hours of want and suffering,
many hands were raised in
supplication to heaven for their mother
Olga; but the eyes of the noble
lady continued to be dim with weeping,
and her sorrow seemed to increase
daily.</p>

<p>She was sitting, one morning, in a
room of her palace; her hands were
clasped together, and she gazed absently
before her, while tear after tear
streamed down her cheeks. Opposite
to her on the wall hung a crucifix,
upon which she would often fix her
eyes; but her sufferings seemed to be
those of the spirit rather than of the
body. The affliction of soul, as seen
in her distressed face, had something
sublime and venerable in it, for it was
the grief of a mother.</p>

<p>The sound of approaching footsteps
are heard. The baroness made
an effort to conceal her agitation; she
wiped away her tears, and endeavored
to receive with a smile the young
man, who, upon entering, saluted her.</p>

<p>“I am rejoiced, dear Edward, that
you have come to visit us at our
retired summer-residence,” said she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
“The invigorating air of the country
will be of great service to you. Your
incessant application to study is injurious
to health, and you must
therefore remain with us for several
weeks.”</p>

<p>He hardly seemed to hear her
words of welcome, so lost was he
in astonishment at the appearance of
his noble hostess.</p>

<p>“I must ask your pardon, gracious
lady, for having disturbed your quiet
household last night at such a late
hour,” said he; “but the train was
delayed, and I could not find a carriage
to bring me here.”</p>

<p>“No formal excuse is necessary,
Edward! Have you spoken yet
with my son?”</p>

<p>“Only a few words. He is writing
to his betrothed.”</p>

<p>These latter words made such an
impression upon the baroness that it
seemed as though a sword had pierced
her heart. The emotion did not
escape the observation of the young
gentleman, and, together with her
sad aspect, convinced him that her
son was in some way the cause of her
unhappiness.</p>

<p>“O sorrowful mother that I am!”
she exclaimed, “to see my Adolph,
my only child, rushing into certain
misfortune, perhaps into eternal ruin,
and I unable to help or save
him&mdash;how it pains and terrifies me!”</p>

<p>Her lips trembled, and she found
difficulty in preserving her self-command.</p>

<p>“You alarm me, dear baroness!
Why should Adolph fall into such
deep misery because of his marriage
as you seem to predict? He loves
Alexandra truly and sincerely. He
praises her noble qualities, her magnificent
beauty, her accomplishments,
and therefore I see every prospect of
a happy life for them both.”</p>

<p>“Alexandra is beautiful, very beautiful!”
replied the baroness sadly;
“but this exterior beauty, perishable
and worthless as it is, unless united
with nobility of mind as well as virtue,
blinds my son. Alexandra’s personal
loveliness prevents him from seeing
the ugliness of her heart, mind, and
spirit.”</p>

<p>The young professor seemed really
perplexed. He knew that the baroness
was an admirable judge of character,
and he loved his friend.</p>

<p>“Adolph wrote to me in his last
letter that Alexandra is the daughter
of a Russian nobleman named Rasumowski,
who fills the distinguished
position of governor of a province in
Poland. I should think that the
daughter of a man to whom the
Russian government has confided
such a trust would resemble her
father.”</p>

<p>“She is his counterpart,” replied
the Baroness von Sempach; “and
her father is the incorporate spirit of
the Russian form of government; he
is imperious, proud, tyrannical, and
utterly destitute of feeling. You
know the inhumanities practised by
Russia upon Catholic Poland. An
endless succession of oppressive laws
completely crushed the unhappy
Poles, from whom everything was
taken&mdash;liberty, religion, property, and
life. In this atmosphere of cruel tyranny
and injustice Alexandra has
grown up. From her childhood she
has breathed an air which has stifled
all the gentle emotions of the heart.
In a word, Alexandra is a thorough
Russian. How, then, can my son,
with his respect for the rights of man,
with his enthusiastic love of freedom
with his studious disposition of mind,
and his warm heart&mdash;how can he be
happy in the possession of such a
wife? Never! A terrible awakening,
bitter sorrow, and lasting misfortune
will soon poison the life of my
child.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, dear madame!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Why have you not expressed your
fears to Adolph?”</p>

<p>“I have done so often and urgently;
but his blind passion for Alexandra
makes him deaf to all my representations.”</p>

<p>“If,” said Edward, after some
reflection, “we could only succeed
in letting Adolph have a closer insight
into Alexandra’s nature and spiritual
life, I am sure that he would turn
with aversion from her.”</p>

<p>“But in this lies the difficulty, dear
Edward. The Russians understand
well how to conceal by an artificial
gloss of refinement their real spiritual
deformity.”</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding all this, the
mask must be torn from the face of
the Russian lady, in order to save
Adolph. I know what to do! My
plan will succeed!” exclaimed the
professor.</p>

<p>“What do you intend doing, Edward?”</p>

<p>“I will enlighten my friend Adolph
in regard to Russian manners. Do
not question me any further, dear
madame, but confide in me!” said he,
with a cheerful face. “Wipe away
your tears, and have courage, noble
mother!”</p>

<p>He bowed and then sought the
presence of his host. Adolph, a stately
young man with a kind face and
the expressive eyes of his mother,
had just concluded a letter to his betrothed.</p>

<p>“Have you at last finished writing?”
asked Edward. “You lovers
never know when to stop. I wonder
what you have to say to each other
day after day?”</p>

<p>“A heart that loves is inexhaustible,”
replied Adolph. “I could
write ten letters a day, and not say
all I wish.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Edward, nodding
his head.</p>

<p>“What do you know?”</p>

<p>“The readiness of love to make
sacrifices,” replied his friend.</p>

<p>Adolph laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“The idea of your understanding
what it is to love! When you begin
to love, the world will come to an
end!” he exclaimed good-humoredly.
“As the city of Metz has inscribed
over her gates, so also can you write
upon your forehead, ‘No one has
ever conquered me.’ Although you
speak with great wisdom about many
things, you know nothing of love.”</p>

<p>“But I am of the opposite opinion,”
said Edward, looking with his
brilliant eyes at the laughing face of
his friend. “Your love is about six
months old, but mine has lasted for
ten years; it commenced when I was
sixteen. My love has been put to
the test, and is still as enduring as it
was in the beginning. Your young
love of only six months’ duration must,
however, be tried as yet. How will
it be when ten years have passed
away, and Alexandra’s beauty has
faded? My beloved, on the contrary,
never grows old. She is always young
and beautiful, like her Father, the
eternal fountain of all knowledge&mdash;like
God; for my beloved is&mdash;Knowledge.”</p>

<p>“You malicious fellow, to remind
me of Alexandra’s future wrinkles!
I do not care, however, for my betrothed
is at present the handsomest
girl living.”</p>

<p>“I will not deny the fact,” said
Edward. “And if you will introduce
me into the much-to-be-envied atmosphere
which the beautiful Russian
breathes, you will oblige me and
my beloved very much.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you!”</p>

<p>“I wish, in other words, to know
something of Russian affairs by means
of my own observations,” replied
Edward. “I would like to make a
study of her government for the
benefit of the Germans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“For the benefit of the Germans?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; for it is a well-known
fact that the Russian system of government
is to be gradually introduced
into the German Empire. A beginning
has already been made by enacting
the famous law against the
Jesuits and kindred orders. Alexandra’s
father is the highest official of
his district. Through him I could
easily obtain a peep into state matters,
if you would recommend me.”</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure, my
friend!” exclaimed Adolph, springing
from his chair in joyful surprise.
“We will go together. I will introduce
you myself to the governor, and,
while you labor in the interest of your
ever-youthful beloved, I will devote
myself to Alexandra.”</p>

<p class="pc1">II.</p>

<p class="pc1">THE PLETI.</p>

<p class="p1">Two days later, the friends were
sojourning in the Rasumowski palace,
a stately building, formerly the property
of a noble Polish family whose
only son now languished in Siberia.
When the guests arrived, the governor
was absent, but his daughter received
them with the greatest hospitality.
Edward found the youthful
Russian lady very beautiful in appearance,
but his keen eyes soon detected
beneath the surface of her charming
exterior a spirit of such moral deformity
that he became really alarmed in
regard to the fate which threatened
his friend if he persisted in uniting
himself to such a being.</p>

<p>“Oh! what joy! What an agreeable
surprise!” exclaimed Alexandra.
“It is, in truth, an imperial joy! And
papa also will be imperially delighted
to see you and your friend.”</p>

<p>“Is your father absent, Alexandra?”
asked Adolph.</p>

<p>“Only for a few hours. He is
with a distinguished gentleman from
Berlin. I expect him any moment,
and his surprise will be really imperial.”</p>

<p>The professor seemed astonished
at her language. He availed himself
of the first suitable opportunity to
satisfy his desire for knowledge.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, mademoiselle; you
use the word imperial in a manner
which is incomprehensible to me&mdash;you
speak of a really imperial joy, of
a truly imperial surprise. Will you
permit me to ask you why you make
use of this peculiar expression?”</p>

<p>“If you had ever travelled through
the holy Russian Empire,” she replied,
with a haughty look, “you
would know that we use the word
imperial in the same sense as you
in Germany say divine. Are you
amazed at that?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, mademoiselle,” answered
the professor calmly, “I never imagined
that the words imperial and
divine could be synonymous, for the
reason that there is an infinite difference
between the emperor and God.”</p>

<p>“That is your view of the subject,
but we think differently in our holy
empire,” replied the arrogant beauty.
“In Russia, the emperor is the most
exalted of beings; he is the autocrat
of all Russia, and upon his dominions
the sun never sets. If we wish to
express the highest degree of joy, of
surprise, of pleasure, or of beauty”&mdash;and
she threw her head proudly back&mdash;“then
we say an imperial joy, an
imperial pleasure, an imperial beauty!”</p>

<p>“I am greatly indebted to you for
this interesting explanation,” said the
professor, bowing low.</p>

<p>At this moment, the sound of an
approaching carriage was heard.</p>

<p>“They have arrived!” said Alexandra.
“What a pity that our distinguished
visitor from Berlin makes
it necessary for papa to absent himself
so often!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your company, dear Alexandra,
is a charming substitute for your
father’s absence,” said Adolph von
Sempach.</p>

<p>Two loud male voices in animated
conversation resounded through the
corridor. Alexandra ran to open the
door of the salon.</p>

<p>“Papa, who do you think is
here? You will be delighted.”</p>

<p>“Who is it? Can it be Prince von
Bismarck?” replied a rough voice,
and the governor entered the room.
He was an elegantly dressed gentleman,
of stout appearance, and wore
a light mustache; but his rubicund
countenance, which plainly betokened
an unrestrained appetite, was almost
repulsive, on account of the cruel
look in his eyes. The visitor from
Berlin followed him; he was a tall,
broad-shouldered man, with a bald
head, sharp eyes, a heavy mustache,
which overshadowed an ugly mouth,
and with features not less disagreeable
than were those of the Russian.</p>

<p>“Oh, Baron von Sempach? Is
it possible!” exclaimed the governor,
pressing the hand of his future son-in-law.
“It is really imperial!”</p>

<p>“My friend Edward Beck, Professor
of History,” said Adolph, introducing
his travelling companion.</p>

<p>The untitled name seemed to displease
the Russian, for he looked
almost with contempt at the stranger,
and returned his bow with a scarcely
perceptible nod of the head. Von
Sempach noticed this reception of his
friend, and, although very angry,
hastened to pacify the ill-humor of
his proud host.</p>

<p>“I must inform you, governor,”
said he, in a whisper, “that my friend
Edward Beck occupies a distinguished
social position; and not only
that&mdash;he is the owner of vast estates,
and the possessor of two millions of
guilders.”</p>

<p>“I feel highly honored at your
presence in my house, Herr Beck,”
said the now polite Russian. “Allow
me to introduce to you my esteemed
guest, Herr Schulze, of Berlin.”</p>

<p>The tall Prussian made a desperate
effort to smile, and to force his rigid,
military figure to return the professor’s
bow.</p>

<p>“The visit of my friend to your
country has, at the same time, a scientific
object in view,” said Adolph.
“He desires to learn something of
Russian affairs by personal observation.
You will therefore oblige me
very much, Governor Rasumowski,
if by means of your high official
position you consent to further his
wishes in this respect.”</p>

<p>“What a happy coincidence!” replied
the governor, with a significant
glance at the gentleman from Berlin.
“Herr Schulze has come for the same
purpose. He also seeks to inform
himself in regard to the glorious administration
of state and social
affairs in our holy empire; but of
course with a different motive from
that of Herr Beck, whose researches
are of a purely historical nature.”</p>

<p>“The knowledge of which I am
in pursuit is for practical ends,” said
Herr Schulze, assuming a learned air.
“I wish to examine and see if the
admirably constructed machinery of
the Russian government cannot be
introduced with advantage into the
new German Empire.”</p>

<p>“I am rejoiced to hear you speak
as you do,” replied Beck; “for your
opinion in regard to the policy now
in force throughout the new German
Empire corresponds with mine. Since
the last Diet, it has become evident to
me that in future Germany must be
governed as Russia now is. The
map of Europe,” he added, with a
meaning smile intended for Rasumowski,
“would then not only have a
Russian Poland, but also a German
Russia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rejoice at such a beneficial
change, gentlemen!” exclaimed the
governor. “All nations can learn
from and profit by the example of
our holy Russian Empire. In no
country upon earth is there a stronger
government, and nowhere has the
absurd idea of liberty taken less root,
than in the immense territory of the
czar. Of course, in Germany, some
little concessions must be made at
first, until an iron-bound constitution,
like that of Russia, can be formed&mdash;above
all, the inferior German princes
must be set aside.”</p>

<p>“The beginning has been already
made; it is only necessary to continue
our efforts,” replied the Berlin
gentleman.</p>

<p>“See with what regularity everything
proceeds with us,” asserted
Rasumowski. “All the wheels of
state are controlled by the will of one
man, of our gracious sovereign, the
emperor”&mdash;and he made a reverence
before the marble statue of the czar.
“Whoever does not obey the will of
the sovereign will be surely crushed
into atoms.”</p>

<p>A servant announced dinner. The
party entered the dining-room, where
a magnificent banquet was served.
The whole attention of Adolph was
absorbed by Alexandra, and Edward
saw with deep regret his burning
passion for a creature who was unworthy
of his noble-minded friend.</p>

<p>“As I said before, gentlemen, with
us everything moves with regularity,”
said Rasumowski. “We do not
permit the least contradiction. The
word liberty has no meaning with us;
for unconditional obedience is with
us the fundamental law of the empire,
and whoever does not wish to obey
must go to Siberia.”</p>

<p>“As far as I can understand, there
does not exist in Russia any fundamental
law of state,” said Beck.
“Or am I wrong?”</p>

<p>“No; you are right. We know
nothing about it. The sovereign law
is the will of the emperor. Nothing
but what the emperor commands has
legal power. The meeting of Deputies,
Chambers, and of Diets is unheard
of in Russia. The almighty will
of the czar answers instead of it. All
laws and decrees, no matter how long
they have existed, can be abolished
by the emperor with one stroke of the
pen. To him, as the sovereign, everything
belongs: the country and the
people, the peasants and the nobility,
the church and the state. In fact,
it can be said that the only fundamental
law of state in the holy Russian
Empire is absolute obedience to
the will of the czar.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” said Schulze. “If
we had only made the same progress
in our new German Empire!”</p>

<p>“It is to be questioned whether this
manner of government can be introduced
into Germany,” replied Beck.
“There the people have a will which
makes itself heard in the Chambers.”</p>

<p>“Bah! of what account are the
Diet and the Chambers?” exclaimed
Schulze contemptuously. “Acknowledge
candidly, Herr Beck, what a
miserable <i>rôle</i> our Chambers have recently
played. Is not the will of the
chancellor the only law? Is not
everything possible to the diplomatic
wisdom of Bismarck? Do the
Deputies, Chambers, or Diet dare to
contradict the all-powerful minister?
No! They only make such laws as
are pleasing to their master. Therefore
I am right when I say that the
people no longer have a voice in the
new German Empire. Wait a little
while, and the antiquated folly of
Chambers and Diets will be also
abolished.”</p>

<p>“Your view is not entirely correct,”
said Adolph von Sempach.
“A strong party in the Diet is opposed
to the designs of Bismarck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, the ultramontanes!” answered
Schulze. “But we are prepared
for them; we will conquer this rebellious
set, so hostile to the empire!”
he exclaimed, with an angry flash of
his eyes. “The ultramontanes in Germany
form only a rapidly disappearing
minority, and this rabble, so dangerous
to the state, will soon be exterminated.
Liberalism reigns supreme
in the new German Empire; Bismarck
depends upon its support. Every
right-thinking man will see that in a
well-organized state but one will must
be paramount, and not two or even
three wills. The emperor alone must
rule. Therefore away with the will
of the people, away with the will of
the church! The form of the Russian
government alone is sound; for
here the emperor is the head of
the state and of the church. The
civil officers rule according to the
command of the emperor&mdash;in a word,
everything is done, as the governor
has correctly remarked, with regularity.
And whoever does not
obey will be sent to the mines of
Siberia.”</p>

<p>Von Sempach, whose countenance
gave evidence of his disapproval,
wished to reply, but, at a sign from
his friend, he remained silent.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Siberia is a splendid
place!” exulted the Russian. “The
new German Empire must also have
a Siberia, to which her rebellious subjects
can be sent.”</p>

<p>“If German affairs continue to
shape themselves so closely after the
example of Russia, we will undoubtedly
have a Siberia very soon,” said
the professor, with an ambiguous
smile.</p>

<p>“Without Siberia, what would we
have done with the unruly Poles?”
exclaimed the charming daughter of
the governor. “There in the mines,
in want and misery, the wretches can
do penance for their presumption,
and repent for having disobeyed the
Emperor of Russia.”</p>

<p>At hearing her remarks, all color
forsook Adolph’s face; he looked
with amazement at his beautiful betrothed.
Beck, however, noticed with
secret delight the impression she had
made upon his friend.</p>

<p>“I am really anxious to learn,”
said he, “how the people of the
holy Russian Empire live, and if they
are so supremely happy.”</p>

<p>“You shall have proofs of it this
afternoon,” said the governor. “We
will drive in half an hour to a village
in the vicinity of the city. The village
is inhabited by Roman Catholics;
but even there you will find that the
will of the emperor is respected.”</p>

<p>All now rose from the table; the
guests retired to their rooms; but
Adolph, who seemed greatly depressed,
sought the society of his friend.</p>

<p>“How do you like Alexandra?”</p>

<p>“She is, in truth, imperially beautiful,”
answered Beck.</p>

<p>“But you heard her cruel remarks
about the poor Poles?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard what she said, and
am not astonished that a Russian
lady, whose father is governor, should
think as he does; it is very natural,”
replied the professor.</p>

<p>Adolph appeared to be overwhelmed
with sadness.</p>

<p>“Will you not go with us on our
tour of inspection?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>“After such a painful exhibition of
Alexandra’s sentiments, I need something
to distract my thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed that the bust
and portrait of the emperor, seated
on his throne, is to be seen in every
corridor, chamber, and salon of the
palace?” remarked Edward. “He is
like an idol in the house, before
which even the lovely head of Alexandra
bows in reverence. This fact
is of the highest interest to me. Man
must have a god, a sovereign being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to serve. In Russia, the emperor
is this sovereign; and Almighty God
in heaven is, as the Russians imagine,
the vassal of the emperor; for bishops,
priests, and popes can only teach
and preach that which the imperial
sovereign commands and permits.
And such a sovereign is to sit upon
the throne of the new German Empire!
A glorious prospect for us!”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous nonsense!” exclaimed
the young nobleman. “The German
nation would never submit to
such a yoke of tyranny. Germans
will never become slaves!”</p>

<p>“Do not be too confident, Von
Sempach! A keen observer has
said that the Germans are a most
servile people.”</p>

<p>“But they never will be the slaves
of a Russian czar,” replied Von Sempach.
“The German people, two
years ago, gave ample proofs of what
they can do. Like our imaginary
Michael,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> who for a long time allowed
himself to be kicked about and
abused, but who suddenly shook off
his lethargy, and fought like a lion,
so will it be with Germany, which
seems to have fallen into a state of
good-humored torpor, during which
cunning men have taken advantage
of her apparent indifference to deprive
her gradually of her ancient
privileges; but let the Germans once
feel the weight of Russian despotism,
and you will see with what fury they
will break loose the chains that bind
them.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, the carriage of
the governor rolled through the streets
of the city. He had given orders to be
driven over a well-paved public road
to a neighboring village. At a short distance
from the carriage followed four
Cossacks, mounted on small horses
from Tartary. One of them carried
in the belt of his sabre a very peculiar
instrument. Attached to a strong
wooden handle were nailed seven
straps of leather, which terminated in
hard knots. It was commonly called
“the pleti,” and was, by the command
of the Emperor Nicholas, used
as a substitute for the notorious
knout.</p>

<p>Just as the village became visible behind
the rows of trees that bordered the
public road, the governor commanded
the driver to stop. In looking
from the window, he had observed,
upon a lately cleared space, a collection
of wooden huts which were situated
a short distance from the road.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?
Who has dared to build these huts?”
he exclaimed, in amazement.</p>

<p>“They look very much like our
barracks in Berlin,” said Schulze.
“Some poor wretches built huts outside
of the city because they could
not earn enough to pay house-rent.
The fact of their being permitted to
remain so near Berlin is a disgrace
to the intelligence of the capital of
the new empire. It will be quite
difficult to remove them.”</p>

<p>“I shall not tolerate such things in
my district,” said the Russian abruptly.</p>

<p>The carriage proceeded on its way,
and stopped before a handsome
house, the residence of the mayor,
who was the only person in the village
who belonged to the Russian
state Church. This man had very
small eyes and an immense mustache;
and it was evident, from
the odor of his breath, that he had
been imbibing freely. When summoned
before the governor, he assumed a
most abject appearance, and his form
seemed really to shrink while in the
presence of the powerful official.</p>

<p>“What huts are those outside of
the village?” said Rasumowski, addressing
him roughly.</p>

<p>“To reply, with your honor’s permission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
they are the dwellings of
some poor people who have settled
there. They are very orderly, pay
their taxes punctually, and support
themselves by mending kettles, by
grinding scissors, by making rat and
mouse traps, and such means.”</p>

<p>“Who gave them permission to
settle there?”</p>

<p>“The parish, your honor. The
ground upon which the huts stand
belongs to the parish.”</p>

<p>“Listen, and obey my orders!”
said the governor. “These huts
must be taken down without delay;
for the emperor has not given this
ground to peasants, that they may
propagate like vermin. If the rabble
cannot rent houses in the village,
then they must go further, perhaps to
Siberia, where there is plenty of work
in the mines.”</p>

<p>The mayor of the village bowed
most obsequiously.</p>

<p>Beck watched his friend Adolph,
who seemed greatly revolted at the
inhuman command.</p>

<p>Herr Schulze, of Berlin, on the contrary,
looked as though he had heard
something that would prove of incalculable
benefit to mankind.</p>

<p>“On what text did the Catholic
pastor preach last Sunday?” asked
the governor.</p>

<p>“With the permission of your
honor, his sermon was on redemption
through Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>“Did he make no mention of the
emperor?”</p>

<p>“No, your honor.”</p>

<p>“Did he say nothing about the
obedience due the emperor?”</p>

<p>“No, your honor.”</p>

<p>“Go at once, and bring the priest
before me!”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, your honor, but he
has gone to visit a sick person at
some distance.”</p>

<p>“Then send him to me in the city.
To-morrow, at nine in the morning,
he must appear before me, and bring
his sermon with him!”</p>

<p>The mayor made an humble obeisance.</p>

<p>“Did the priest presume to say
anything about the Pope?”</p>

<p>“No, your honor; since the Roman
Catholic priests who preached
about the Pope were sent to Siberia,
nothing is said about him.”</p>

<p>“With regard to other matters, how
are things progressing in the village?”</p>

<p>“Admirably, your honor! After
the twenty Catholic families were
sent to Siberia, all the inhabitants are
willing to die in obedience to our
good emperor. The people are all
satisfied; no one wishes to go into
exile.”</p>

<p>“In how many villages of Germany,”
said the governor to his
guests, “can you find the people so
contented and ready to give their
lives in obedience to our good emperor?
The form of government in
the holy Russian Empire works miracles.
Now, gentlemen, follow me to
the schoolhouse, so that you may
see how Russia educates her subjects.”</p>

<p>They left the mayor’s residence,
and crossed the street to the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>“I must tell you in advance,”
observed Rasumowski, “that in Russia
we do not cultivate a fancy for
popular education. Our peasants
are only entitled to be taught three
things: to obey, to work, and to pay
taxes. In this consists their knowledge;
it is the axis around which revolves
our national education.”</p>

<p>He opened the school door.
About one hundred children, dirty
and poorly clad, sat upon the
benches. The schoolmaster, who
had already espied the arrival of the
governor, bowed in fear and trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“How is it with the children of
the emperor, teacher? Do you fulfil
your duty in obedience to my
orders?”</p>

<p>“I endeavor to do so, your
honor.”</p>

<p>“I shall convince myself, and ask
some questions from the catechism
of our state religion,” said the governor.</p>

<p>He called up several children, and
began to question them, which questions
were as remarkable and as interesting
to the professor as were the
answers.</p>

<p>“Who is your sovereign lord?”</p>

<p>“The good emperor of holy Russia.”</p>

<p>“What do you owe to the emperor?”</p>

<p>“Unconditional obedience, love,
and payment of taxes.”</p>

<p>“In what does the happiness of a
Russian consist?”</p>

<p>“In being a brave soldier of the
good emperor.”</p>

<p>“Where does the soul of man go
after death?”</p>

<p>“To heaven or to hell.”</p>

<p>“What soul goes to heaven?”</p>

<p>“That soul which always obeys
the good emperor and owes no
taxes.”</p>

<p>“What soul goes to hell?”</p>

<p>“That soul which was disobedient
to the emperor.”</p>

<p>The governor turned towards his
guests.</p>

<p>“You have already commenced a
system of compulsory education in
Germany,” said he; “but when you
succeed in establishing a state church,
and have a catechism of state religion,
then will the new German Empire, like
our czar, be able to educate subjects
who must obey him blindly.”</p>

<p>He now turned again to the children.</p>

<p>“Is there a pope in Rome?”</p>

<p>The child who was questioned
looked at the teacher, who had become
as pale as death.</p>

<p>“Answer me! Is there a pope in
Rome?” repeated the governor.</p>

<p>“No; there is only one emperor,
who is at the same time the pope of
all the Russians,” replied the child.</p>

<p>“Schoolmaster, I am satisfied with
you,” said Rasumowski approvingly.</p>

<p>“You know that the only things
which every good Russian must do
is to work diligently, to pay taxes
punctually, and to blindly obey the
emperor. These three things you
must impress upon the minds of the
children!”</p>

<p>The governor was about to leave
the schoolroom, when he suddenly
stopped, and his face became crimson
with anger. He had espied the portrait
of the emperor, which hung in a
gilt frame on the wall. The glass
that covered it was broken, and it
was soiled with a few ink-stains.</p>

<p>“Schoolmaster, what is this?” exclaimed
the governor furiously.</p>

<p>“Pardon, your honor!” implored
the trembling teacher. “A wicked
boy threw his inkstand at the picture.”</p>

<p>“And you, miserable wretch that
you are, left it thus disfigured upon
the wall! Follow me!”</p>

<p>The governor, with his guests and
the teacher, left the room, and entered
an office where the mayor held
his sessions.</p>

<p>“Schoolmaster!” began the governor,
“you deserve to be sent to Siberia,
for you Roman Catholics are
only fit for the mines. You refuse
blind obedience, and deny the right
of the emperor to command in
church affairs; you are constantly rebelling
against the empire, and all of
you should, therefore, be sent into
exile. For your insolence, however,
in leaving the portrait of our holy
emperor in this neglected state, you
will receive ten blows with the pleti.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>He stepped forward to the window,
and summoned the Cossack
who carried the instrument of torture.</p>

<p>“Corporal, give ten heavy strokes
with the pleti on this teacher’s
back!”</p>

<p>The Cossack seized a bench, and
motioned the teacher to stretch himself
upon it.</p>

<p>Von Sempach and Beck, finding it
impossible to conceal their indignation,
left the room. In going down-stairs,
they heard the whizzing
sound of the lash and the screams
of the poor teacher.</p>

<p>“I shall lose my senses,” said
Adolph, while waiting at the threshold.
“My God! has Alexandra grown up
amid such scenes?”</p>

<p>The professor was delighted to hear
this remark.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, a very demoralizing
atmosphere for a woman to breathe,”
said he.</p>

<p>“Can it be that Alexandra has
escaped the contaminating influence
of Russian customs? Has <i>she</i> also
lost all feeling and the delicacy of her
sex? We must find out, if possible.”</p>

<p>Rasumowski and Schulze approached.</p>

<p>“Ah! gentlemen,” exclaimed the
governor laughingly, “the singing
of the pleti caused you to leave!
Well, we Russians accustom ourselves
to such things. When, with other
practical institutions, the pleti is also
introduced into the new German
Empire, then you will learn to think
it as useful an instrument as is the
whip in the hands of the cartman.”</p>

<p>“Who drive oxen and donkeys,”
added the professor.</p>

<p>“Our new German Empire has already
introduced a punishment for
the soldiers, which causes as much
pain as the pleti,” said Adolph von
Sempach. “I have read repeatedly
in the newspapers that soldiers, while
upon drill, have fallen fainting to the
ground. The reason was their being
compelled to carry heavy stones in
their knapsacks, until their strength
gave way.”</p>

<p>“It is a Russian invention that
you have borrowed from us; we
have long practised it,” asserted
Rasumowski.</p>

<p>“And I suppose we have also
adopted your severe system of military
arrest, which Count von Moltke
justifies by ingeniously remarking
that even in time of peace the soldier
owes his health to his country.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true we keep up the
same strict discipline,” exclaimed the
Russian; “but Moltke should have
said that the soldier owes his health
and life to the <i>emperor</i>, and not to the
<i>country</i>. Words are useless; acts are
what we insist upon.”</p>

<p>When leaving the house, there
were a number of men, women, and
children outside who awaited the
governor. At seeing him, they all
fell upon their knees, and lifted up
their hands in supplication.</p>

<p>“Pardon! Mercy! Humanity!”
were heard in confused accents.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet!” commanded Rasumowski.
“Schulze, what does this
mean?”</p>

<p>“Your honor, these are the poor
people who live in the huts. They
ask you, for God’s sake, not to destroy
their only place of shelter.”</p>

<p>“Asking me to do a thing for
God’s sake!” exclaimed the governor
harshly. “If they had asked me
to do so for the emperor’s sake, I
would perhaps have granted their
request. Begone! Away with you!
My orders are to be obeyed!”</p>

<p>The people, however, did not rise,
but burst forth into fresh lamentations
and tears.</p>

<p>“Your honor,” said an old man,
“graciously listen to us, as the good
emperor would do, who always wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to help his people. We built those
huts by permission of the parish, and
we strive to make a living in an honest
way. We pay the taxes, and are
not in debt to the emperor. If your
honor destroys our huts, whither shall
we poor people go? Must we live
with the foxes and wolves in the forests?
Is this the will of the emperor?”</p>

<p>“The emperor desires his subjects
to live in comfortable houses, for
which reason the huts must be removed,”
answered Rasumowski.</p>

<p>“Your honor, we have no means
to build comfortable houses,” replied
the old man. “Look at the little
children; they will die if the orders
of your honor are executed.”</p>

<p>“I will hear no more: it is the
emperor’s will!” exclaimed the governor.</p>

<p>The words “It is the emperor’s
will” had the most disheartening effect
upon the poor people. The haggard,
wretchedly-clad assemblage
gave way to despair, but a low murmur
was all that was heard.</p>

<p>Rasumowski looked triumphantly
at his guests, as if he had said in so
many words: “You see what the
will of the emperor can do!”</p>

<p>But the professor was not to be
deceived. The suppressed wrath
plainly visible in the faces of the men
did not escape him.</p>

<p>A young man rose humbly from
his knees, and looked with strangely
glittering eyes upon the governor.</p>

<p>“It is not true!&mdash;the emperor does
not, cannot wish us to suffer!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Rasumowski looked with astonishment
at the bold youth.</p>

<p>“How do you know that it is not
the will of the emperor?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The emperor is human, but what
you command is inhuman!” answered
the intrepid peasant.</p>

<p>The Russian governor absolutely
trembled with anger.</p>

<p>“Fifteen lashes with the pleti&mdash;give
it to him soundly!” he cried, and
walked towards the carriage, which
drove slowly through the village.</p>

<p>Adolph von Sempach sat depressed
and silent. What he had seen
and heard did not tend to elevate
the character of the beautiful Alexandra
in his estimation, as her remarks
concerning the cruelties upon
the unfortunate Poles seemed to
prove that she had inherited the barbarous
disposition of her father.</p>

<p>“Do you hear the screams of the
insolent fellow?” said the governor.
“The pleti is unfortunately a poor
affair&mdash;it has not sufficient swing and
force. The old knout was much
better; for it was made of strong
leather straps, intertwined with wire.
The Emperor Nicholas I. introduced
this new knout, however&mdash;and whatever
the czar does, is well done; but
if I were consulted, I would bring
the old knout again into use.”</p>

<p>“I fear, governor,” said Beck
“that even the new knout or the
pleti would meet with invincible opposition
in Germany.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” answered the
Russian. “The Germans can also
be subdued&mdash;the German neck must
bow to him who has the power.
Now, gentlemen, I will show you
some evidences of the industry of our
farmers,” he continued, when the
carriage had left the village. “Look
at our abundant crops! The German
farmer can hardly excel the
Russian. You find everywhere signs
of prudent husbandry as well as of
diligence and perseverance.”</p>

<p>Herr Schulze gave a token of assent,
the professor knew nothing
about agriculture, and Von Sempach
preserved a gloomy silence.</p>

<p>“Do you see that village?” said
Rasumowski, pointing in a certain
direction. “All the inhabitants are
Roman Catholics, with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of the mayor, of course; but for ten
years they have been without a priest,
without divine service, without a
church.”</p>

<p>“I think I see a church,” remarked
Beck.</p>

<p>“Yes, the church is there, but it
has been closed for ten years. The
former Roman Catholic pastor, who
persisted in preaching upon the dignity
of man, the liberty of the children
of God, and even of the pope
and other dangerous things, was
transported to Siberia, and the church
was closed by my command.”</p>

<p>“I admire your eminently practical
method,” observed the guest
from Berlin. “We would not dare
as yet to do such a thing in the new
German Empire.”</p>

<p>“But it will be done in good
time,” replied the Russian.</p>

<p>The carriage, in returning, had by
this time reached the outskirts of the
city.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Herr Schulze in
joyful surprise, “the huts have already
disappeared. I shall write at
once to my friends in Berlin, and apprise
them of the expeditious manner
in which the Russian government
acts.”</p>

<p class="pr6">&mdash;<i>Robert Southwell, 1593.</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Concerning</span> the writer of these
beautiful lines, the English historian,
Stow, makes the following brief mention
in his <i>Chronicle</i>: “February 20,
1594-5.&mdash;Southwell, a Jesuit, that
long time had lain prisoner in the
Tower of London, was arraigned at
the King’s Bench bar. He was condemned,
and on the next morning
drawn from Newgate to Tyburn, and
there hanged, bowelled, and quartered.”
From this account we are
unable to discover that the man
whose judicial murder Stow thus records
was put to death for any offence
but that of being a <span class="smcap">Jesuit</span>, and
of having “long time lain in prison
in the Tower of London.” And yet,
in thus stating the case, Stow tells the
simple truth; for Southwell was guilty
of no more serious crime than his
sacerdotal character, and of suffering
the imprisonment and tortures inflicted
upon him in consequence thereof.
For three years previous to his death
he had been in prison and in the
Tower, had lain in noisome and filthy
dungeons, and been subjected many
times to torture and the rack. From
the high social position of his family,
the fame of his literary accomplishments,
his admirable and saintly bearing
as a missionary priest in England,
for six long years carrying his life in
his hand while ministering to a scattered
flock, obliged to move from
place to place in disguise as though
he were a malefactor, and finally,
from the wonderful fortitude and
constancy with which he was said to
have suffered torture, his case was
very generally known in London,
and deeply commiserated even by
many Protestants. So deep and
widespread, indeed, was this sympathy
that, when it was determined
by the officers of the crown to try
and condemn him on one and the
same day, and execute him the next
morning, they withheld from the public
all announcement of his execution,
meanwhile giving notice of the hanging
of a famous highwayman in another
place in order to draw off the
concourse of spectators. But it
availed not, for there were many who
kept so close a watch upon the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
at Newgate, to which prison
he had been removed a few days before
his trial, that, when Southwell was
brought out to be drawn on a sled or
hurdle to the place of execution at
Tyburn, he was followed by great
numbers of people, and among them
many persons of distinction, who
witnessed the carrying out of his
dreadful sentence, which was that he
should be “hung, bowelled, and
quartered.”</p>

<p>That our readers may understand
that our qualification of Southwell’s
execution as a judicial murder is not
the result of mere personal sympathy
or of religious prejudice, we will here
record the judgment of several Protestant
authorities, who speak out
concerning it in a manner not to be
misunderstood. In the valuable <i>Cyclopædia
of English Literature</i>, by
Chambers, we read concerning Southwell
that, after having ministered secretly
but zealously to the scattered
adherents of his creed, “without, as
far as is known, doing anything to
disturb the peace of society, he was
apprehended and committed to a
dungeon in the Tower, so noisome
and filthy that, when he was brought
out for examination, his clothes were
covered with vermin. Upon this his
father, a man of good family, presented
a petition to Queen Elizabeth,
begging that, if his son had committed
anything for which, by the laws, he
had deserved death, he might suffer
death; if not, as he was a gentleman,
he begged her majesty would be
pleased to order him to be treated as
a gentleman. Southwell after this
was somewhat better lodged, but an
imprisonment of three years, with ten
inflictions of the rack, wore out his
patience, and he entreated to be
brought to trial. Cecil is said to have
made the brutal remark that, ‘if he
was in so much haste to be hanged,
he should quickly have his desire.’
Being at the trial found guilty, upon
his own confession, of being a Romish
priest, he was condemned to death,
and executed at Tyburn accordingly,
with all the horrible circumstances
dictated by the old treason laws of
England. Throughout all these
scenes he behaved with a mild fortitude
which nothing but a highly
regulated mind and satisfied conscience
could have prompted.”</p>

<p>Cleveland (<i>Compendium of English
Literature</i>, p. 88), after stating the circumstances
of Southwell’s imprisonment,
trial, and execution, remarks:
“The whole proceeding should cover
the authors of it with everlasting
infamy. It is a foul stain upon
the garments of the maiden queen
that she can never wipe off. There
was not a particle of evidence at his
trial that this pious and accomplished
poet meditated any evil designs
against the government. He did
what he had a perfect right to do;
ay, what it was his duty to do, if he
conscientiously thought he was right&mdash;endeavor
to make converts to his
faith, so far as he could without interfering
with the right of others. If
there be anything to be execrated, it
is persecution for opinion’s sake.”</p>

<p>Allibone, in his <i>Dictionary of English
Literature</i>, says that Southwell,
“to the disgrace of the English government,
suffered as a martyr at Tyburn,
February 21, 1595, after three
years’ imprisonment in the Tower,
during which it is asserted he was
ten times subjected to the torture.
He was a good poet, a good prose
writer, and a better Christian than
his brutal persecutors.”</p>

<p>Old Fuller, in his <i>Worthies of England</i>,
as might be expected, views
Southwell with a stern English Protestant
eye, and thus dismisses him:
“Robert Southwell was born in this
county (Norfolk), as Pitsons affirmeth,
who, although often mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in his locality, may be believed
herein, as professing himself familiarly
acquainted with him at Rome.
But the matter is not much where he
was born, seeing, though cried up by
men of his own profession for his
many books in verse and prose, he
was reputed a dangerous enemy by
the state, for which he was imprisoned
and executed March the 3d,
1595” (vol. iii. p. 187).</p>

<p>Robert Southwell was the third
son of Richard Southwell, Esq., of
Horsham, St. Faith’s, Norfolk. The
curious in genealogy, while investigating
family lines associated with the
Southwell pedigree, have found connected
with it, in degrees more or
less near, the names of Paston, Sidney,
Howard, Newton, and Percy
Bysshe Shelley. Of his early years
there is but slight record, save that,
when still very young, he was sent to
Douai to be educated. From Douai
he passed to Paris and thence to
Rome, where, in 1578, before he had
yet reached the age of seventeen, he
was received into the order of the Society
of Jesus. On completion of his
novitiate and termination of the courses
of philosophy and theology, he was
made prefect of studies of the English
College at Rome. Ordained priest
in 1584, and, as appears from his letter
addressed, February 20, 1585, to the
general of the order, seeking the
“perilous” errand wherein his future
martyrdom seems rather to have been
anticipated than merely referred to as
a simple possibility,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> he left Rome
on the 8th of May, 1586, a missionary
to his native land, or, in other
words, took up his line of march for
the scaffold and for heaven. We
have, naturally enough, but scant record
of the young priest’s journey to
and arrival in England; for, as the
mere landing in England by a Catholic
priest was then a penal offence
punishable with death, Southwell’s
return to his native country was surrounded
as much as possible by secrecy.
Although yearning to visit his
home and embrace his family, he
carefully abstained from going near
them&mdash;of doing that which, in his
quaint phrase of the day, “maketh
my presence perilous.” But he was
aware that his father was in danger
of losing, if he had not already lost,
his faith; and these fears were
almost confirmed by the facts that he
had formed a marriage with a lady
of the court, and that his wealth
gave him entrance to court circles
which were necessarily violently Protestant.
Deeply solicitous for his
father’s spiritual condition, he therefore
addressed him a letter of admonition
and advice, not less remarkable
for its tone of affection than for its
energy and eloquence. We cite it
in another place.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">HUNTED DOWN.</p>

<p class="p1">At a time when, as Mr. Grosart
says, “it was a crime to be a Catholic:
it was proof of high treason to
be a priest: it was to invite ‘hunting’
as of a wild beast to be a
Jesuit,” we cannot reasonably look
for many recorded traces of Father
Southwell’s presence and journeyings
to and fro while in England. He
could only move in disguise or under
the darkness of night; he was liable to
be thrown into prison anywhere on
the merest suspicion of any irresponsible
accuser. The few Catholics
who were ready to give him shelter
and hospitality did so with the halter
around their necks; for confiscation
and death were the penalty, as they
well knew, for “harboring” a priest.
It is nevertheless certain that his
refuge in London was the mansion
of the Countess of Arundel, whose
husband, Philip Howard, Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Arundel, was imprisoned in the
Tower, and died there, the noblest
victim to the jealous and suspicious
tyranny of Elizabeth, <i>non sine veneni
suspicione</i>, as his epitaph still testifies.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Southwell’s letters to
his superiors still exist, but they are
all from necessity written in such
general terms and in so guarded a
manner as to afford but little historical
information. Here is one of
them, as given by Bishop Challoner
in his <i>Memoirs of Missionary Priests</i>:</p>

<p>1. “As yet we are alive and well,
being unworthy, it seems, of prisons.
We have oftener sent, than received,
letters from your parts, tho’ they are
not sent without difficulty; and some,
we know, have been lost.”</p>

<p>2. “The condition of Catholic recusants
here is the same as usual, deplorable
and full of fears and dangers,
more especially since our
adversaries have look’d for wars.
As many of ours as are in chains
rejoice and are comforted in their
prisons; and they that are at liberty
set not their heart upon it, nor expect
it to be of long continuance. All by
the great goodness and mercy of
God arm themselves to suffer anything
that can come, how hard soever
it may be, as it shall please our
Lord; for whose greater glory, and the
salvation of their souls, they are more
concerned than for any temporal
losses.”</p>

<p>3. “A little while ago, they apprehended
two priests, who have suffered
such cruel usages in the prison
of Bridewell as can scarce be
believed. What was given them to
eat was so little in quantity, and,
withal, so filthy and nauseous, that
the very sight was enough to turn
their stomachs. The labors to which
they obliged them were continual and
immoderate, and no less in sickness
than in health; for, with hard blows
and stripes, they forced them to accomplish
their task how weak soever they
were. Their beds were dirty straw,
and their prison most filthy. Some
are there hung up for whole days by
the hands, in such a manner that
they can but just touch the ground
with the tips of their toes. This purgatory
we are looking for every hour,
in which Topcliffe and Young, the
two executioners of the Catholics,
exercise all kinds of torments. But
come what pleaseth God, we hope
we shall be able to bear all in him
that strengthens us. I most humbly
recommend myself to the holy sacrifices
of your reverence and of all our
friends. (January 15, 1590.)”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">PURSUIT AND ESCAPE.</p>

<p class="p1">In a work<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> published so lately as
1871, we catch a few fugitive glances
of Father Robert Southwell. Father
Gerard spoke of him at the time
(1585) as “excelling in the art of
helping and gaining souls, being at
once prudent, pious, meek, and exceedingly
winning.”</p>

<p>A descent was made by the pursuivants
upon a house in the country,
where the two fathers happened to
be together, and but for the devotion
of the domestics the two missionaries
would have been captured.
They escaped, however, and journeyed
away together. The peculiar
danger they were then subjected to
was that arising from intercourse with
the gentry. Father Gerard tells of a
gentleman who violently suspected
him, and adds: “After a day or so he
quite abandoned all mistrust, as I
spoke of hunting and falconry with
all the details that none but a practised
person could command.” He
concludes: “For many make sad
blunders in attempting this, as Father
Southwell, who was afterwards my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
companion in many journeys, was
wont to complain. He frequently
got me to instruct him in the technical
terms of sport, and used to complain
of his bad memory for such
things; for on many occasions when
he fell in with Protestant gentlemen
he found it necessary to speak of
these matters, which are the sole
topics of their conversations, save
when they talk obscenity or break
out into blasphemies and abuse of
the saints or the Catholic faith.”</p>

<p>With danger of possible arrest at
every house and on every road, followed
by swift and barbarous execution,
Father Southwell for six long
years carried his life in his hand.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">PROTESTANT OPINION.</p>

<p class="p1">“Granted,” says his Protestant
biographer (Grosart, xlix.), “that in
our Southwell’s years 1588 is included,
and that the shadow of the
coming of the Armada lay across
England from the very moment of
his arrival; granted that, in the
teeth of their instructions, there were
priests and members of the Society
of Jesus who deemed they did God
service by ‘plotting’ for the restoration
of the old ‘faith and worship’
after a worldly sort; granted that politically
and civilly the nation was, in
a sense, in the throes of since-achieved
liberties; granted that <i>Mary</i>, all too
sadly, even tremendously, earned her
epithet of ‘Bloody’; granted that
the very mysticism, not to say
mystery, of the ‘higher’ sovereignty
claimed for him who wore the tiara,
acted as darkness does with sounds
the most innocent; granted nearly
all that Protestantism claims in its
apology as defence&mdash;it must be regarded
as a stigma on the statesmanship
and a stain on the Christianity
of the reformed Church of
England, as well as a sorrow to
all right-minded and right-hearted,
that the ‘convictions’ of those who
could not in conscience ‘change’ at
the bidding of Henry VIII., Elizabeth,
or James were not respected;
that ‘opinion,’ or, if you will, ‘error,’
was put down (or attempted to be
put down) by force, and that the
headsman’s axe and hangman’s rope
were the only instrumentalities
thought of. The State Trials remain
to bring a blush to every lover of
his country for the brutal and ‘hard’
mockery of justice in the higher
courts of law whenever a priest was
concerned&mdash;as later with the Puritans
and Nonconformists.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">FALSE BRETHREN AND THE MAN-HUNTER.</p>

<p class="p1">With malignant pursuit that never
slackened, and that old peril of S.
Paul, “false brethren,” Southwell’s
arrest was, of course, a mere question
of time. His day came at last,
after six years of labor and danger in
the field. The circumstances are as
follows, from Turnbull, verified by
other authorities. There was resident
at Uxenden, near Harrow on
the Hill, in Middlesex, a Catholic
family by the name of Bellamy, occasionally
visited by Southwell for the
purpose of religious instruction. One
of the daughters, Ann, had in her
early youth exhibited marks of the
most vivid and unshakable piety;
but having been committed to the
gatehouse of Westminster, her faith
gradually departed, and along with it
her virtue: for, having formed an
intrigue with the keeper of the prison,
she subsequently married him, and
by this step forfeited all claim which
she had by law or favor upon her
father. In order, therefore, to obtain
some fortune, she resolved to take
advantage of the act of 27 Elizabeth,
which made the harboring of a priest
treason, with confiscation of the offender’s
goods. Accordingly she sent
a messenger to Southwell, urging him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to meet her on a certain day and
hour at her father’s house; whither
he, either in ignorance of what had
happened, or under the impression
that she sought his spiritual assistance
through motives of penitence, went
at the appointed time. In the meanwhile,
having apprised her husband
of this, as also the place of concealment
in her father’s house and the
mode of access, he conveyed the information
to Topcliffe, an implacable
persecutor and denouncer of the Catholics,
who, with a band of his satellites,
surrounded the premises, broke
open the house, arrested his reverence,
and carried him off in open day, exposed
to the gaze of the populace.
Topcliffe carried Southwell to his own
(Topcliffe’s) dwelling, and there, in
the course of ten weeks, tortured him
with such pitiless severity that the
unhappy victim, complaining of it to
his judges, declared that death would
have been preferable. A letter, qualified
by Grosart as “fawning, cruel,
and abominable,” written by this human
bloodhound, Topcliffe, and addressed
to no less a personage than
Queen Elizabeth, reports the capture
and torture of Southwell, and states,
with details, how he proposes further
to torture him.</p>

<p>The letter is dated Westminster,
June 22, 1592, and advises the queen:
“I have him here within my strong
chamber in Westminster churchyard
(<i>i.e.</i> the gatehouse). I have made
him assured for starting or hurting of
himself by putting upon his arms a
pair of;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and so to
keep him either from view or conference
with any but Nicolas, the underkeeper
of the gatehouse....
Upon this present taking of him it is
good forthwith to enforce him to answer
truly and directly; and so to
prove his answers true in haste, to the
end that such as he be deeply concerned
in his treachery may not have
time to start, or make shift to use any
means in common prisons; either to
stand upon or against the wall will
give warning. <i>But if your highness’
pleasure be to know anything in his
heart, to stand against the wall, his
feet standing upon the ground, and his
hands put as high as he can reach
against the wall</i> (like a trick at Tremshemarn),
will enforce him to tell all;
and the truth proven by the sequel....<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
It may please your majesty
to consider, I never did take so
weighty a man, if he be rightly considered.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The reader will here readily recognize
a partial description of one of
the modes of torture then most common
in use throughout the reign of
Elizabeth. It seems that it <i>was</i> “her
highness’ pleasure” to know something
that was in this poor martyr’s
heart, for Southwell was afterwards
again repeatedly tortured. The intimate
personal relations existing between
the virgin queen and this man
Topcliffe, whose very name was a
stench in the nostrils of Protestants
of respectable behavior, were maintained
long after the Southwell capture,
as we learn from the best authority.
The cruelty of Elizabeth
was only surpassed by her mendacity,
as her mendacity was only exceeded
by her mean parsimony, and
when she travelled or made progress
from one country to another it was
always at the expense of her good
and loyal subjects. Eventually the
announcement of a visit from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
good queen, received outwardly with
such declarations as might naturally
follow the promise of the call of a
special envoy from heaven, was in
reality looked upon as the coming
of a terrible calamity. It was at that
time considered at the English court&mdash;where,
as we all know, all the civil
and religious virtues had taken refuge&mdash;an
excellent jest to so direct
the course of the queen’s progress as
to make her visits fall at the residences
of well-known Catholic gentlemen.
It is only necessary to say
that the anniversary of all such
events yet lives in the traditions of the
descendants of such families as that
of a day of horror. The royal retinue
treated the house like a captured
place, and it was well for the proprietor
if confiscation or death, or
both, were not the sole reward of his
generous hospitality.</p>

<p>Mr. Topcliffe gives us valuable information
on this point. On the
30th of August, 1578, he writes to the
Earl of Shrewsbury: “The next good
news (not in account the highest), her
majesty hath served God with great
zeal and comfortable examples; for
by her council the two notorious papists,
young Rookwood (the master of
Ewston Hall, where her majesty did
lie upon Sunday now a fortnight), and
one Downs, a gentleman, were both
committed, the one to the town prison
at Norwich, the other to the
county prison there, for obstinate
papistry; and seven more gentlemen
of worship were committed to several
houses in Norwich as prisoners; two
of the Lovells, another Downs, one
Benings, one Parry, and two others....
Her majesty, by some
means I know not, was lodged at his
(Rookwood’s) house, Ewston, far unmeet
for her highness, but fitter for
the blackguard; nevertheless her excellent
majesty gave to Rookwood
ordinary thanks for his bad house,
and her fair hand to kiss; after
which it was braved at. But my
lord chamberlain, nobly and gravely
understanding that Rookwood was
excommunicated for papistry, called
him before him, demanded of him
how he durst presume to attempt her
real presence, he, unfit to accompany
any Christian person; forthwith
said he was fitter for a pair of stocks;
commanded him out of the court,
and yet to attend her council’s pleasure;
and at Norwich he was committed,”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
etc. etc. In the beginning
of the letter Topcliffe “joys at her
majesty’s gracious favor and affiance
in your lordship&mdash;next some comfort
I received of her for myself that
must ever lie nearest my own heart.”
Tender Topcliffe! But we must
have “no scandal about Queen Elizabeth,”
and our most delicate susceptibilities
for the fair fame of the royal
virgin may be quieted by the certainty
that the comfort nearest the human
bloodhound’s “own heart” was
something substantial&mdash;a country
house, an estate, or the like.</p>

<p>Lodge says that this Topcliffe was
respectably connected, but that he
could only find that he was distinguished
as a most implacable persecutor
of Roman Catholics. In a letter
of Sir Anthony Standen, in which
he praises the agreeable manners of
the Earl of Essex, he writes: “Contrary
to our <i>Topcliffian</i> customs, he
hath won more with words than
others could do with racks.” From
another letter of the period it appears
that <i>Topcliffzare</i> in the quaint language
of the court signified to hunt
a recusant.</p>

<p>But to return to Southwell.
Transferred to a dungeon in the
Tower, “so noisome and filthy that,
when he was brought out at the
end of the month, his clothes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
covered with vermin,” his father
wrote to her majesty Queen Elizabeth
the letter we have already mentioned.
This petition was to some
extent regarded. A better lodging
was allowed him, and leave accorded
his father to supply him with “cloaths
and other necessaries”; and amongst
the rest, with books which he asked
for, which were only the Holy Bible
and the works of S. Bernard. “The
selection of books,” says Mr. Grosart,
“<i>the</i> book of books, and the father
of the fathers, for a poet is very noteworthy;
and through all his weary
imprisonment ‘spiritual things,’ not
civil or earthly, were his theme when
he discoursed to his sister Mary
(Mrs. Bannister) or others permitted
occasionally to visit him.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">TRIAL AND EXECUTION.</p>

<p class="p1">We adopt mainly the relation of
Southwell’s trial and execution as it
is given by Bishop Challoner, supported
by a Latin MS. preserved in
the archives of the English College
of S. Omer’s:</p>

<p>“After Father Southwell had been
kept close prisoner for three years in
the Tower, he sent an epistle to
Cecil, Lord Treasurer, humbly entreating
his lordship that he might
either be brought upon his trial to
answer for himself, or at least that
his friends might have leave to come
and see him. The treasurer answered
that, if he was in so much
haste to be hanged, he should quickly
have his desire. Shortly after this
orders were given that he should be
removed from the Tower to Newgate,
where he was put down into the dungeon
called <i>Limbo</i>, and there kept
for three days.</p>

<p>“On the 22d of February, without
any previous warning to prepare for
his trial, he was taken out of his dark
lodging and hurried to Westminster,
to hold up his hand there at the bar.
The first news of this step towards
his martyrdom filled his heart with a
joy which he could not conceal.
The judges before whom he was
to appear were Lord Chief-Justice
Popham, Justice Owen, Baron Evans,
and Sergeant Daniel. As soon
as Father Southwell was brought in,
the lord chief-justice made a long
and vehement speech against the
Jesuits and seminary priests, as the
authors and contrivers of all the
plots and treasons which, he pretended,
had been hatched during
that reign. Then was read the bill
of indictment against Father Southwell,
drawn up by Cook, the queen’s
solicitor.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">THEIR FAITH WAS THEIR GUILT.</p>

<p class="p1">It would be well to remark here
that Protestants nowadays frequently
contend that the missionary priests
judicially murdered during the reign
of Elizabeth were not executed on account
of their religion, but because
they were stirrers up of sedition and
traitors, and were in every case so
proven to be upon their respective
trials. The good people who set up
such pretext are sadly in ignorance
of the history of that dark period. So
far from asserting the slightest pretence
of guilt on the part of such acts
accused of as commonly constitute
sedition and high treason, the statute
of Elizabeth under which they were
sent to the gallows only made it
necessary to show that they were
Englishmen and Catholic priests, and
were arrested in England. The statute,
in fact, enacted substantially
that, “if any Jesuit, seminary priest,
or deacon, or religious or ecclesiastical
person whatever, born within the
realm, shall come into, be, or remain
in any part of this realm, every such
offence shall be taken and adjudged
to be high treason.” The indictment
against Southwell was “drawn up by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Cook, the queen’s solicitor,” says the
S. Omer MS. Now, “Cook, the
queen’s solicitor” here referred to
was no less a personage than the
great Coke. Here is the indictment
presented by him in Southwell’s case,
from which it will be seen that the
prisoner was charged only with the
crimes of, <i>first</i>, being a priest of English
birth; <i>second</i>, of having remained
in the county of Middlesex:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The jury present, on the part of our
sovereign lady the queen, that Robert
Southwell, late of London, clerk, born
within this kingdom of England; to wit,
since the feast of S. John the Baptist, in
the first year of the reign of her majesty,
and before the first day of May, in the
thirty-second year of the reign of our lady
the queen aforesaid, made and ordained
priest by authority derived and pretended
from the See of Rome; not having the
fear of God before his eyes, and slighting
the laws and statutes of this realm of
England, without any regard to the penalty
therein contained, on the 20th day of
June, the thirty-fourth year of the reign
of our lady the queen, at Uxenden, in the
county of Middlesex, traitorously, and as
a false traitor to our lady the queen, was
and remained, contrary to the form of the
statute in such case set forth and provided,
and contrary to the peace of our
said lady the queen, her crown, and dignities.”</p>

<p class="p1">The grand jury having found the
bill, Father Southwell was ordered to
come up to the bar. He readily
obeyed, and, bowing down his head,
made a low reverence to his judges;
then modestly held up his hand according
to custom, and, being asked
whether he was guilty or not guilty,
he answered, “I confess that I was
born in England, a subject to the
queen’s majesty, and that, by authority
derived from God, I have been
promoted to the sacred order of
priesthood in the Roman Church,
for which I return most hearty thanks
to his divine Majesty. I confess,
also, that I was at Uxenden, in Middlesex,
at that time, when, being sent
for thither by trick and deceit, I fell
into your hands, as is well known;
but that I never entertained any designs
or plots against the queen or
kingdom, I call God to witness, the
revenger of perjury; neither had I
any other design in returning home
to my native country than to administer
the sacraments according to the
rite of the Catholic Church to such
as desired them.”</p>

<p>Here the judge interrupted him,
and told him that he was to let all
that alone, and plead directly guilty
or not guilty. Upon which he said,
<i>he was not guilty of any treason whatsoever</i>.
And being asked by what he
would be tried, he said, “By God
and by you.” The judge told him
he was to answer, “By God and his
country,” which, at first, he refused,
alleging that the laws of his country
were disagreeable to the law of God,
and that he was unwilling these poor
harmless men of the jury, whom they
obliged to represent the country,
should have any share in their guilt,
or any hand in his death. “But,”
said he, “if through your iniquity it
must be so, and I cannot help it, be
it as you will; I am ready to be
judged by God and my country.”
When the twelve were to be sworn,
he challenged none of them, saying
that they were all equally strangers to
him, and therefore charity did not allow
him to except against any one of
them more than another.</p>

<p>After Coke had presented the case
to the jury, they went aside to consult
about the verdict, and in a short
time brought him in guilty. He was
asked if he had anything more to say
for himself why sentence should not
be pronounced against him? He
said: “Nothing; but from my heart I
beg of Almighty God to forgive all
who have been any ways accessory
to my death.” The judge having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pronounced sentence according to
the usual form, Father Southwell
made a very low bow, returning him
most hearty thanks as for an unspeakable
favor. The judge offered
him the help of a minister to prepare
him to die. Father Southwell desired
he would not trouble him upon that
head; that the grace of God would
be more than sufficient for him.
And so, being sent back to Newgate
through the streets, lined with people,
he discovered, all the way, the overflowing
joy of his heart in his eyes,
in his whole countenance, and in
every gesture and motion of his
body. He was again put down into
limbo, at his return to Newgate,
where he spent the following night,
the last of his life, in prayer, full of
the thoughts of the journey he was to
take the next day, through the gate
of martyrdom, into a happy eternity;
to enjoy for ever the sovereign object
of his love.</p>

<p>We have seen by what device and
with what ill success the officials directing
the execution sought, on
the next morning, to draw away the
crowd from Tyburn where Father
Southwell was to be “hung, bowelled,
and quartered.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">EXECUTIONS UNDER ELIZABETH.</p>

<p class="p1">The modern reader generally, and
very naturally, supposes that this sentence,
horrible as it is in its simplest
form, would be carried out as stated,
that is to say, that, when the condemned
man was hung until dead,
his body was then butchered as described.
This probably was the intention
of the law, and the latter two
of the three incidents of the executions
were intended more as indignities
to the remains of a criminal
supposed to be guilty of the greatest
of human crimes than as any part of
the means of procuring death. But
under the reign of Elizabeth the cruelty
and bestiality of the mode in
which the horrible sentence was carried
out had reached its height. As
a general thing, the victim was
butchered alive. According to the
whim or the bloodthirstiness of the
executioner, the condemned man was
allowed to hang a short time, or he
was scarcely swung off before he was
cut down and the hangman was&mdash;as
he is described in a well-known
phrase&mdash;“grabbling among his entrails.”
Sometimes the executioner
would spring upon the body as it
was swung off, and plunge his knife
into the victim before they reached
the ground in their fall together.
When a young priest named Edward
Genings was executed, in 1591, the
butchery was superintended by Topcliffe,
who adjured the victim to submit
and recant and he should be pardoned.
His reply was: “I know
not in what I have offended my dear
anointed princess; if I had, I would
willingly ask forgiveness. If she be
offended with me because I am a
priest, and because I profess my faith
and will not turn minister against my
conscience, I shall be, I trust, excused
and innocent before God. I
must obey God, saith S. Peter, rather
than men.” At this Topcliffe was enraged,
and bade the hangman turn
the ladder; scarcely giving him time
to say a <i>Pater Noster</i>. Cut down
by his order before he was dead, the
butchery began, and, the hangman’s
hand being already on his heart,
Genings was heard to say, “Sancte
Gregori, ora pro me!”&mdash;which the
hangman hearing, he swore, “<i>Zounds,
see, his heart is in my hand</i>, and yet
Gregory is in his mouth! O egregious
papist!”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>We return to Father Southwell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
who was drawn on a hurdle or sled
from Newgate to Tyburn, and resume
the account of the S. Omer’s
MS.: “When he was come to the
place, getting up into the cart, he
made the sign of the cross in the
best manner that he could, his hands
being pinion’d, and began to speak
to the people those words of the
apostle (Rom. xiv), ‘Whether we live,
we live to the Lord, or whether we
die, we die to the Lord; therefore,
whether we live or die, we belong to
the Lord.’ Here the sheriff would
have interrupted him, but he begged
leave that he might go on, assuring
him that he would utter nothing that
should give offence. Then he spoke
as follows: ‘I am come to this
place to finish my course, and to
pass out of this miserable life; and
I beg of my Lord Jesus Christ, in
whose most precious Passion and
Blood I place my hope of salvation,
that he would have mercy on my
soul. I confess I am a Catholic
priest of the Holy Roman Church,
and a religious man of the Society
of Jesus; on which account I owe
eternal thanks and praises to my
God and Saviour.’ Here he was
interrupted by a minister telling him
that, if he understood what he had
said in the sense of the Council of
Trent, it was damnable doctrine.
But the minister was silenc’d by the
standers-by, and Mr. Southwell went
on, saying: ‘Sir, I beg of you not
to be troublesome to me for this
short time that I have to live: I am
a Catholic, and in whatever manner
you may please to interpret my
words, I hope for my salvation by
the merits of Our Lord Jesus Christ;
and as to the queen, I never attempted,
nor contrived, or imagined
any evil against her, but have
always prayed for her to Our Lord,
and for this short time of my life
still pray, that, in his infinite mercy,
he would be pleased to give her all
such gifts and graces which he sees,
in his divine wisdom, to be most expedient
for the welfare both of her
soul and body, in this life and in the
next. I recommend in like manner,
to the same mercy of God, my poor
country, and I implore the divine
bounty to favor it with his light and
the knowledge of his truth, to the
greater advancement of the salvation
of souls, and the eternal glory of his
divine Majesty. In fine, I beg of
the almighty and everlasting God,
that this my death may be for my
own and for my country’s good, and
the comfort of the Catholics my
brethren.’</p>

<p>“Having finished these words, and
looking for the cart to be immediately
drove away, he again blessed himself,
and, with his eyes raised to heaven,
repeated with great calmness of mind
and countenance, ‘Into thy hands,
O Lord, I commend my spirit,’ with
other short ejaculations, till the cart
was drawn off. The unskilful hangman
had not applied the noose of
the rope to the proper place, so that
he several times made the sign of the
cross whilst he was hanging, and was
some time before he was strangled,
which some perceiving, drew him by
the legs to put an end to his pain, and
when the executioner was for cutting
the rope before he was dead, the
gentlemen and people that were
present cried out three several times,
‘Hold, hold!’ for the behavior of
the servant of God was so edifying
in these his last moments, that even
the Protestants who were present at
the execution were much affected
with the sight.” After he was dead
he was cut down and the remainder
of the sentence carried out. Turnbull
relates that “Lord Mountjoy
(Charles Blount), who happened to
be present, was so struck by the
martyr’s constancy that he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
‘May my soul be with this
man’s!’ and he assisted in restraining
those who would have cut the
rope while he was still in life.”</p>

<p>Father Southwell’s reverend and
Protestant biographer declares, in
concluding his relation of the execution:
“I must regard our worthy as
a ‘martyr’ in the deepest and grandest
sense&mdash;a good man, and full of
the Holy Ghost. I should blush for
my Protestantism if I did not hold
in honor, yea reverence, his stainless
and beautiful memory.</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Through this desert, day by day,<br />
Wandered not his steps astray,<br />
Treading still the royal way.’</p>

<p class="pr6">&mdash;<i>Paradisus Animæ.</i></p>

<p class="p1">“So perished Father Southwell, at
thirty-three years of age, and so, unhappily,
have perished many of the
wise and virtuous of the earth. Conscious
of suffering in the supposed
best of causes, he seems to have met
death without terror&mdash;to have received
the crown of martyrdom not
only with resignation, but with joy.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It is matter of regret that there exists
no authentic portrait of Southwell.
His biographer is of opinion
that a genuine likeness of him would
have shown an intellectual, etherealized
face, and fancies that he might
have sat for the portrait of the Prior
in <i>The Lady of Garaye</i>:</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Tender his words, and eloquently wise;<br />
Mild the pure fervor of his watchful eyes;<br />
Meek with serenity and constant prayer,<br />
The luminous forehead, high and broad and bare.<br />
The thin mouth, though not passionless, yet still<br />
With a sweet calm that speaks an angel’s will.<br />
Resolving service to his God’s behest,<br />
And ever musing how to serve <i>him</i> best,<br />
Not old, nor young; with manhood’s gentlest grace,<br />
Pale to transparency the pensive face,<br />
Pale not with sickness but with studious thought,<br />
The body tasked, the fine mind overwrought;<br />
With something faint and fragile in the whole,<br />
As though ‘twere but a lamp to hold a soul.”</p>

<p class="pc4 mid">PART SECOND.&mdash;POET.</p>

<p class="p1">And here, first, a few words on the
prose writings of Southwell. We
have already referred to the remarkable
letter of admonition by him addressed
to his father. It is a severe
test to put the prose of any cultivated
language to that of comparison with
the productions of the same tongue
nearly three centuries later. And
yet this letter will support such comparison
surprisingly well both as to
substance and style. The reader
will bear in mind the peculiar circumstances
under which Southwell
addressed this</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">LETTER TO HIS FATHER.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I am not of so unnatural a kind, of so
wild an education, or so unchristian a
spirit, as not to remember the root out of
which I have branched, or to forget my
secondary maker and author of my being.
It is not the carelessness of a cold affection,
nor the want of a due and reverent
respect, that has made me such a stranger
to my native home, and so backward in
defraying the debt of a thankful mind, but
only the iniquity of these days that maketh
my presence perilous, and the discharge
of my duties an occasion of danger. I
was loath to enforce an unwilling courtesy
upon any, or by seeming officious to become
offensive; deeming it better to let
time digest the fear that my return into
the realm had bred in my kindred than
abruptly to intrude myself, and to purchase
their danger, whose good-will I so
highly esteem. I never doubted but what
the belief, which to all my friends by descent
and pedigree is, in a manner,
hereditary, framed in them a right persuasion
of my present calling, not suffering
them to measure their censures of me by
the ugly terms and odious epithets wherewith
heresy hath sought to discredit my
functions, but rather by the reverence of
so worthy a sacrament and the sacred
usages of all former ages. Yet, because
I might easily perceive by apparent conjectures
that many were more willing to
hear of me than from me, and readier to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
praise than to use my endeavors, I have
hitherto bridled my desire to see them by
the care and jealousy of their safety; and
banished myself from the scene of my
cradle in my own country. I have lived
like a foreigner, finding among strangers
that which, in my nearest blood, I presumed
not to seek.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then, regretting that he has
been barred from affording to his
dearest friends that which hath been
eagerly sought and beneficially
attained by mere strangers, he exclaims
passionately:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Who hath more interest in the grape
than he who planted the vine? Who
more right to the crop than he who sowed
the corn? or where can the child owe so
great service as to him to whom he is indebted
for his very life and being? With
young Tobias I have travelled far, and
brought home a freight of spiritual sustenance
to enrich you, and medicinable receipts
against your ghostly maladies. I
have with Esau, after long toil in pursuing
a long and painful chase, returned
with the full prey you were wont to love,
desiring thereby to ensure your blessing.
I have, in this general famine of all true
and Christian food, with Joseph prepared
abundance of the mead of angels for the
repast of your soul. And now my desire
is that my drugs may cure you, my prey
delight you, and my provisions feed you,
by whom I have been cured, enlightened,
and fed myself; that your courtesies may,
in part, be counterveiled, and my duty, in
some sort, performed.</p>

<p>“Despise not, good sire, the youth of
your son, neither deem your God measureth
his endowments by number of
years. Hoary senses are often couched
under youthful locks, and some are riper
in the spring than others in the autumn
of their age. God chose not Esau himself,
nor his eldest son, but young David,
to conquer Goliath and to rule his people;
not the most aged person, but David, the
most innocent youth, delivered Susannah
from the iniquity of the judges. Christ,
at twelve years of age, was found in the
temple questioning with the greatest doctors.
A true Elias can conceive that
a little cloud may cast a large and abundant
shower; and the Scripture teacheth
us that God unveileth to little ones that
which he concealeth from the wisest
sages. His truth is not abashed by the
minority of the speaker; for out of the
mouths of infants and sucklings he can
perfect his praises.... The full of
your spring-tide is now fallen, and the
stream of your life waneth to a low ebb;
your tired bark beginneth to leak, and
<i>grateth oft upon the gravel of the grave</i>;
therefore it is high time for you to strike
sail and put into harbor, lest, remaining
in the scope of the winds and waves of
this wicked time, some unexpected gust
should dash you upon the rock of eternal
ruin.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The entire letter is given in both
Walter and Turnbull’s <i>Memoirs of
Southwell</i>, and has been extravagantly
praised as being the composition
of Sir Walter Raleigh, among whose
<i>Remains</i> it is frequently reprinted.
Mr. Grosart, a Protestant clergyman,
says of it: “I know nothing comparable
with the mingled affection and
prophetlike fidelity, the wise instruction,
correction, reproof, the full rich
scripturalness and quaint applications,
the devoutness, the insistence,
the pathos of this letter.” The edition
of Sir Walter Raleigh’s <i>Remains</i>,
published in London in 1675, was
the subject of an article in the <i>Retrospective
Review</i> for 1820, in which the
reviewer remarks: “‘The Dutiful
Advice of a Loving Son to his Aged
Father’ is supposed to be a libel on
Sir Walter, written by his enemies.
It will be seen, however, that it bears
a strong resemblance to his style,
although the metaphor is more profuse
and ornamental, and seems to
be rather engrafted on his thoughts
than to spring up with them. That
this piece should be dictated by personal
hostility is strange. It contains
exhortations that might with the greatest
propriety be directed to any man.</p>

<p>“It is possible that it might be written
by another in imitation of Sir
Walter Raleigh’s ‘Advice to his Son’;
<i>yet if he was an enemy, he was of a
most uncommon description</i>. As the
advice, however, is worth quoting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
its own merit, and is written with
great force and beauty, we shall give
our readers an opportunity of judging
for themselves.”</p>

<p>This letter is Southwell’s earliest
dated prose, and was followed by a
variety of treatises, epistles, and pamphlets,
printed on the “private press”
at his own house in London. Besides
these, there remain several English
and a large number of Latin prose
writings still in manuscript. “Mary
Magdalene’s Funerall Teares,” although
prose in form, is in fact far
more fervid and impassioned than the
greater part of his poetry.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">SOUTHWELL’S POETRY.</p>

<p class="p1">To the readers of poetry for its
merely sensuous qualities of flowing
measure, attractive imagery, and brilliant
description, the poems of Southwell
possess but few attractions. Their
subjects are all religious, or, at least,
serious; and, in reading him, we must
totally forget the traditional pagan
poet pictured to us as crowned with
flowers, and holding in hand an
overflowing anacreontic cup. Serious,
indeed, his poems might well be,
for they were all composed during the
intervals of thirteen bodily rackings
in a gloomy prison that opened only
upon the scaffold. And yet we look
in vain among them for expressions
of the reproaches or repining such a
fate might well engender, and we
search with but scant result for record
or trace of his own sufferings in the
lines traced with fingers yet bent and
smarting with the rack. The vanity
of all earthly things, the trials of life,
the folly and wickedness of the world,
the uncertainty of life, and the consolations
and glories of religion, are the
constantly returning subjects of his
productions, and, however treated,
they always reflect the benignity and
elevation of the poet’s character.</p>

<p>Certain it is that Southwell was
largely read by the generation that
immediately succeeded him. Many
years ago, Ellis<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> said: “The very few
copies of his works which are now
known to exist are the remnant of at
least seventeen different editions, of
which eleven were printed between
1593 and 1600”; and at a later period,
Drake, in his <i>Shakespeare and
his Times</i>, says:<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> “Both the poetry
and the prose of Southwell possess
the most decided merit; the former,
which is almost entirely restricted to
moral and religious subjects, flows in
a vein of great harmony, perspicuity,
and elegance, and breathes a fascination
resulting from the subject and
the pathetic mode of treating it
which fixes and deeply interests the
reader.”</p>

<p>A valuable tribute of admiration
to Southwell’s poetic talent is that
of Ben Jonson, who said: “that
Southwell was hanged; yet so he
(Jonson) had written that piece of
his, ‘The Burning Babe,’ he would
have been content to destroy many of
his.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Our readers, we are sure, will
thank us for giving it here, although
we strongly suspect that Mr. Grosart
will not approve of its modern orthography.</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">As I in hoary winter’s night stood shivering in the snow,<br />
Surprised I was with sudden heat, which made my heart to glow;<br />
And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,<br />

<p class="p1">Our limits will permit but slight
citation from the body of Southwell’s
poetry. He is most widely known
by his chief poem “S. Peter’s Complaint,”
consisting of one hundred and
thirty-six stanzas (six-line). But his
most attractive pieces are his shorter
poems&mdash;“Times go by Turns,” “Content
and Rich,”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> “Life is but Loss,”
“Look Home,” “Love’s servile Lot,”
and the whole series on our Saviour
and his Mother; and, making some
allowance for the enthusiasm of our
editor, no true lover of poetry who
reads these productions of Southwell
will seriously dissent from Mr. Grosart’s
estimate of them. “The hastiest
reader will come on ‘thinking’
and ‘feeling’ that are as musical as
Apollo’s lute, and as fresh as a spring
budding spray; and the wording of
all (excepting over-alliteration and
inversion occasionally), is throughout
of the ‘pure well of English undefiled.’
When you take some of the
Myrtæ and Mæoniæ pieces, and read
and re-read them, you are struck
with their condensation, their concinnity,
their polish, their <i>élan</i>, their
memorableness. Holiness is in them
not as scent on love-locks, but as
fragrance in the great Gardener’s
flowers of fragrance. His tears are
pure and white as the ‘dew of the
morning.’ His smiles&mdash;for he has
humor, even wit, that must have
lurked in the burdened eyes and
corners o’ mouth&mdash;are sunny as sunshine.
As a whole, his poetry is
healthy and strong, and, I think, has
been more potential in our literature
than appears on the surface. I do
not think it would be hard to show
that others of whom more is heard
drew light from him, as well early as
more recent, from Burns to Thomas
Hood. For example, limiting as to
the latter, I believe every reader who
will compare the two deliberately
will see in the ‘Vale of Tears’ the
source of the latter’s immortal
‘Haunted House’&mdash;dim, faint, weak
beside it, as the earth-hid bulb compared
with the lovely blossom of
hyacinth or tulip or lily, nevertheless
really carrying in it the original of
the mightier after-poem.”</p>

<p>Our warmest tribute of praise can
render but scant justice to the intelligence,
the industry, the erudition,
the keen poetic sense, and the enthusiasm
which the editor of the volume
before us has devoted to what has
evidently been to him a labor of love.
Mr. Grosart is well known in the
literary world as the editor of Crashawe
and of Vaughan, as also of
the forthcoming editions of Marvell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Donne, and Sidney. His laboriously
corrected version of our martyr-poet’s
legacy has, it may be said, restored
Southwell to us, so obscured had he
become by mistakes, misprints, and
false readings. Indeed Mr. Grosart’s
somewhat jealous love of his subject
betrays him into apparently harsh
judgment on the efforts of others,
when, for instance, he declares himself
“vexed by the travesties on editing
and mere carelessness of Walter
earlier (1817) and Turnbull later
(1856) in their so-called editions of
the poems of Father Southwell,” adding:
“Turnbull said contemptuously,
‘I refrain from criticism on Mr.
Walter’s text’&mdash;severe but not undeserved,
only his own is scarcely
one whit better, and in places worse.”</p>

<p>There is one passage at the close
of Mr. Grosart’s interesting preface
which has a special interest for us
as Americans. We mean his reference
to the verdict pronounced on
Father Southwell’s poetry by Prof.
James Russell Lowell in his charming
book <i>My Study Windows</i>. “It
seems to me,” says Mr. Grosart,
“harsh to brutality on the man (meet
follower of him ‘the first true gentleman
that ever breathed’); while on
the poetry it rests on self-evidently
the most superficial acquaintance and
the hastiest generalization. To pronounce
‘S. Peter’s Complaint’ a
‘drawl’ of thirty pages of ‘maudlin
repentance, in which the distinctions
between the north and northeast
sides of a (<i>sic</i>) sentimentality are
worthy of Duns Scotus,’ shows about
as much knowledge&mdash;that is, ignorance&mdash;of
the poem as of the schoolman,
and as another remark does of
S. Peter; for, with admitted tedium,
S. Peter’s complaint sounds depths
of penitence and remorse, and utters
out emotion that flames into passion
very unforgettably, while there are
felicities of metaphor, daintinesses of
word-painting, brilliancies of inner-portraiture,
scarcely to be matched in
contemporary verse. The ‘paraphrase’
of David (to wit, ‘David’s
Peccavi’) is a single short piece, and
the ‘punning’ conceit, ‘fears are my
feres,’ is common to some of England’s
finest wits, and in the meaning
of ‘fere’ not at all to be pronounced
against. If we on this side
of the Atlantic valued less the opinion
of such a unique genius as Prof.
Lowell’s, if we did not take him
to our innermost love, we should less
grieve over such a vulgar affront offered
to a venerable name as his
whole paragraph to Southwell. I
shall indulge the hope of our edition
reaching the ‘Study,’ and persuading
to a real ‘study’ of these poems,
and, if so, I do not despair of a voluntary
reversal of the first judgment.”</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">ARIS WILMOTT</p>

<p class="pn1">pronounced Southwell to be the Goldsmith
of our early poets; and ‘Content
and Rich,’ and, ‘Dyer’s phansie
turned to a Sinner’s Complaint’
warrant the great praise. But beneath
the manner recalling Goldsmith,
there is a purity and richness
of thought, a naturalness, a fineness
of expression, a harmony of versification,
and occasionally a tide-flow of
high-toned feeling, not to be met
with in him.</p>

<p>“Nor will Prof. Lowell deem his
(I fear) hasty (mis)judgment’s reconsideration
too much to count on,
after the present Archbishop of Dublin’s
well-weighed words in his notes
to his <i>Household Book of English
Poetry</i> (1868):</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘Hallam thinks that Southwell has
been of late praised at least as much as
he deserves. This may be so; yet, taking
into account the finished beauty of
such poems as this (“Lewd Love is
Loss”) and No. 2 (“Times go by Turns”)
of this collection, poems which, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they go, leave nothing to be desired, he
has scarcely been praised more than he
deserves. How in earlier times he was
rated, the fact that there were twenty-four
editions of his poems will sufficiently testify;
though probably the creed be professed,
and the death which he died, may
have had something to do with this.
Robert Southwell was a seminary priest,
and was executed at Tyburn in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, in conformity with a
law, which even the persistent plottings
of too many of these at once against the
life of the sovereign and the life of the
state must altogether fail to justify or excuse’
(pp. 391-392).</p>

<p class="p1">“To Archbishop Trench’s I add,
as equally weighty and worthy, the
fine and finely sympathetic yet discriminative
judgment of Dr. George
Macdonald in <i>Antiphon</i> as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘I proceed to call up one <span class="smcap">WHO WAS A
POET INDEED</span>, although little known as
such, being a Roman Catholic, a Jesuit
even, and therefore, in Elizabeth’s reign,
a traitor and subject to the penalties according
(accruing)? Robert Southwell,
thirteen times most cruelly tortured,
could “not be induced to confess anything,
not even the color of the horse
whereon he rode on a certain day, lest
from such indication his adversaries might
conjecture in what house, or in company
of what Catholics, he that day was,’ etc.</p>

<p class="p1">“I believe, then,” concludes Dr.
Grosart, “I shall not appeal in vain
to Prof. Lowell to give a few hours
behind his ‘Study Windows’ to a reperusal
of some of the poems of
Southwell named by us and these
sufficiently qualified critics.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c56" id="c56">SOMETHING ABOUT LACE.</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is probably no article, not
a necessity, which has employed so
many heads and hands, and been the
subject of such varied interests, as
lace. The making of it has given
employment to countless nunneries,
where the ladies, working first and
most heartily for the church, have
also taught this art to their pupils as
an accomplishment or a means of
support. It was, indeed, so peculiarly
the province of the religious
that, long after it was done in the
world, it still bore the name of
“nun’s-work.”</p>

<p>In those old days when railroads
were not, and when swamps and
forests covered tracts of land now
thick with villages and cities, country
ladies made fine needle-work their
chief occupation; and it was the
custom in feudal times for the squires’
daughters to spend some time in the
castle, in attendance on the <i>châtelaine</i>,
where they learned to embroider and
make lace. It was then a woman’s
only resource, and was held in high
esteem. In the cloisters of Westminster
Abbey, one Catherine Sloper
was laid to rest, in 1620, with the
inscription on her tombstone that
she was “exquisite at her needle.”</p>

<p>Millions of poor women, and even
men and children, have earned their
bread by this delicate labor; women
of intelligence and fair estate have
devoted their lives to it; and noble
and regal ladies have been proud to
excel in the art.</p>

<p>It is related that when Cardinals
Wolsey and Campeggio went down
to the palace at Bridewell to seek an
interview with the repudiated wife of
Henry VIII., they found her seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
among her ladies embroidering, and
she came to meet them with a skein
of red silk around her neck. In those
days they wrought and made lace
with colored silk. We can imagine
how the bright floss must have trembled
over the tumultuous beatings of
that wronged heart during the cruel
interview that followed.</p>

<p>But the work of Catherine of
Aragon was not for vanity’s sake, nor
even to pass the heavy hours. In
her native Spain the rarest laces were
made for the church, and not only
nuns, but ladies of the world, wove
pious thoughts in with that fairy web.
Perhaps nowhere else, save in
Rome, was the church lace so rich
as in Spain. Images of favorite
saints and Madonnas had wardrobes
of regal magnificence, changed every
day, and the altars and vestments
were no less regally adorned.</p>

<p>Beckford writes that, in 1787,
the Marchioness of Cogalhudo, wife
of the eldest son of the semi-regal
race of Medina Cœli, was appointed
Mistress of the Robes to Our Lady of
La Solidad, in Madrid, and that the
office was much coveted.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the peasantry
of Bedfordshire, in England, first
learned lace-making through the
charity of Queen Catherine. While
at Ampthill, it is recorded that, when
not at her devotions, she, with her
ladies, “wrought a needle-work
costly and artificially, which she
intended for the honor of God to
bestow on some of the churches.”</p>

<p>The country people had the greatest
love and respect for the disgraced
queen; and, till lately, the lace-makers
held “Cattern’s Day,” the 25th of
November, as the holiday of their
craft, “in memory of good Queen
Catherine, who, when trade was dull,
burnt all her laces, and ordered new
to be made. The ladies of the court
followed her example, and the fabric
once more revived.” Lace was and
is considered a suitable present from
a king to a pontiff. These earlier
gifts were, it is true, sometimes of
gold and silver lace wrought with
precious stones, but they were
scarcely more costly than the later
white-thread points. In the Exhibition
of 1859 was shown a dress
valued at 200,000 francs, the
most costly work ever executed at
Alençon. This Napoleon III. purchased
for the empress, who, it is
said, presented it to his Holiness the
Pope as a trimming for his rochet.
Also, so early as the XIIIth century,
the English cut-work was so
fine that, according to Matthew
Paris, Pope Innocent IV. sent official
letters to some of the Cistercian
abbots of England to procure a
certain quantity of those vestments
for his own use. His Holiness had
seen and admired the orfrays of the
English clergy.</p>

<p>The finest specimens extant of this
old English work (<i>opus Anglicanum</i>)
are the cope and maniple of S. Cuthbert,
taken from his coffin many
years ago in the cathedral of Durham,
and now preserved in the chapter
library of that city. One who has
seen them declares them beautiful
beyond description.</p>

<p>This work seems to have been at
first used only for ecclesiastical purposes,
and the making of it to have
been a secret preserved in the monasteries.</p>

<p>Nor have the clergy been merely
the wearers of lace. We hear of
monks being praised for their skill
in “imbrothering”; and S. Dunstan
himself did not disdain to design patterns
for church lace. Pattern-books
for these needle-laces were made by
monks as well as laymen, and plates
in them represent men seated at the
embroidering frame. Some of these
old pattern books of the XVIth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
are preserved in the library of
S. Geneviève at Paris, inherited from
the monastery of that name. These
books are prized and sought for as
some of the earliest specimens of
block-printing. But few remain, and
doubtless their high price prevented
them from being made in great numbers.
Their place was taken by
samplers, into which were copied the
patterns desired. From these old lace-samplers
come the later alphabetical
samplers, which many now living will
remember to have made in their
youth.</p>

<p>Large quantities of rich old lace
were lost in the last century, when
the French Revolution brought in
gauzes and blondes, and fashion tossed
aside as worthless these exquisite
products of the needle. In Italy,
where the custom was to preserve old
family lace, less was destroyed; but
in England it was handed over to servants
or farm people, or stowed away
in attics, and afterwards burned.
Some ladies gave point-laces which
now they could not afford to buy, to
their children to dress their dolls
with. Sometimes it was thrown away
as old rags.</p>

<p>In the church, however, fashion
had no power, and old lace has been
usually preserved. Some collections
are exceedingly valuable. Notable
among these is that of the Rohan family,
who gave princes-archbishops
to Strasbourg. Baroness de Oberkirck,
in <i>Memoirs of the Court of Louis
XVI.</i>, writes: “We met the cardinal
coming out of his chapel dressed in
a soutane of scarlet moire and rochet
of inestimable value. When, on great
occasions, he officiates at Versailles,
he wears an alb of old lace of needlepoint
of such beauty that his assistants
were almost afraid to touch it.
His arms and device are worked in
a medallion above the large flowers.”
This alb is estimated at 100,000 livres.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the
extent to which lace was used prior
to the French Revolution, or the immense
extravagance of the sums
spent on it. Everybody wore it, even
servants emulating their masters and
mistresses. It trimmed everything,
from the towering Fontanges, which
rose like a steeple from ladies’ heads,
to the boot-tops and shoe-rosettes of
men. Men wore lace ruffles not only
at the wrist, but at the knee, lace
ruffs, cravats, collars, and garters;
and bed furniture was made of lace,
or trimmed with it, costly as it was.
A pair of ruffles would amount to
4,000 livres, a lady’s cap to 1,200
livres. We read that Mme. du Barry
gave 487 francs for lace enough to
trim a pillow-case, and 77 livres for
a pair of ruffles. Lace fans were
made in 1668, and lace-trimmed bouquet-holders
are not a new fancy.
When the Doge of Venice made his
annual visit to the convent <i>Delle Vergini</i>,
the lady abbess used to meet
him in the parlor, surrounded by her
novices, and present him a nosegay
in a gold handle trimmed with the
richest lace that could be found in
Venice.</p>

<p>Voltaire says that the mysterious
Iron Mask was passionately fond of
fine linen and rich lace.</p>

<p>So extravagant had the use of this
luxury become that in England there
was an outcry against it, and the Puritans
laid great stress on discarding
vanity in clothing.</p>

<p>We have a little scene illustrative,
between the Princess Mary and Lady
Jane Grey. The princess had given
the maiden some gorgeous dresses
trimmed with lace. “What shall
I do with it?” asks Lady Jane.
“Gentlewoman, wear it,” was the
reply, a little vexed, may be. “Nay,”
says Lady Jane, “that were a shame
to follow my Lady Mary against
God’s will, and leave my Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Elizabeth, which followeth God’s
will.”</p>

<p>“My Lady Elizabeth,” however,
set aside her scruples before long,
and, when queen, did not hesitate to
adorn herself as bravely as she might,
though she had no mind her fashions
should be copied by the vulgar; for
we read that, when the London Apprentices
adopted white stitching and
guards as ornaments for their collars,
Queen Elizabeth forbade it, and
ordered that the first transgressor
should be publicly whipped in the
hall of his company.</p>

<p>There is another incident, which,
as one of the sex in whom vanity is
supposed to be prominent, we take
special pleasure in relating.</p>

<p>The Puritan nobles had not in dress
conformed to Puritan rules as strictly
as some desired, the foreign ambassadors
dressing as richly as ever.
When, therefore, the Spanish envoy
accredited to the Protectorate of
Cromwell arrived and was about to
have an audience, Harrison begged
Lord Warwick and Colonel Hutchinson
to set an example by not wearing
either gold or silver lace. These
gentlemen did not disapprove of rich
clothing, but, rather than give offence,
they and their associates appeared
the next day in plain black suits.
But, to their astonishment, Harrison
entered dressed in a scarlet coat so
covered with lace and <i>clinquant</i> as
to hide the material of which it was
made. Whereupon Mrs. Hutchinson
remarks that Harrison’s “godly
speeches were only made that he
might appear braver above the rest in
the eyes of the strangers.”</p>

<p>Lace has frequently employed the
thoughts of law-makers, and in 1698
was the subject of a legislative duel
between England and Flanders.
There was already in England an
act prohibiting the importation of
bone-lace (<i>i.e.</i> bobbin-lace), loom-lace,
cut-work, and needle-work
point; but this proving ineffectual,
since everybody smuggled, another
act was passed setting a penalty of
twenty shillings a yard and forfeiture.
We regret to learn that forfeiture
meant, in some cases at least, burning,
and that large quantities of the
finest Flanders lace were seized and
actually burned. It reminds one of
the burning of Don Quixote’s library
of chivalric records.</p>

<p>Flanders, however, with its nunneries
full of lace-makers, and its thousands
of people depending on the
trade, had no mind to be thus crippled
without retaliation. An act was
immediately passed prohibiting the
importation of English wool; whereupon
the wool-staplers echoed with
addition the groans of the lace-makers,
and England was forced to repeal
the act so far as the Low Countries
were concerned.</p>

<p>As we have said, everybody in
England smuggled lace in those
days. Smuggling seems indeed to be
everywhere looked on as the least
shameful of law-breaking. But never,
perhaps, were officers of the customs
as incorruptible as these. Suspicious
persons were searched, no matter
what their rank, and no person living
within miles of a seaport dared to
wear a bit of foreign lace unless they
could prove that it had been honestly
obtained. Many were the devices
by which men and women sought to
elude the customs. When a deceased
clergyman of the English Church
was conveyed home from the Low
Countries for burial, it was found that
only his head, hands, and feet were
in the coffin&mdash;the body had been replaced
by Flanders lace of immense
value. Years after, when the body
of his Grace the Duke of Devonshire,
who had died in France, was brought
over, the custom-house officers not
only searched the coffin, but poked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the corpse with a stick to make sure
that it was a body. The High Sheriff
of Westminster was more fortunate,
for he succeeded in smuggling £6,000
worth of lace in the coffin that
brought over from Calais the body of
Bishop Atterbury.</p>

<p>In the present century, Lady Ellenborough,
wife of the lord chief-justice,
was stopped near Dover, and a
large quantity of valuable lace found
secreted in the lining of her carriage.</p>

<p>At one period, much lace was
smuggled into France from Belgium
by means of dogs trained for the
purpose. A dog was caressed and
petted at home, then, after a while,
sent across the frontier, where he was
tied up, starved, and ill-treated. The
skin of a larger dog was then fitted
to his body, the intervening space
filled with lace, and the poor animal
was released. Of course he made
haste to scamper back to his former
home.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> of the customs, there is a
story in which George III. had an
active part, and displayed his determination
to protect home manufactures.</p>

<p>On the marriage of his sister,
Princess Augusta, to the Duke of
Brunswick, the king ordered that all
stuffs and laces worn should be of
English manufacture. The nobility,
intent on outshining each other on this
grand occasion, took but little notice
of the command. We may well believe
that the rooms of the court milliner
were gorgeous with these preparations;
that there was unusual hurry
and flurry lest everything should not
be done in time; and that high-born
and beautiful ladies were constantly
besieging the doors, bringing additions
to the stock. Fancy, then, the
consternation of the expectant and
excited dames, when, only three days
before the wedding, the customs
made a descent on this costly finery,
and carried off in one fell swoop
the silver, the gold, and the laces!
There was not only the loss of these
dear gewgaws to mourn, but a new
toilet to be prepared in three days!</p>

<p>The camp, too, as well as the
church and the court, has cherished
lace, and the warriors of those days
did not fight less gallantly because
they went into battle elegantly arrayed.
Lace ruffles at the wrist did
not weaken the sword or sabre stroke,
nor laces on the neck and bosom
make faint the heart beneath. Possibly
they helped to a nobler courtesy
and a braver death; for slovenly
dress tends to make slovenly manners,
and slovenly manners often
lead to careless morals.</p>

<p>A graceful fashion called the Steinkerk
had a martial origin, and was
named from the battle so-called,
wherein Marshal Luxembourg won
the day against William of Orange.
On that day, the young princes of
the blood were suddenly and unexpectedly
called into battle. Hastily
knotting about their necks the laced
cravats then in fashion, and usually
tied with great nicety, they rushed
into action, and won the fight.</p>

<p>In honor of that event, both ladies
and gentlemen wore their cravats
and scarfs loosely twisted and knotted,
the ends sometimes tucked through
the button-hole, sometimes confined
by a large oval-shaped brooch; and
Steinkerks became the rage.</p>

<p>But evidence enough, perhaps, has
been brought to prove that lace is not
an entirely trivial subject of discourse.
We may, however, add that
Dr. Johnson condescended to define
net lace in his most Johnsonian manner.
It is, he says, “anything reticulated
or decussated, with interstices
between the intersections.” After
that, ladies may wear their ruffles not
only with pleasure, but with respect;
for if he was so learned in defining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
plain net, what unimaginable erudition
would have entered his definition
of Honiton guipure, or the points of
Alençon, Brussels, or Venice!</p>

<p>Spiders were probably the first
creatures that made lace, though the
trees held a delicate white network
under the green of their leaves.
After the spiders came the human
race, following closely. Old Egyptian
pictures and sculptures show us
women engaged in twisting threads;
and the Scriptures are full of allusions
to “fine twined linen” and needle-work.
Almost as soon as garments
were worn they began to be adorned
at the edges; and among savages, to
whom garments were of slight consequence,
tattooing was practised,
which is the same idea in a different
form.</p>

<p>The Israelites probably learned
from the Egyptians, and from them
the art travelled westward. One
theory is that Europe learned it from
the Saracens. It matters but little to
us which is the real version. It is
most likely that all the children of
Adam and Eve had some fancy of
this sort which reached greater perfection
in the more cultivated tribes
and nations, and was by them taught
to the others. The waved or serrated
edges of leaves would suggest
such adornments to them, or the fur
hanging over the edge of the rude
skins they wore. The very waves of
the sea, that curled over in snowy
spray at their tips, had a suggestion
of lace and ornamental bordering;
and the clouds of sunrise and sunset
were fringed with crimson and gold
by the sun. Flower petals were finished
with a variegated edge, and it
was not enough that birds had wings,
but they must be ornamented.</p>

<p>When embroidery at length became
an art, the Phrygian women
excelled all others. Presently close
embroidery became open-worked or
cut-worked, and out of cut-work grew
lace.</p>

<p>This cut-work was made in various
ways. In one kind, a network
of thread was made on a frame, and
under this was gummed a piece of
fine cloth. Then those parts which
were to remain thick were sewed
round on to the cloth; and afterward
the superfluous cloth was cut
away.</p>

<p>Another kind was made entirely of
thread, which was arranged on a
frame in lines diverging from the
centre like a spider’s web, and
worked across and over with other
threads, forming geometrical patterns.
Later, a fabric still more like
our modern lace was made. A
groundwork was netted by making
one stitch at the beginning, and increasing
a stitch on each side till the
requisite size was obtained. On this
ground was worked the pattern,
sometimes darned in with counted
stitches, sometimes cut out of linen,
and <i>appliqué</i>. Still another kind was
drawn-work, threads being drawn
from linen or muslin, and the thinned
cloth worked into lace. Specimens
still exist of a six-sided lace net made
in this way, with sprigs worked over
it.</p>

<p>The earlier rich laces were not
made of white thread. Gold, silver,
and silk were used. The Italians,
who claim to have invented point
lace, were the great makers of gold
lace. Cyprus stretched gold into a
wire, and wove it. From Cyprus the
art reached Genoa, Venice, and
Milan; and gradually all Europe
learned to make gold lace. In England,
the complaint was raised that
the gold of the realm was sensibly
diminishing in this way, and in 1635
an act was passed prohibiting the
melting down of bullion to make
gold or silver “purl.” And not only
in Western and Southern Europe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
this luxury fashionable. A piece of
gold lace was found in a Scandinavian
barrow opened in the XVIIIth
century. Perhaps the lace was made
by some captive woman stolen by
the vikings, a later Proserpine ravished
from the South, who wove the
web with her pale fingers as she sat
in that frozen Hades, while her piratical
blue-eyed Pluto looked on marvelling,
and waiting to catch a smile
from her relenting eyes. Gold lace
was sold by weight.</p>

<p>Some of the most magnificent old
points of Venice were made of silk,
the natural cream-color. The rose
Venice point&mdash;<i>Gros point de Venice,
Punto a rilievo</i>&mdash;was the richest and
most complicated of all points. It
was worked of silk, on a parchment
pattern, the flowers connected by
<i>brides</i>. The outlines of these flowers
were in relief, cotton being placed
inside to raise them, and countless
beautiful stitches were introduced.
Sometimes they were in double,
sometimes in triple, relief, and each
flower and leaf was edged with fine
regular pearls. This point was highly
prized for albs, <i>collerettes</i>, <i>berthes</i>, and
costly decorations.</p>

<p>Another kind of Venice lace&mdash;knotted
point&mdash;had a charmingly romantic
origin. A young girl in one
of the islands of the Lagune, a lace-worker,
was betrothed to a young
sailor, who brought her home from
the Southern seas a bunch of pretty
coralline called mermaid’s lace.
Moved partly by love for the giver,
and partly by admiration for the
graceful nature of the seaweed, with
its small white knots united by a <i>bride</i>,
the girl tried to imitate it with her
needle, and, after several unsuccessful
efforts, produced a delicate guipure,
which soon was admired all over
Europe.</p>

<p>We must not, in this connection,
forget that handkerchief given by
Othello to Desdemona, the loss of
which cost her so dear. It was
wrought, he tells her, by an Egyptian
sibyl, who</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">“In her prophetic fury sewed the work.”</p>

<p class="p1">And he declares that</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">“The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk.”
</p>

<p class="p1">The flat points of Venice were no
less exquisite than the raised, the patterns
sometimes being human figures,
animals, cupids, and flowers.</p>

<p>In the XVIth century, Barbara
Uttmann invented pillow-net, a great
advance in the making of lace. This
lady’s father had moved from Nuremberg
to the Hartz Mountains, to
superintend mines there, and there
the daughter married a rich master-miner,
Christopher Uttmann, and
lived with him in his castle of Annaberg.
Seeing the mountain girls
weave nets for the miners to wear
over their hair, her inventive mind
suggested a new and easier way of
making fine netting. Her repeated
failures we know not of, but we know
of her success. In 1561 she set up a
workshop in her own name, and this
branch of industry spread so that
soon 30,000 persons were employed,
with a revenue of 1,000,000 thalers. In
1575, the inventress died and was
laid to rest in the churchyard of
Annaberg, where her tombstone records
that she was the “benefactress
of the Hartz Mountains.”</p>

<p>Honor to Barbara Uttmann!</p>

<p>Pillow-lace, as most people know,
is made on a round or oval board
stuffed so as to form a cushion. On
this is fixed a stiff piece of parchment
with the pattern pricked on it. The
threads are wound on bobbins about
the size of a pencil, with a groove at
the neck. As many of the threads as
will start well together are tied at the
ends in a knot, and the knot fastened
with a pin at the edge of the pattern;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
then another bunch, and so on, till
the number required by the lace is
completed. The lace is formed by
crossing or intertwining these bobbins.</p>

<p>Hand-made lace is of two kinds,
point and pillow. Point means a
needle-work lace made on a parchment
pattern, also a particular kind of
stitch. The word is sometimes incorrectly
applied; as, <i>point de Malines</i>,
<i>point de Valenciennes</i>, both these laces
being made on a pillow.</p>

<p>Lace consists of two parts, the
ground and the flower pattern or
gimp.</p>

<p>The plain ground is called in
French <i>entoilage</i>, on account of its
containing the ornament, which is
called <i>toilé</i>, from the texture resembling
linen, or being made of that material
or of muslin.</p>

<p>The honeycomb network or
ground&mdash;in French, <i>fond</i>, <i>champ</i>,
<i>réseau</i>&mdash;is of various kinds: wire
ground, Brussels ground, <i>trolly</i>
ground, etc. Double ground is so
called because twice the number of
threads are required to make it.</p>

<p>Some laces, points and guipures,
are not worked upon a ground, the
flowers being connected by irregular
threads worked over with <i>point noué</i>
(button-hole stitch), sometimes with
pearl loops (<i>picot</i>). Such are the
points of Venice and Spain and most
of the guipures. To these uniting-threads
lace-makers in Italy give the
name of “legs,” in England “pearl
ties,” in France “brides.”</p>

<p>The flower is made either together
with the ground, as in Valenciennes
and Mechlin, or separately, and then
either worked in or sewn on (<i>applique</i>).</p>

<p>The open-work stitches in the patterns
are called “modes,” “jours,”
or “fillings.”</p>

<p>The early name of lace in England
and France was <i>passement</i>, so called
because the threads were passed by
each other in the making. The
learned derive lace from <i>lacina</i>, a
Latin word signifying the hem or
fringe of a garment. <i>Dentelle</i> comes
from the little toothed edge with
which lace was finished after awhile.
At first, it was <i>passement dentelé</i>, finally
<i>dentelle</i>.</p>

<p>The meaning of guipure is hard to
connect with the present use of the
word, which is very loose and undefined.
It was originally made of
silk twisted round a little strip of thin
parchment or vellum; and silk twisted
round a thick thread or cord was
called guipure, hence the name.</p>

<p>The modern Honiton is called guipure,
also Maltese lace and its Buckingham
imitations. The Italians
called the old raised points of Venice
and Spain guipures. It is hard to
know what claim any of these have
to the name.</p>

<p>A fine silk guipure is made in the
harems of Turkey, of which specimens
were shown in the International
Exhibition. This <i>point de
Turquie</i> is but little known, and is
costly. It mostly represents black,
white, or mixed colors, fruit, flowers,
or foliage.</p>

<p>The lace once made in Malta was
a coarse kind of Mechlin or Valenciennes
of one arabesque pattern;
but since 1833, when an English
lady induced a Maltese woman
named Ciglia to copy in white an
old Greek coverlet, the Ciglia family
commenced the manufacture of black
and white Maltese guipure, till then
unknown in the island.</p>

<p>It is the fineness of the thread
which renders the real Brussels
ground, <i>vrai réseau</i>, so costly. The
finest is spun in dark underground
rooms; for contact with the dry air
causes the thread to break. The
spinner works by feeling rather than
sight, though a dark paper is placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to throw the thread out, and a single
ray of light is admitted to fall on the
work. She examines every inch
drawn from her distaff, and, when any
inequality occurs, stops her wheel to
repair the mischief.</p>

<p>The <i>réseau</i> is made in three different
ways: by hand, on the pillow, and
more lately by machinery&mdash;the last a
Brussels-net made of Scotch cotton.
The needle ground costs three times
as much as the pillow; but it is
stronger and easier to repair, the pillow
ground always showing the join.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of flowers:
those made with the needle, <i>point à
l’aiguille</i>, and those on the pillow,
<i>point plat</i>. The best flowers are
made in Brussels itself, where they
excel in the relief (<i>point brode</i>).</p>

<p>Each part of Brussels lace is made
by a different hand. One makes the
<i>vrai réseau</i>; another, the footing;
a third, the point flowers; a fourth
works the open <i>jours</i>; a fifth unites
the different sections of the ground
together; a sixth makes the <i>plat</i> flowers;
a seventh sews the flowers upon
the ground.</p>

<p>The pattern is designed by the
head of the fabric, who, having cut
the parchment into pieces, hands it
out ready pricked. In the modern
lace, the work of the needle and pillow
are combined.</p>

<p>Mechlin lace, sometimes called
<i>broderie de Malines</i> is a pillow lace
made all in one piece, its distinguishing
feature being a broad, flat thread
which forms the flower. It is very
light and transparent, and answers
very well as a summer lace. It is
said that Napoleon I. admired this
lace, and that, when he first saw the
light Gothic tracery of the cathedral
spire at Antwerp, he exclaimed:
“<i>C’est comme de la dentelle de Malines.</i>”</p>

<p>Valenciennes is also a pillow lace,
but the ground and gimp, or flower,
are all made of the same thread.</p>

<p>The <i>vrai Valenciennes</i>, as it was at
first named, that made in the city itself,
was made in the XVth century, of a
three-thread twisted flax, and reached
its climax about the middle of the
XVIIIth century, when there were
from 3,000 to 4,000 lace-makers in
the city alone. Then fashion began
to prefer the lighter and cheaper
fabrics of Arras, Lille, and Brussels,
till in 1790 the number of lace-workers
had diminished to 250. Napoleon
I. tried unsuccessfully to revive
the manufacture, and in 1851 only two
lace-makers remained, both over eighty
years of age. This <i>vrai Valenciennes</i>
which, from its durability, was called
<i>les eternelles Valenciennes</i>, could not,
it was asserted, be made outside the
walls of the city. It was claimed
that, if a piece of lace were begun at
Valenciennes and finished outside of
the walls, that part not made in the
city would be visibly less beautiful
than the other, though continued by
the same hand, with the same thread,
upon the same pillow. This was attributed
to some peculiarity of the
atmosphere. That lace, therefore,
which was made in the neighborhood
of the city was called <i>bâtarde</i> and
<i>gausse</i>.</p>

<p>The makers of this lace worked in
underground cellars from four in the
morning till eight at night. Young
girls were the chief workers, great
delicacy of touch being required, any
other kind of work spoiling the hand
for this. Many of the women, we
are told, became blind before reaching
the age of thirty. So great was
the labor of making this lace that,
while the Lille workers could produce
from three to five ells per day,
those of Valenciennes could not finish
more than an inch and a half in
that time. Some took a year to
make twenty-four inches, and it took
ten months, working fifteen hours a
day, to finish a pair of men’s ruffles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It was considered a recommendation
to have a piece of lace made all
by one hand.</p>

<p>This old Valenciennes was far superior
to any now made under that
name. The <i>réseau</i> was fine and
compact, the flowers resembling cambric
in their texture. The fault of
the lace was its color, never a pure
white, but, being so long under the
hand in a damp atmosphere, of a
reddish cast. In 1840, an old lady,
Mlle. Ursule, gathered the few old
lace-makers left in the city, and made
the last piece of <i>vrai Valenciennes</i> of
any importance which has been made
in the city. It was a head-dress, and
was presented by the city to the Duchesse
de Nemours.</p>

<p>In the palmy days of Valenciennes,
mothers used to hand these laces
down to their children as scarcely
less valuable than jewels. Even peasant
women would lay by their earnings
for a year to purchase a piece
of <i>vrai Valenciennes</i> for a head-dress.</p>

<p>One of the finest specimens of this
old lace known is a lace-bordered
alb belonging to the Convent of the
Visitation, at Le Puy, in Auvergne.
The lace is in three breadths, twenty-eight
inches wide, entirely of thread,
and very fine, though thick. The
ground is a clear <i>réseau</i>, the pattern
solid, of flowers and scrolls.</p>

<p>There is a story of Le Puy that in
1640 a sumptuary edict was issued by
the seneschal, forbidding all persons,
without regard to age, sex, or rank,
to wear lace of any kind. Lace-making
being the chief employment of
the women of this province, great
distress resulted from the edict. In
this time of trial, the beggared people
found a comforter in the Jesuit F.
Régis. He not only consoled them,
but he proved the sincerity of his
sympathy by acts. He went to Toulouse,
and obtained a revocation of
the edict; and at his suggestion the
Jesuits opened to the Auvergne laces
a market in the New World.</p>

<p>This good friend to the poor is
now S. Francis Régis, and is venerated
in Auvergne as the patron saint
of the lace-makers.</p>

<p>The finest and most elaborate Valenciennes
is now made at Ypres, in
Flanders. Instead of the close <i>réseau</i>
of the old lace, it has a clear wire
ground, which throws the figure out
well. On a piece of this Ypres lace
not two inches wide, from 200 to 300
bobbins are employed, and for larger
widths as many as 800 or more are
used on the same pillow. There are
now in Flanders 400 lace-schools, of
which 157 are the property of religious
communities.</p>

<p>We may say here that lace-makers
now use Scotch cotton chiefly, instead
of linen, finding it cheaper, more elastic,
and brilliant. Only Alençon,
some choice pieces of Brussels, and
the finer qualities of Mechlin are now
made of flax. The difference can
scarcely be perceived by the eye, and
both wash equally well, but the cotton
grows yellow with age, while linen
retains its whiteness.</p>

<p>Alençon, the only French lace now
made on a pillow, was first made in
France by an Italian worker, who,
finding herself unable to teach the
Alençon women the true Venetian
stitch, struck out a new path, and, by
assigning to each one a different part
of the work, as Brussels did afterward,
succeeded in producing the most
elaborate point ever made. Early
specimens show rich scroll-work connected
by <i>brides</i>. One piece has
portraits of Louis XVI. and Maria
Theresa, with the crown and cipher,
all entwined with flowers. The patterns
were not at first beautiful,
scarcely at all imitating nature; but
their work was perfect.</p>

<p>Point Alençon is made entirely by
the hand, on a parchment pattern, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
small pieces afterwards united by invisible
thread. This art of “fine
joining” was formerly a secret confined
to France and Belgium, but is
now known in England and Ireland.</p>

<p>Each part of this work is given to
a different person, who is trained from
childhood to that specialty. The
number formerly required was eighteen,
but is now twelve.</p>

<p>The design, engraved on copper,
is printed off in divisions upon pieces
of parchment ten inches long, each
piece numbered in order. This parchment,
which is green, is pricked with
the pattern, and sewed to a piece of
very coarse linen folded double.
The outline of the pattern is then
made by guiding two flat threads
around the edge with the left thumb,
and fixing them by minute stitches
passed with another thread and
needle through the holes in the parchment.
The work is then handed
over to another to make the ground,
either <i>bride</i> or <i>réseau</i>. The <i>réseau</i> is
worked back and forward from the
footing, or sewing-on-edge, to the <i>picot</i>,
or lower pearled edge. The flowers
are worked with a fine needle and
long thread, in button-hole stitch,
from left to right, the thread turned
back when the end of the flower is
reached, and worked over in the next
row, making thus a strong fabric.
Then come the open-work fillings
and other operations, after which the
lace is taken from the parchment by
passing a sharp razor between the
two folds of linen. The head of the
fabric then joins the parts together.
When finished, a steel instrument is
passed into each flower to polish it.</p>

<p>The manufacture of Alençon was
nearly extinct when Napoleon I. restored
its prosperity. Among the
orders executed for the emperor on
his marriage with Marie Louise was
a bed furniture of great richness.
Tester, coverlet, curtains, and pillow-cases
were all of the finest <i>Alençon à
bride</i>. Again the manufacture languished,
though efforts were made to
revive it, and, in 1840, two hundred
aged women&mdash;all who were left of
the workers&mdash;were gathered. But
the old point had been made by an
hereditary set of workers, and the
lace-makers they were obliged to call
to their help from other districts could
not learn their stitches, consequently
changes crept in. But the manufacture
was revived, and some fine specimens
were shown in the Exhibition
of 1851, among them a flounce
valued at 22,000 francs, which had
taken thirty-six women eighteen
months to complete. This appeared
afterwards in the Empress Eugénie’s
<i>corbeille de mariage</i>.</p>

<p>Alençon was chiefly used in the
magnificent <i>layette</i> prepared for the
prince imperial. The cradle-curtains
were Mechlin, the coverlet of Alençon
lined with satin. The christening
robe, mantle, and head-dress
were also of Alençon, and Alençon
covered the three <i>corbeille</i> bearing
the imperial arms and cipher, and
trimmed the twelve dozen embroidered
frocks and the aprons of the
imperial nurses.</p>

<p>Remembering all the magnificence
which clustered around the birth of
this infant, who had</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">“Queens at his cradle, proud and ministrant,”</p>

<p class="pn1">one thinks with sadness of that exiled
boy who now, weeping bitterly the
loss of a tender father, beholds receding
from his gaze, like a splendid
dream, that throne he once seemed
born to fill. Nowhere on the face of
the earth is one who has possessed
so much and lost so much as that
boy; and nowhere are a mother and
son around whom cling such a romantic
interest and sympathy.</p>

<p>The specimens of Alençon in the
Exhibition of 1862 maintained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
reputation of the ancient fabric.
<i>Bride</i> is but little made now, and is
merely twisted threads, far inferior to
the clear hexagon of the last century.
This hexagon was a <i>bride</i> worked
around with <i>point noué</i>.</p>

<p>Of late, the reapplication of Alençon
flowers has been successfully
practised by the peasant lace-workers
in the neighborhood of Ostend, who
sew them to a fine Valenciennes
ground.</p>

<p>The Chantilly lace, which owed its
foundation to Catherine de Rohan,
Duchesse de Longueville, has always
been rather an object of luxury than
of commercial value. Being considered
a royal fabric, and its production
for the nobility alone, the
lace-workers became the victims of
revolutionary fury in ‘93, and all perished
on the scaffold with their
patrons. The manufacture was,
however, revived, and prospered
greatly during the First Empire. The
white blonde was the rage in Paris in
1805. The black was especially
admired in Spain and her American
colonies. No other manufactories
produced such beautiful scarfs, mantillas,
and other large pieces. Calvados
and Bayeux make a similar
lace, but not so well. The real
Chantilly has a very fine <i>réseau</i>, and
the workmanship of the flowers is
close, giving the lace great firmness.
The so-called Chantilly shawls in the
Exhibition of 1862 were made at
Bayeux. Chantilly produces only
the extra fine shawls, dresses, and
scarfs.</p>

<p>Honiton owes its reputation to its
sprigs. Like the Brussels, they are
made separately. At first they were
worked in with the pillow, afterwards
<i>appliqué</i>, or sewed on a ground of plain
pillow-net. This net was very beautiful,
but very expensive. It was
made of the finest thread procured
from Antwerp, the market price of
which, in 1790, was £70 per pound.
Ninety-five guineas have been paid a
pound for this thread, and, in time of
war, one hundred guineas. The
price of the lace was costly in proportion,
the manner of fixing it peculiar.
The lace ground was spread out on
the counter, and the worker herself
desired to cover it with shillings.
The number of shillings that found a
place on her work was the price of
it. A Honiton veil often cost a
hundred guineas. But the invention
of machine-net changed all that, and
destroyed not only the occupation of
the makers of hand-net, but was the
cause of the lace falling into disrepute.</p>

<p>Desirous to revive the work, Queen
Adelaide ordered a dress of Honiton
sprigs, on a ground of Brussels-net,
the flowers to be copied from nature.
The skirt of this dress was encircled
with a wreath of elegantly designed
sprigs, the initials of the flowers forming
her majesty’s name: Amaranth,
Daphne, Eglantine, Lilac, Auricula,
Ivy, Dahlia, Eglantine.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria’s wedding lace was
made at Honiton, difficulty being
found in obtaining workers enough,
the manufacture had been so little
patronized. The dress, which cost
1,000 pounds, was entirely of Honiton
sprigs connected on a pillow.
The patterns were destroyed as soon
as the lace was made. Several of the
princesses have had their bridal
dresses of Honiton.</p>

<p>The application of Honiton sprigs
upon bobbin-net has of late almost
entirely given place to guipure. The
sprigs are sewed on a piece of blue
paper, and then united by the pillow,
by cut-works, or purlings, or else
joined with the needle, button-hole
stitch being the best of all, or by
purling which is made by the yard.
But Honiton has fallen in public
esteem by neglecting the pattern of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
its lace, which does not well imitate
nature.</p>

<p>A new branch of industry has
lately risen there&mdash;that of restoring or
remaking old lace.</p>

<p>When old lace revived, it became a
mania. The literary ladies were the
first to take this fever in England.
Sidney, Lady Morgan, and Lady
Stepney made collections, and the
Countess of Blessington left at her
death several large chests full of fine
antique lace.</p>

<p>In Paris, the celebrated dressmaker,
Madame Camille, was the first one to
bring old laces into fashion.</p>

<p>Much lace is taken from old tombs,
cleansed, and sold, usually after having
been made over. All over Europe
it was the custom to bury the
dead in lace-trimmed garments, and
in some cases these burial toilets were
of immense value. In Bretagne,
the bride, after her marriage, laid
aside her veil and dress, and never
wore it again till it was put on after
she was dead. Many of these old
tombs have been rifled, and the contents
sold to dealers.</p>

<p>In Ireland, lace-making was at one
time quite successful. Swift, in the
last century, urged the protection of
home manufactures of all kinds, and
the Dublin Society, composed of a
band of patriots organized in 1749,
encouraged the making of lace, and
passed strong resolutions against the
wearing of foreign lace. Lady Arabella
Demy, who died in 1792, a
daughter of the Earl of Kerry, was
especially active in the work, and
good imitations of Brussels and
Ypres lace were made. In 1829, the
manufacture of Limerick lace was established.
This is tambour work on
Nottingham-net. But the emigration
of girls to America, and the effort of
the manufacturers to produce a cheap
article, thus bringing it into disrepute,
have prevented this lace from attaining
success.</p>

<p>For half a century, machine-lace
has been striving to imitate hand-made
lace, and in some instances
with such success that the difference
can scarcely be perceived. In 1760
a kind of looped lace was made in
England on the stocking-frame, and
the fabric has been constantly improving.
But hand-made lace still
maintains its supremacy, and is growing
in favor, and old laces are more
highly prized even than old jewels,
since the former cannot be imitated, or
can scarcely be imitated; the latter
may be. There is a delicacy and
finish in needle and pillow laces
which the machine can never give;
besides that, the constant tendency
of machine-work, when once it
has attained excellence, is to deteriorate.</p>

<p>We are glad of this revival of lace-making;
for in no other way can the
luxury of the rich in dress so well
benefit women and children among
the poor. Most working-women
have to work too hard, and they
have to leave their homes to earn
money. But lace-making accords
admirably with feminine taste and
feminine delicacy of organization,
and it can be done at any time, and
at home, and of every quality. It is
refining, too. One can scarcely imagine
a very coarse person making a
very beautiful lace. It teaches the
worker to observe nature and art, in
the selection and working of patterns,
and it stimulates inventiveness, if
there be any. And more than that,
by the multitudinous ticking of these
little bobbins, and the myriad points
of these shining needles, thousands of
that tortured and terrible class called
“the poor” might be able to keep at
bay not only the wolf of hunger, but
the lion of crime.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">We</span> have received this article from
a very distinguished and learned
member of the New York bar, with
an accompanying letter, in which he
writes, among other things, as follows:</p>

<p>“Confined as I am by my infirmities
to my house, and wearying of the
sameness of the life I have to lead, I
sometimes vary my occupation by
delving into the ‘Antiquities of the
Law.’</p>

<p>“I have lately come across an old
law book published in 1711, which
has been several years in my library,
but entirely lost sight of by me until
recently.</p>

<p>“From that I have been compiling
some articles for one of our law journals,
and began the accompanying
article for the same publication.</p>

<p>“While writing it, it occurred to me
that it might be more useful, if not
more interesting, to the readers of
such a journal as your <span class="smcap">Catholic
World</span> than to those of a mere law
journal; and as I abhor religious intolerance
in all forms, and see so much
of it in this country, I concluded to
send it to you, thinking perhaps you
may deem it advisable to use it.”]</p>

<p>“Any Man may build a Church

Notice of it as such till it is consecrated,
and therefore, whether Church
or Chappel, it must be tried by the
Certificate of the Bishop.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Clergy and Benefit of Clergy.</span>&mdash;“Before
the 20 <i>Ed. I.</i>, the Clergy
paid no Tenths to the King for their
Ecclesiastical Livings, but to the
Pope; but in that King’s reign, their
Livings were valued all over England,
and the Tenths paid to the
King; and by the Statute 26 <i>Hen.
VIII. cap.</i> 3, they were annexed to the
Crown forever.”</p>

<p>Many of their privileges were
“confirmed by <i>Magna Carta</i>, viz.,
<i>Quod Ecclesia sit libera</i>.”</p>

<p>“As to the Benefit of Clergy, it
was introduced by the Canon Law,
Exempting their persons from any
Temporal Jurisdiction. ‘Tis a Privilege
on purpose to save the Life of a
Criminal in certain cases, if he was a
man of learning, as accounted in
those Days, for as such he might be
useful to the Publick.&mdash;At first it was
extended to any person who could
read, he declaring that he had vowed
or was resolved to enter into Orders,
and the Reading was to show he was
qualified.&mdash;But afterwards the reading
without a Vow to enter into Orders
was held good, and now ‘tis become
a legal conveyance of Mercy
to both Clergy and Laity.”</p>

<p>“But tho’ the Ordinary usually
tenders the Book, the Court are
the proper Judges of the Criminal’s
Reading: Therefore, where the Ordinary
answer <i>Quod legit</i>, the Court
judged otherwise, fined the Ordinary,
and hanged the Person.”</p>

<p>“Now, if a Man cannot read where
Clergy is allowable, and ‘tis recorded
by the Court <i>Quod non legit</i>: if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Offender be reprieved, the Book may
be tendered to him again because ‘tis
<i>in favorem vitæ</i>, for which Reason he
may have it under the Gallows.”
<i>Dyer</i>, 205 <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>“In those days, an offender might
have his Clergy even for Murder
<i>toties quoties</i>, but this was restrained
by the statute of 4 <i>Hen. VII. cap.</i> 13,
that he should have it but once.
And for the better Observance of
that Law, it was then provided That
the Criminal should be marked upon
the Brawn of the Left Thumb, that
he might be known again upon a
second Offence”&mdash;“which was not
intended as any Part of the Judgment”&mdash;“It
was only a Mark set
upon the Offender that he might not
have his Clergy a second Time.”</p>

<p>By the Common Law, “all Offenders,
except in Treason against
the Person of the Queen,” should
have the Benefit of Clergy “and
<i>toties quoties</i>; but by statute of 25 <i>Ed.
III. cap.</i> 4, it was prohibited in Treasons;
and by that of 4 <i>Hen. VII.</i> it is
restrained to one Time, so that now
(<i>i.e.</i> in 1711) there are but very few
cases wherein the Common Law denies
Clergy, but in many ‘tis taken
away by several acts of Parliament.”</p>

<p>Among those from whom it was
thus taken away, were Popish Recusants
by act of 35 <i>Eliz. cap.</i> 1 and 2,
and those who receive Priests being
natives of England, and ordained by
the See of Rome by act of 27 <i>Eliz.
cap.</i> 2.</p>

<p>“In Anno 2 <i>Ed. VI.</i>, the Reformers,
intending to bring the Worship
of God under set forms, compiled a
Book of Common Prayer, which was
established by Act of Parliament in
that year.”</p>

<p>“But because several things were
contained in that Book which showed
a compliancy to the superstitious
Humours of those times, and some
Exceptions being made to it by precise
Men at Home and by <span class="smcap">John

Bill was brought into the House of
Lords to enjoin Conformity to this
new Book with these Alterations, by
which all People were to come to
those Common Prayers under pain of
Church Censure, which Bill passed
into a Law, <i>Anno</i> 5 and 6 <i>Ed. VI.</i>;

likewise added.”</p>

<p>“Upon these and other Statutes
several Things are to be considered:</p>

another.”</p>

<p>“Likewise, in the same Year, all
<i>Licenses</i> and <i>Dispensations</i> from the
Court of Rome were prohibited, and
that all <i>Religious Houses</i> should be
under the <i>Visitation of the King</i>.”</p>

<p>And by an Act passed the same
Year (viz., 1534), The King was
“declared to be <i>Supream Head of
the Church</i>.”</p>

<p>“But he did not exercise any act
of that Power till a year afterwards,
by appointing Sir Thomas <i>Cromwell</i>
to be his Vicar General in Ecclesiastical
Matters, and Visitor of all the
<i>Monasteries</i> and other Privileged
Places in the Kingdom.”</p>

<p>In 27 <i>Hen. VIII.</i> (1536) “all the
<i>lesser Monasteries</i>, under the number
of <i>twelve Persons</i>, and whose Revenues
were not of the Value of £200
<i>per annum</i>, were given to the King,
his Heirs and Successors; and a
Court was erected on purpose for
collecting the Revenues belonging to
these Monasteries, which was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<i>The Court of Augmentation of the
King’s Revenue</i>, who had full power
to dispose of those Lands for the Service
of the King.”</p>

<p>The officers of this Court had,
among its other duties, that of inquiring
“into the Number of <i>Religious</i>
in the House, and what Lives they
led; how many would go into other
Religious Houses, and how many
into the <i>World</i>, as they called it.”</p>

<p>The whole of the goods thus confiscated
were valued at £100,000,
and the rents of these small Monasteries
came to £32,000 <i>per annum</i>.</p>

<p>“This occasioned great Discontents
amongst the people,” to appease
which the King sold some of the
Lands “to the Gentry” at low Rates,
“obliging them to keep up Hospitality.”</p>

<p>“This pleased both them and the
ordinary Sort of People for a little
time; and, to satisfy others,” the
King “continued or gave back
thirty-one Houses. But these, about
two Years afterwards, fell under the
Common Fate of the great Monasteries,
and were all suppressed with
them.”</p>

<p>“But notwithstanding he gave back
some of these Houses, yet the People
were still discontented, and openly
rebelled in <i>Lincolnshire</i>, which was
quieted by a Pardon: There was another
Rebellion in <i>Yorkshire</i> and the
Northern Counties, which ended also
in a Pardon, only some of the chief
of the Rebels were executed for this
last Rebellion.”</p>

<p>Most of the Monasteries, “seeing
their Dissolution drawing near, made
voluntary Surrenders of their Houses
in the 29th <i>year of Hen. VIII.</i>, in
Hopes by this means to obtain Favor
of the King; and after the Rebellion,
the rest of the Abbots, both great
and small, did the like; for some of
them had encouraged the Rebels,
others were convicted by the Visitors
of great Disorders, and most of
them had secured all the Plate, Jewels
and Furniture belonging to their
Houses, to make Provision for them
and Relations and then surrendered
their Monasteries.”</p>

<p>“Afterwards, <i>Anno</i> 31 <i>Hen. VIII.</i>,
a Bill was brought into the House of
Peers to confirm these surrenders.
There were 18 Abbots<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> present at
the first Reading, 20 at the second,
and 17 at the third. It soon passed
the Commons and the Royal Assent;
and by this Act all the Houses, etc.,
were confirmed to the King.”</p>

<p>“‘Tis true, the Hospitallers, Colleges
and Chanteries, etc., were not
yet dissolved.... These had
large endowments to support themselves
and to entertain Pilgrims,” etc.</p>

<p>“But notwithstanding the King
was declared to be the Supreme Head
of the Church, yet these Hospitallers
would not submit,” etc., “and therefore,
Anno 32 <i>Hen. VIII. cap.</i> 24,
The Parliament gave their lands to
the King and dissolved their Corporation.”</p>

<p>“The Colleges and Chanteries still
remained; but the Doctrine of Purgatory
being then grown out of Belief<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
and some of those Fraternities
having resigned in the same manner
as the Monasteries, the Endowments
of the rest were then thought to be
for no purpose, and therefore, <i>Anno</i>
37 <i>Hen. VIII.</i>, all these Colleges,
Free Chapels, Chanteries, etc., were
given to the King by Act of Parliament.”</p>

<p>“Thus in the Compass of a few
years, the Power and Authority of
the See of <i>Rome</i> was suppressed in
this Kingdom. And because frequent
Attempts have been made to
revive it, therefore, in succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Times, several Laws have been made
to keep them in subjection.”</p>

<p>Among those were the following:
Recusant Convict above 16 must go
to his place of Abode and not remove
5 miles without license or
otherwise abjure the Realm. Not
departing within the time limited by
the Justices, or returning without license
from the Queen, was felony

<p>A married woman, a Popish Recusant
convict, “not conforming
within 3 months after conviction,

will pay to the King 10 shillings

<p>“Saying Mass forfeits 200 marks,

<p>“Jesuits, Seminary Priests, etc.,

within the Queen’s Dominions, coming

is guilty of Treason.” 27 <i>Eliz.
cap.</i> 2.</p>

<p>“Any knowing a Jesuit or Priest
to be here and not within 12 days
afterwards discovering him to a Justice
of Peace shall be committed and
fined.” 27 <i>Eliz. cap.</i> 2.</p>

<p>“Per Stat. 3 <i>Jac. cap.</i> 4, to move
any one to promise Obedience to the
See of Rome or other Prince is High
Treason in the Mover and he that
promiseth Obedience.”</p>

<p>“Recusant Convict must not practice

Queen or six of her Privy Council,
whereof the Principal Secretary of

<p>“Notwithstanding all these Laws,
the Parliament (11 and 12 <i>Will.</i>) was
of Opinion that Popery increased,

<p>“They are said to be Ecclesiastical
Inheritances collateral to the Estate
of the Land, out of which they
arise, and are of their own Nature due
only to Spiritual Persons.”</p>

<p>Certain Lands were, however, exempt.
“Most orders of Monks were
first exempted; but in time this was
restrained to three orders&mdash;Cistertians,
Hospitallers, Templars.”</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Dissenters.</span>&mdash;After the various
laws against “Popish Recusants,” as
they were called, had had the effect
of rendering somewhat firm the establishment
of the English Protestant
Church, and about the time of the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, a new trouble
arose from those who dissented
from that church, in its forms and in
some of its principles, and government
then began to interfere with
them.</p>

<p>In the 1st Year of the reign of
William and Mary these “Dissenters”
were exempted from the statutes
of 1 <i>Eliz. cap.</i> 2, 23 <i>Eliz. cap.</i> 1,
3 <i>Jac. cap.</i> 4, above mentioned.
“But they must not assemble in
Places with Doors locked, barred, or
bolted, nor until the place is certified
to the Bishop of the Diocese or to
the Arch Deacon or to the Justices
at the Quarter Sessions, and registered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
there and they have a certificate
thereof.”</p>

<p>Their Preachers must declare their
Approbation, and subscribe the “Articles
of Religion,” except the 20th,
34th, 35th, and 36th articles, and
must take the oaths and subscribe the
Declaration prescribed Dy certain
statutes, and that at the Quarter
Sessions where they live.</p>

<p>So that, from the reign of Elizabeth,
through the reign of James I.,
and until the the troubles which
ended in the civil war and the Protectorate
of Cromwell, Dissenters
were subject to many of the restrictions
which had been imposed on the
Roman Catholics; and even when
those troubles finally ended in the
flight of James II., and the elevation
of William and Mary to the throne,
freedom of religion was not allowed
to the Dissenters, but they were permitted
to enjoy their dissent from the
forms and ceremonies of the Church
of England only by declaring their
assent to many of its most important
tenets of faith or doctrine.</p>

<p>The oaths of allegiance and supremacy
enjoined by the statutes
of <i>1 Eliz.</i> and <i>3 Jac.</i> were abrogated
by the Statute of <i>1 Will., and
Mar. cap. 8</i>, and the following substituted:</p>

<p>“I, A. B., do sincerely promise and
swear that I will be faithful and bear
true allegiance,” etc.</p>

<p>“I, A. B., do swear that I do from
my Heart abhor, detest and abjure
as Impious and Heretical, that damnable
Doctrine and Position that
Princes excommunicated or deprived
by the Pope or any authority of the
See of Rome may be deposed by
their subjects or any other whatsoever;
and I do declare that no Foreign
Prince, Person, Prelate, State
or Potentate, hath or ought to have
any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority,
Pre-eminence or Authority, Ecclesiastical
or Spiritual, within the Realm.
So help me God.”</p>

<p class="pc2 reduct">FROM THE FRENCH OF CHARLES DUBOIS.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="pc1">IN WHICH WE ARE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH MADAME AGNES.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">About</span> twenty years ago, I lived in
a town in France which I may be
allowed to call Philopolis. It need
not be sought on the map: it will
not be found there, at least under the
name I think it proper to call it by,
in order to avoid all appearance of
indiscretion. The story I am about
to relate is really a true one.</p>

<p>I had just finished my school-days,
and, having carefully thought over
the different professions which seemed
to accord with my tastes, I felt&mdash;and
it may be imagined how bitterly&mdash;that
not one of them was within
my means. To embrace any of them
would have required a larger sum
than I had the least hope of. Under
such unfavorable circumstances,
I became a tutor in a Lycée.</p>

<p>God preserve my very enemies, if
I have any, from so trying an occupation!
At the end of three months,
worn out with my labors, and overwhelmed
with humiliations and sadness,
I had fallen into such a state
of discouragement, not to say of despair,
that I regarded myself as the
most unfortunate of men.</p>

<p>To those who wish to be distinguished
from the crowd, there is
something peculiarly attractive in
looking upon themselves as more
unhappy than common mortals. I
gave myself up to this notion, at first
through vanity. But this kind of
superiority is by no means cheering,
I assure you, so I soon sought consolation.
Thank God, I had not far
to go. My old friend, Mme. Agnes,
was at hand. I sought refuge
with her. I speak as if she were
advanced in years, but it must be
acknowledged she would have seemed
a mere child to Methuselah. She
was thirty-six years of age; but I was
only eighteen, and thought her old.</p>

<p>Mme. Agnes lived on a broad and
pleasant quay that gently sloped
towards a noble river. Not fifty
steps from the house rolled the swift
current of the Loire. Beyond was
an extensive plain from which rose
innumerable spires.</p>

<p>When I arrived, I found my friend
in her usual seat near the window.
She was in a large arm-chair, with a
table before her, on which were all
the materials necessary for a painter
of miniatures. Mme. Agnes was renowned
in Philopolis as an artist.
Her uncommon talent enabled her
to support her mother and young
sister in a comfortable manner.
Alas! poor lady, she had been a paralytic
for ten years.</p>

<p>According to her custom, she laid
aside her work when I entered, and
welcomed me with a smile. But this
expression of pleasure gave place to
one of motherly anxiety when she
observed the sad face I wore.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, my poor
child?” said she. “You have grown
frightfully thin.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say I am ill,” I replied,
“but I am down-hearted, and
have so much reason to be, that
things cannot continue long in this
way: I should die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus saying, I leaned my head
against Mme. Agnes’ chair, like a
great child as I was, and cried heartily.
I had so long restrained my
tears!...</p>

<p>Mme. Agnes softly placed her hand
on my head, and consoled me
with a kindness truly maternal.
When my explosion of grief had
passed away, she made me give her
an account of my troubles. I told
her, perhaps for the tenth time, what
an inclination I had for a literary life,
only I was absolutely too poor to
embrace it. I added that my duties
as a tutor were repugnant; the pupils
were insolent and unfeeling; in short,
I concealed nothing that afflicted
me. At length I ended with these
words:</p>

<p>“You now see, Mme. Agnes,
that I could not be more wretched
than I am. This must end. Give
me, I beg, some of the good advice
I have so many times received from
you. Tell me what I must do.”</p>

<p>“Have patience, my child, and
wait till God makes the way smoother.”</p>

<p>“Wait! when one suffers as I
do?... When I abhor my position?...
When I feel how happy I could
be elsewhere!... Ah! Mme. Agnes,
if you knew what I have to endure&mdash;if
you only comprehended
my complete despair!”</p>

<p>“Poor child, your trials are bitter,
I acknowledge; but you are
young, capable, and industrious,
and will get a better position by-and-by.”</p>

<p>“To be forced to endure it only
a year would be beyond my strength.
Neither my disposition, nor tastes,
nor health could stand what I have
to bear.”</p>

<p>“How many others are in a similar
position, but without even the
hope you have of soon exchanging
an employment without results&mdash;detestable,
if you like&mdash;for one more
congenial! The task they are pursuing
must be that of their whole lives.
They know it, and resign themselves
to it. You, who have only to bear
your trials for a certain time, must
imitate their example. Come, come,
my friend, every one has his cross
here below. Let us bear ours cheerfully,
and it will soon seem light.”</p>

<p>These consoling words were uttered
in a sympathetic tone, as if they
came from the heart. I was touched.
I began to look at Mme. Agnes
more attentively than ever before,
and the thought occurred to me
like a revelation: “How much this
woman must have suffered, and how
instructive would be the account of
her life!”</p>

<p>“Mme. Agnes,” said I, “your
advice is excellent, but example
would produce a still greater impression
on me. I beg you to relate the
history of your life. You have evidently
gone through much suffering,
and with great patience, I am confident.
I will endeavor to conform
to your example.”</p>

<p>“You require a sad task of me,”
she replied; “but no matter, I will
gratify you. My story&mdash;and who of
us has not one?&mdash;will prove useful to
you, I think. But you must not be so
ready to declare me a saint. I never
was one, as you will soon see. Yes,
I have suffered, as you suppose&mdash;greatly
suffered, and have learned
that the best means of mitigating our
sufferings is to submit to God’s will,
and to cherish it. The lesson to be
derived from my history will be of
use to you, I trust, and therefore
I yield to your request.</p>

<p>“One word more before commencing.
I would observe that the account
of my own life is closely interwoven
with the lives of several persons
whom you will not reproach me
for making you acquainted with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
By a concurrence of circumstances
which would appear to me almost
inexplicable did I not behold the
hand of God therein, my life for
many years was identified, so to
speak, with theirs. I witnessed the
struggles these loved ones had to
make; I shared their very thoughts;
I sympathized in their sorrows, as
they in mine; and I also had the
happiness of participating in their
joys.</p>

<p>“When, therefore, I invoke these
remembrances you wish me to recall,
I find all along the pathway of my
life these friends now gone. I could
not relate my own history without
relating theirs. But everything encourages
me to go on. The task is
pleasant. It is sweet to speak of
those we have loved! The faithful
picture I am going to draw of their
lives will be as full of instruction to
you, my friend, as that of my own.”</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="pc1">PROVIDENCE SENDS A LODGER.</p>

<p class="p1">To begin: my father, a worthy
man and a sincere Christian, was a
<i>Chef de Division</i> at the Préfecture. A
sudden illness bereft me of his care
when I was barely fifteen years old.
My mother, my young sister, and
myself were left in quite limited circumstances,
being wholly dependent
on the rent of this small house, which
had belonged to the family many
years. Some time after, a pension
of five hundred francs was added to
our income by the government which
my father had faithfully served. Our
position was very sad, and the more
so because, during my father’s life,
we had everything in abundance.
But our misfortunes offered us a
thousand inducements to draw nearer
to God. It is only ill-balanced
souls&mdash;at once proud and weak&mdash;that
disregard him who chastises
them. Poor souls! they are doubly
to be pitied, for they suffer and
do not have recourse to him who
alone can console them! As for us,
God granted us the grace to recognize
his agency. He sustained us,
and we humbly submitted to his divine
decrees. Misfortune only rendered
us the more pious.</p>

<p>I had had a special taste for painting
from my childhood, but still lacked
proficiency, notwithstanding the
lessons I had taken. I now set to work
with ardor, though I had no master.
At the end of a year I had made so
much progress that an old teacher of
mine, the principal of a boarding-school&mdash;an
excellent person, who
took an interest in our affairs&mdash;received
me as teacher of drawing in
her establishment. She also made
me give English lessons to beginners.
This additional resource restored
ease in a measure to our household.
Nevertheless, we were obliged to
practise the strictest economy. To
enable us to get on swimmingly, as
my mother said with a smile, we at
last resolved to rent the spacious
ready-furnished apartments on the
ground floor. The first story was
occupied by a lodger, who was, at
the same time, a friend of ours. As
for us, we lived in the second story.</p>

<p>Things went on thus for some
years. I was nearly twenty, when
one day a young man, whom neither
my mother nor myself knew, called
to say he had heard our furnished
rooms were vacant, and that he would
like to occupy them. My mother was
greatly pleased with his frank, open
manner. She is very social, you
know, and made the stranger sit
down. They entered into conversation,
and I sat listening to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Am I mistaken, monsieur?” said
my mother, after a while; “it seems
as if I have already met you somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” replied the young
man, “I have had the honor of seeing
you more than once.”</p>

<p>“But where?”</p>

<p>“At M. Comte, the apothecary’s.
I was the head clerk there.”</p>

<p>“That is it!... I remember now....
And you have left him?”</p>

<p>“Under the most singular circumstances.
It seems I am a writer
without being aware of it.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“You know the Philopolis <i>Catholic
Journal</i>?”</p>

<p>“Certainly: an excellent paper.
It is a great pity it is not so successful
as it deserves to be. But between
us, it is partly its own fault: it
lacks interest and ability. It has
only one able contributor&mdash;Victor
Barnier, but he does not write often
enough.”</p>

<p>“The poor fellow cannot help it.
His duties at the apothecary’s shop
have naturally superseded his taste
for journalism.” ...</p>

<p>“What! are you Victor Barnier?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“Ah! well, young man, you do
not lack talent.”</p>

<p>“Others have said the same, madame.
I hope you are not all mistaken,
especially for the sake of the
<i>Catholic Journal</i>, of which I have
been appointed the principal editor.
I refused the post at first, the responsibility
seemed so great. They
insisted. The position surpassed my
wishes. Without any one’s knowing
it, I had for many years ardently
longed to be a writer. But like so
many others, the limited circumstances
of my family prevented it. Now,
thanks to this unexpected offer, the
opportunity of following my natural
inclinations is so tempting that I
cannot resist it. My good mother
tells me it is a perilous career, and
that I shall meet with more trouble
than success. No matter! I am so
fond of literary pursuits that, were
they to afford me only one day of
happiness in my life, I should still
cling to them. And then, I say it
without boasting, I love above all
things the cause I am to defend, and
hope through divine assistance to become
its able champion. I have,
therefore, left M. Comte’s, though
not without some regret. I enter
upon my duties to-morrow, and&mdash;am
in want of lodgings.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, that is all settled. You
shall come here and be well taken
care of.”</p>

<p>After this, Victor left us. I
have only given you the substance
of the conversation in which I more
than once took part. I must confess
Victor won my esteem and good-will
at this first interview. He
merited them. He was at once an
excellent and a talented man&mdash;that
was to be seen at the first glance.
The better he was known, the more
evident it became that his outward
appearance, pleasing as it was, was
not deceptive. He was then twenty-five
years old, but, though young, he
had had many trials, I assure you&mdash;trials
similar to yours, my young
friend, but much more severe.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="pc1">TRUE LOVE&mdash;HAPPY UNION.</p>

<p class="p1">The following day Victor took up
his abode with us. Before a fortnight
had elapsed, my mother was
enchanted with her new lodger. She
sounded his praises from morning
till night. This may perhaps astonish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
you, but you must know that she
and I were always in the habit of
telling each other our very thoughts.
This reciprocal confidence was so
perfect that it might be truly said we
concealed nothing from each other.</p>

<p>And I must confess Victor showed
himself every day more worthy of my
mother’s admiration. He was the
most modest, amiable, industrious,
and orderly of young men&mdash;a genuine
model for Christian men of letters.
He rose every morning at an
early hour, and worked in his room
till about eight o’clock. Then, unless
his occupations were too pressing,
he heard Mass at a neighboring
church. After that, he went to the
<i>Journal</i> office, where he remained
till noon; then he returned to breakfast.
He left again at one, came
back at three, worked till dinnertime,
then studied till ten at night,
and often later.</p>

<p>“Why do you work so hard?”
said my mother to him one day.
“The life of a journalist, according
to you, is that of a galley-slave. I
never should have thought an editor
had so hard a time. You have all
the four large pages of the <i>Journal</i> to
write yourself, then, M. Victor?”</p>

<p>“By no means, dear madame. I
write the leading article every day,
and in a short time, too, for I have
the peculiarity of not writing well
when I write slowly. This done, I
look over the other articles for the
paper. As I am responsible for them,
I do not accept them till they are
carefully examined. This is my
whole task&mdash;apparently an easy one,
but tedious and difficult in reality.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I see you have a great deal
to do at the office; but why do you
continue to work at home?”</p>

<p>“Two motives oblige me to study&mdash;to
increase my knowledge, and prevent
ennui. Having risen from a
mere apothecary’s clerk to be the
chief editor of an important journal,
I have to apply myself to keep apace
with my new profession. A journalist
must be imprudent or dishonest
who discusses any subject on which
he has not sufficient information.
And think of the multitude of questions
connected with politics, political
economy, legislation, literature, and
religion itself which I have in turn
to treat of! In the Paris newspapers,
each editor writes on the subjects he
understands the best. The work is
thus divided, to the great advantage
of the paper and its editors. Here,
I alone am often responsible for
everything. Nevertheless, the care
of my health, as well as my indolence,
would induce me to rest a few hours
a day; but where shall I pass them?&mdash;At
the café? I go there sometimes
to extend my knowledge of human
nature; but one cannot go there
much without being in danger of
contracting injurious habits.&mdash;With
my friends? I have none, and am
in no hurry to make any. The choice
of a friend is such a serious thing!
One cannot be too cautious about
it.”</p>

<p>“Come and see us,” said my mother,
with her habitual cordiality.
“When you have nowhere else to
go, and your mind is weary, come up
and pass an hour in the evening with
your neighbors.”</p>

<p>Victor came, at first occasionally,
then every day. Only a few weeks
elapsed before I felt that I loved him.
His companionship was so delightful;
he had so much delicacy in little
things; he was so frank, so devoted
to all that is beautiful and good!
Did he love me in return? No one
could have told, for he was as timid
as a young girl.</p>

<p>But this timidity was surmounted
when my feast-day arrived. He came
in blushing with extreme embarrassment&mdash;poor
dear friend! I can still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
see him&mdash;holding a bouquet in his
left hand, which he concealed behind
him, while with the other he presented
my mother with an open paper.
She took it, glanced at it, and, after
reading a few words, said:</p>

<p>“But this is not addressed to me.
Here, Agnes, these stanzas are for you,
my child! And I see a bouquet!”</p>

<p>Victor presented it to me in an
agitated manner. I myself was so
confused that I longed to run away
to hide my embarrassment. I concealed
it as well as I could behind
the sheet on which the stanzas were
written, and read them in a low tone.
They gracefully thanked my mother
for all her kindness to him, and ended
with some wishes for me&mdash;wishes that
were ardent and touching. In a
tremulous tone I expressed my gratitude
with a sincerity which was quite
natural. Our embarrassment was
not of long continuance. It soon
passed off, and we spent the
evening in delightful conversation.
One would have thought we had always
lived together, and formed but
one family.</p>

<p>The next morning, when I returned
from giving my lessons, what was my
astonishment to find Victor with my
mother!</p>

<p>“Here she is to decide the question,”
exclaimed the latter joyfully.
“M. Victor loves you, and wishes to
know if you will be his wife.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” I replied, “must I be
separated from you?”</p>

<p>“Less than ever,” cried Victor.</p>

<p>My delightful dream was realized!
I was to be united to the man I
loved with all my heart&mdash;whom I
esteemed without any alloy! And
this without being obliged to separate
from her of whom I was the sole
reliance.</p>

<p>I extended my hand to Victor, and
threw myself into my mother’s arms,
thanking her as well as I could, but
in accents broken by tears....</p>

<p>A month after, we were married,
and happy&mdash;as happy, I believe, as
people can be here below.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="pc1">SAD PRESENTIMENTS.</p>

<p class="p1">Thenceforth began a life so sweet
that I am unable to describe it.
Victor and I lived in the most delightful
harmony. Our love for each
other increased daily. We had but
one heart and one soul. Our very
tastes accorded.</p>

<p>Oh! how charming and happy is
the wedded life of two Christian souls!
What mutual sympathy! How they
divine each other’s thoughts! How
readily they make the concessions at
times so necessary, for the best
matched people in this world do not
always agree! A life more simple
than ours cannot be imagined, and
yet it was so sweet!</p>

<p>I worked beside Victor in the
morning and during a part of the
afternoon, looking at him from time
to time, saying a few words, or listening
as he read what he had just
composed. He said he first tried
the effect of his writings on me.
How happy I was when he thus
gave me the first taste of one of his
spirited articles, in which he defended
his principles with an ardor of
conviction and a vigor of style which
impressed even those who were
sceptical.</p>

<p>Before dinner we went to walk together.
I persuaded Victor to devote
a part of each day to physical
exercise as well as mental repose.
Our conversation always gave a
fresh charm to these walks. And
yet we did not talk much, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
infused our whole souls into a word
or two, or a smile. How often I
dreamed of heaven during those delicious
hours! It is thus, I said to
myself, the angels above hold communion
with each other. They have
no need of words to make themselves
understood.</p>

<p>Among the pleasant features of
that period, I must not forget that
of Victor’s success. Before he was
appointed editor, the poor paper
vegetated. There were but few subscribers.
No one spoke of the obscure
sheet which timidly defended
sound principles and true doctrines.
What a sad figure it made in the
presence of its contemporary, <i>The
Independent</i>&mdash;a shameless, arrogant
journal which boasted of despising
all religious belief, and scoffed at the
honest people foolish enough to read
it!</p>

<p>Victor had scarcely been chief
editor of this despised paper three
months before there was a decided
change. Every day added to the
list of subscribers. The <i>Catholic
Journal</i> was spoken of on all sides.
The sceptical, even, discussed it. As
to <i>The Independent</i>, it was forced to
descend into the arena. In spite of
itself, it had to engage in conflict
against an adversary as skilled in
irony as in logic. I acknowledge I
was proud of Victor’s success, and,
what was more, it made me happy.
For a long time, young as I was, I
had groaned at seeing Catholic interests
so poorly defended. They were
now as ably sustained as I could
wish, and by the man whom I loved.
All my wishes were surpassed!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is no perfect
happiness in this world. Even those
blissful years were not exempt from
sorrow. God granted me twice, with
an interval of two years, the long-wished-for
joy of being a mother, but
each time Providence only allowed
its continuance a few months. My
first child, a boy, died at the end of
six months. The second, a daughter,
was taken from me before it was a
year old. You are young, my friend
and cannot understand how afflicting
such losses are. A mother’s
heart, I assure you, is broken when
she sees her child taken from her,
however young it may be. My husband
himself was greatly distressed
when our little boy was carried off
after an illness of only a few hours.
But his grief was still more profound
when our little girl died. Dear child!
though only nine months old, her
face was full of intelligence, her eyes
were expressive, and she had a wonderful
way of making herself understood.
She passed quietly away,
softly moaning, and gazing at us with
affection. Her father held her in
his arms the whole time of her long
agony. It seemed as if he thus
hoped to retain her. She, too, was
sad, I am sure. She seemed to
know we were in grief, and to leave
us with regret. Her sweet face only
resumed its joyful expression after
her soul had taken flight for heaven;
then a celestial happiness beamed
from her features consecrated by
death. Victor stood gazing at her
a long time as she lay on the bed
with a crucifix in her innocent hands.
His lips murmured a prayer in a low
tone. It seemed to me he was addressing
our angel child&mdash;begging
her to pray that God would speedily
call him to dwell for ever with her
in his blissful presence. The thought
made me shudder. It seemed as if
I had at that moment an interior revelation.
I knew that was Victor’s
prayer, and I had a presentiment it
would be heard.</p>

<p>From that day, though we had a
thousand reasons to consider ourselves
happy, we were no longer
light-hearted as we once had been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
There was a something that weighed
on our minds and kept us anxious,
and empoisoned all our joys. Life
seemed unsatisfactory, and we drew
nearer to God. We were constantly
speaking of him and the angel who
had flown from us, and we often approached
the sacraments together.
It was thus that God was secretly
preparing Victor to return to him,
and me to endure so terrible a
blow.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="pc1">AN UNEXPECTED ASSAULT.</p>

<p class="p1">No man was ever more fond of
domestic life than Victor. The happiest
hours of the day were those we
all spent together&mdash;he, my mother,
my young sister, and myself&mdash;occupied
in some useful work, but often
stopping to exchange a few words.
It was with regret Victor sometimes
left us at such hours to mingle with
the world. He refused all invitations
to dinners, soirées, and balls as
often as possible, but he could not
always do so. He had taken the
first place&mdash;a place quite exceptional&mdash;in
local journalism, and it was impossible
for him to decline all the
advances made him. Besides, he
wished, as was natural to one of his
profession, to ascertain for himself
public opinion on the question of the
day. I cannot tell you how dull the
evenings seemed when he was away,
or how anxious I was till he returned.
There was something dreadful about
his profession. In vain he resolved
to avoid personalities; they were
often discovered when none had been
intended. If he was fortunately able
to keep within the limits he had
marked out for himself, and confined
himself to the defence of justice, morality,
and religion, he found these
three great causes had furious opponents.
Whoever defended them incurred
the ardent ill-will of the enemies
of all good. This is what happened
to Victor. Their secret hatred
burst forth on an occasion of but
little importance.</p>

<p>A renowned preacher of the South,
worthy in every respect of his reputation,
came to preach at the cathedral
during Advent. This man, as
eloquent as he was good, attacked
the vices of the day with all the ardor
of an apostle. Many of the young
men of the place who went to hear
him were infuriated at the boldness
of his zeal. Some supposed themselves
to be meant in the portraits he
drew of vicious men in a manner so
forcible and with such striking
imagery as to make his hearers
tremble. At the close of one of these
sermons, there was some disturbance
in the body of the church. Threats
were uttered aloud, and women
treated with insult. Victor, indignant
at such conduct, had the courage
to rebuke the corrupt young men
of the place. Never had he been
more happily inspired, and never had
he produced such an effect. The
article was everywhere read. It gave
offence, and we awaited the consequences.</p>

<p>The next day Victor received an
invitation to a large ball given by a
wealthy banker. The invitation surprised
him, for he knew the banker
was a liberal with but little sympathy
for the priesthood and its defenders.
I begged Victor to decline the invitation
politely. I feared it was only
a pretext to offer him some affront.
He gently reassured me by saying
that, though M. Beauvais was a liberal,
he had the reputation of being an
honorable man. “I am glad,” added
he, “to become acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
those who frequent the banker’s salon.
I shall probably find more than one
Christian among them,” as, in fact,
often happened.</p>

<p>When the night came, Victor went
away, leaving me quite uneasy, in
spite of all his efforts to reassure me.
I made him promise to return at an
early hour. I was beginning to be
anxious towards eleven, when all at
once there was a sound of hasty footsteps.
I sprang to the door&mdash;I
opened it&mdash;it was he. As soon as he
entered the room, I noticed he was
extremely pale. He vainly endeavored
to appear calm, but could not
conceal the agitation that overpowered
him.</p>

<p>“Victor,” I cried, “something has
happened!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not much. Somebody
tried to frighten me.”</p>

<p>“Are you wounded?”</p>

<p>“No, they did not wish to take
my life.”</p>

<p>“I conjure you to tell me frankly
what has happened.”</p>

<p>“Well, here are the facts: I had
left M. Beauvais’ house, where I was
politely received, and had gone two
streets, when I observed three men
walking swiftly after me on the
Place. They seemed well dressed,
which removed my suspicions. I
turned into the little Rue St. Augustine.
It is dimly lighted in the
evening and almost always deserted.”</p>

<p>“How imprudent!”</p>

<p>“That is true. I did wrong. I
had scarcely gone a hundred yards,
before the three men overtook me.”</p>

<p>“‘Stop!’ exclaimed one of them.
I stopped to ascertain what they
wished. The same voice continued
in these terms: ‘How much do
those <i>calotins</i> give you to defend
them?’</p>

<p>“‘I have only one word to say in
reply to your insulting question&mdash;I
defend my own principles, above all
because I cherish them in the depths
of my soul.’ So saying, I sought to
keep on my way.</p>

<p>“One of them detained me. ‘Before
going any further,’ said he who
seemed to be the spokesman, ‘swear
never to abuse the young men of this
town again!’</p>

<p>“‘I attack no one individually,’ I
replied. ‘Am I forbidden to defend
my own cause because it is not
yours?&mdash;But this is no time or place
for such an interview. It should be
at my office and by daylight. Come
to see me to-morrow, and I will answer
your questions.’</p>

<p>“The three men were so wrapped
up in their bernouses and large comforters
that I could not tell who they
were. I thought it time to disengage
myself from the grasp of the
one that held me. I made a violent
effort. In the struggle, my cloak fell
off. As I stooped to pick it up, I received
several blows. I then called
for assistance. Several windows in the
neighborhood opened. The three
cowards disappeared. As you see, I
am neither killed nor wounded. On the
whole, no great harm has been done.”</p>

<p>My whole frame trembled during
this account. When it was ended, I
became somewhat calmer, and, passionately
throwing my arms around
Victor, I begged him to promise me
solemnly never to go out again in the
evening. He did so willingly.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="pc1">VICTOR AT THE POINT OF DEATH.</p>

<p class="p1">The next morning Victor told me
he did not feel any effect from what
had occurred. He therefore went
to the office as usual, and wrote a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
spirited article, in which he made
known and energetically stigmatized
the base proceedings of those who
had attacked him. The article attracted
particular attention, and gave
us the pleasant satisfaction of realizing
to what a degree Victor had won
the good-will of upright men. On
all sides they came that very day to
express their indignation at the violence
used against him....</p>

<p>We should neither overestimate
nor decry human nature. There are
certainly a multitude of base men
with low natures and vile instincts.
But even among those who are the
farthest from the truth there are
some souls that have preserved a certain
uprightness and hearts of a certain
elevation for whom we cannot
help feeling mingled admiration and
pity.</p>

<p>That same evening Victor complained
of not being well, but kept
saying it was nothing serious. Without
asking his consent, I sent for a
physician, who examined him. Victor
was forced to acknowledge he
had been chilled the night before.
He was very warm when he left M.
Beauvais’ house, and, to counteract
the effect of the keen north wind, he
started off swiftly, and was in a complete
perspiration when overtaken by
his assailants. Stopped in the middle
of the street, he was exposed to
the cold night air, which was of
course injurious. What was still
worse, his cloak fell off, and it was
several minutes before he recovered
it.</p>

<p>I was seized with terror at hearing
these details. It seemed as if my
poor husband had just pronounced
his own death-warrant. At the same
time a horrible feeling sprang up in
my heart, such as I had never experienced
before. I was frantic with
rage and hatred against those who
were the cause of this fatal chill. I
begged, I implored Victor and the
physician to promise to take immediate
steps for their discovery, that
no time might be lost in bringing
them to justice in order to receive
the penalty they deserved.</p>

<p>“Agnes,” said Victor mildly&mdash;“Agnes,
your affection for me misleads
you. I no longer recognize
my good Agnes.”</p>

<p>But I gave no heed to what he
said, and was only diverted from my
hatred by the care I was obliged to
bestow on him. In twenty-four
hours my poor husband’s illness had
increased to such a degree that I lost
all hope. Poor Victor! he suffered
terribly, and I added to his sufferings
instead of alleviating them! I
loved him too much, or rather with
too human an affection. I afflicted
him with my alternate outbursts of
despair and anger.</p>

<p>“Live without you!” I would exclaim&mdash;“that
is impossible! Oh! the
monsters who have killed you, if they
could only die in your stead! But
they shall be punished and held up
to infamy as they deserve! If there
is no one else in the world to ferret
them out, I will do it myself!”</p>

<p>These fits of excitement caused
Victor so much sorrow that the very
remembrance of them fills me with
the keenest remorse&mdash;a remorse I
have reason to feel. His confessor,
the physician, my mother, and he
himself tried in vain to soothe me.
One told me how far from Christian
my conduct was, and another that I
deprived my husband of what he
needed the most&mdash;repose. I would
not listen to them. I was beside
myself.</p>

<p>One evening I was sitting alone
beside the bed of my poor sick one,
and was abandoning myself anew to
my unreasonable anger, when Victor
took my hand in his, and said, in a
tone that went to my very heart:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Agnes, I feel very weak. Perhaps
I have not long to live. I beg
you&mdash;I conjure you&mdash;to spare me the
cruel sorrow of having my last hours
embittered by a want of resignation
I was far from expecting of you!
Of all my sufferings, this is the greatest&mdash;and
certainly that to which I
can resign myself the least. What!
my dear Agnes, do you, at the very
moment of my leaving you, lay aside
the most precious title you have in
my eyes&mdash;that of a Christian woman,
a woman of piety and fortitude&mdash;which
transcends all others?...
What! are you unable to submit to
the will of God! Because his designs
do not accord with your views,
you dare say that God no longer
loves you&mdash;that he is cruel!...
My dear, do you set up your judgment
against that of God? Do you
refuse him the sacrifice of my life
and of your enmity?... Does not
my life belong to him?... And
is not your enmity unchristian?...
Did they who have reduced me to
this condition intend doing me such
an injury?... I think not. Could
they have done me the least harm if
God had not permitted them?...
No matter at what moment the fatal
blow falls on us, no matter whence
it comes, it only strikes us at the
time and in the manner permitted by
God.&mdash;Agnes, kneel here beside me,
and repeat the words I am about to
utter. Repeat them with your lips
and with your whole heart, whatever
it may cost you. It is my wish. It
is essential for your own peace of
mind, and also for mine. Agnes,
my dear love, we have prayed a
thousand times together and with
hearts so truly united! Now that you
see me ill, perhaps dying ... can you
refuse me the supreme joy of once
more uniting my soul with yours before
God in the same prayer?” ...</p>

<p>I burst into tears, and obeyed.</p>

<p>“O my God!” he cried, “whatever
thou doest is well done. Nothing
can tempt me to doubt thy
goodness. Is not thy loving-kindness
often the greatest when it seems
disguised the most?... I firmly believe
so, and I forgive all those who
have tried to injure me. I pray thee
to convert them. As for me, I beg
thee, O my God, to deal with me as
thou judgest most for thy glory and
for my good.”</p>

<p>Victor uttered these words with so
much fervor and emotion that I was
stirred to the depths of my soul. A
complete change took place within
me which I attributed to my dear
husband’s prayers. My eyes, hitherto
tearless, now overflowed. My anger
all at once disappeared. A profound
sadness alone remained, mingled
with resignation....</p>

<p>Victor’s life continued in danger
some days longer. Then&mdash;oh! what
happiness!&mdash;when I had made the
sacrifice and bowed submissively to
the divine will, the physician all at
once revived my hopes. To comprehend
the joy with which my heart
overflowed at hearing that perhaps
my husband might be restored to
life, you must, like me, pass through
long hours of bitterness in which you
repeat, with your eyes fastened on
your loved one: “A few hours, and
I shall behold him no more!”</p>

<p>A week after, Victor was convalescent.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="pc1">A PROVIDENTIAL EVENT.</p>

<p class="p1">Victor and I then entered upon a
singular life of which I think there
are but few instances. I felt from
the first that his convalescence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
deceptive, and the physician secretly
told him so. We both felt that God
allowed us to pass a few more months
together, but no longer. The disease
was checked, but it still hung about
my dear one. It assumed a new
form, and changed into a slow malady
that was surely accomplishing
its work. As frequently happens in
such complaints, Victor was but partially
cured of inflammation of the
lungs, and now became consumptive.</p>

<p>A great poet says that no language,
however perfect, can express all the
thoughts, all the emotions, that spring
up in the soul.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This is true. I
have often felt it, and now realize it
more than ever. Ten months elapsed
between Victor’s amelioration and
his death&mdash;months memorable for
great suffering, but which have left
me many delightful, though melancholy,
remembrances. I wish I could
impart these recollections to you. I
hardly dare attempt it, so conscious
am I of my inability to do them justice.</p>

<p>How, indeed, could I depict the
love, stronger than ever, that bound
me to my husband, spared in so unhoped-for
a manner, though but for
a brief period&mdash;so brief that I could
almost count the hours? How
make you understand how elevated,
superhuman, consoling, and yet sorrowful,
were our conversations?
How many times Victor said to me:
“Agnes, how merciful the good God
is! See, he could have recalled me
to himself at once, but still leaves
me with you a few months longer.
Oh! how heartily I desire to profit
by this time in order to prepare for
death, though I fear it not! I do
not wish to spend one of these last
hours in vain. I wish to do all the
good in my power, and love you better
and better as the blessed do in
heaven. Oh! how sweet it will be
to enter upon that perfect love
above, which we have imagined, and
had a foretaste of, here below&mdash;what
do I say?&mdash;a thousand times sweeter,
more perfect. Its enjoyment will be
without any alloy of fear or sadness,
for in loving, we shall have a right to
say: ‘It is for ever!’”</p>

<p>But of all the thoughts that occupied
Victor’s mind at that period,
that which was most constantly in
his heart he expressed in these simple
but significant words: to do all
the good possible! Penetrated with
this desire, he resumed his duties at
the <i>Journal</i> office as soon as he was
able. His talents had developed
under the influence of suffering.
Every one remarked it. But controversy
fatigued him, and he was not
able to go out every day. He was,
therefore, provided with an assistant&mdash;a
young man of ability, to whom he
could transfer most of the labor. He
took pleasure in training him for the
work, saying to himself: “He will
be my successor. I shall still live in
him, and have some part in the good
he will do.”</p>

<p>A part of the day, therefore, remained
unoccupied. He employed
these hours in writing a small work&mdash;a
simple, touching book, which was
published a short time before his
death, and is still doing, to my knowledge,
much good among the people.</p>

<p>Training his successor and publishing
a useful book were two good
acts he took pleasure in, but, so great
was his ardor for benefiting others,
that they did not suffice. He earnestly
longed for some new opportunity
of testifying to God how desirous
he was of making a holy use of the
last moments of his life. “And yet,”
he added, “I acknowledge this work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
is perhaps presumptuous. It is asking
a special grace from God of
which I am not worthy.” But God
granted him this longed-for opportunity
of devoting himself to his glory,
and he embraced it with a heroism
that won universal admiration.</p>

<p>Spring returned, and we fell into
the habit of going from time to time
to pass a day in the country with
Jeanne, my old nurse. Jeanne was
one of those friends of a lower condition
whom we often love the most.
There is no jealousy in such a friendship
to disturb the complete union
of soul. It is mingled with a sweet
sense of protection on one side, and
of gratitude on the other&mdash;which is
still sweeter.</p>

<p>We went there in the morning,
walked around awhile, then breakfasted
and resumed our walk.
Jeanne lived at St. Saturnin, six kilomètres
from town. It is a charming
place, as you are aware. Near the
village flows a stream bordered by
poplars and willows that overshadow
the deep but limpid waters. One
morning we were walking in the
broad meadow beneath the shade of
these trees, when suddenly we saw a
young man on the opposite shore,
not six rods off, throw himself into
the stream. Victor still retained a
part of his natural vigor. Before I
thought of preventing him, he
sprang forward, and, seeing that the
man who had precipitated himself
into the water did not rise to the surface,
jumped into the river, swam
around some time, and finally succeeded
in bringing the stranger to
shore. I was wild with anxiety and
grief. Without allowing him to stop
to attend to the person he had rescued,
I forced him to return to
Jeanne’s in order to change his clothing.
He gave orders for some one
to hasten to the assistance of the
poor man for whom he had so courageously
exposed his life. Several
persons hastily left their work, and in
a short time returned with the man
who had tried to drown himself.
He was still agitated, but had recovered
the complete use of his faculties.
At the sight of my husband in
the garb of a peasant, he at once comprehended
to whom he owed his life.
He was seized with a strange tremor;
he staggered, and seemed on the
point of fainting. Victor made every
effort to bring him to himself, and at
length succeeded. As soon as this
young gentleman, who was clad with
uncommon elegance, recovered his
strength and self-possession, he seized
my husband’s hand and kissed it
with a respect that excited strange
suspicions in my mind. Victor appeared
to know him, but I did not
remember ever having seen him before.
Why had he thrown himself
into the river? To drown himself,
of course.... Why, then, did he testify
so much gratitude and respect for
one who had hindered him from executing
his project?...</p>

<p>He requested, in a faint, supplicating
tone, to be left alone with Victor.
The rest of us withdrew into
the garden. At our return, Victor
whispered to me: “This gentleman is
Louis Beauvais, the banker’s oldest
son. He himself will relate his history
to you after our return home.”</p>

<p>The carriage was not to come for
us till four o’clock. We therefore
passed several hours together at
Jeanne’s. Victor devoted himself to
Louis with an attention that touched
me inexpressibly. As to Louis, a
son could not have shown more affection
to the best of fathers than he
to Victor.</p>

<p>The hour of our departure came at
last. We entered the carriage, and
were all three at home in half an hour.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c91" id="c91">HOME EDUCATION.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">As</span> the family is the type and basis
of society, so does it contain, as in a
microcosm, all the questions, problems,
and difficulties that agitate the
larger world. Marriage is first in importance
within the family and in
society, as representing the principle
of creation; education comes next,
as representing the principle of development.
Given a new and perfect
society, made up of individual
couples whose union should be absolutely
satisfactory, and whose motives,
thoughts, and actions absolutely
irreproachable, how is it to be perpetuated
in this desirable state? If
to the perfection of marriage were not
added the consequent perfection of
education, the new society, for a moment
raised up above former standards
of approximative goodness,
would, in the course of half a generation,
be reduced lower than any
standard of Christian times. This
is so well understood that education
has come to be the one cry of all
parties, representing with some the
conscientious result of their religious
belief, with others merely their ambition
to make a stir in the political
world. Christians look to it as
fitting men for heaven; statesmen
turn to it as fashioning the law-abiding
citizen; atheists see in it the
means whereby successfully to blind
mankind, and make them swallow the
poison hidden under the appearance
of superficial cleverness; the devil
grasps it as a tool, or recoils from it
as from a thunderbolt; but to no
thinking being can it be a matter of
indifference.</p>

<p>We do not propose to go into that
broader question of public education
which, once within the scope of the
law, and face to face with established
national systems, immediately
sets both hemispheres in a ferment;
but to discuss that preliminary and
more vital training whose silent
power shows itself every day in the
homes of thousands, neutralizing on
the one hand good examples and
wholesome teaching, and on the
other often redeeming from utter
badness its half-corrupted subject.
And first taking the literal meaning
of the word education, <i>i.e.</i> to <i>lead up</i>,
or <i>out of</i> (<i>e-duco</i>), we must remark
that as education is coeval with the
dawn of reason, so it is also continuous.
It begins in the cradle, and
goes on hand in hand with life to the
grave. All experience, good or bad,
is education, not only the lessons
taught in school-hours, the lectures
given in classes, halls, and colleges,
not alone the books we read and
the examinations we undergo, but,
more emphatically, the places we
frequent, the people we meet, the
misfortunes we go through, the
work we perform. Even prosperity
is education, though seldom in the
highest sense, but it is chiefly in the
lower walks of fortune that the more
important part of this daily and
hourly education is imparted. For
this reason specially, and in view of
the future in which a chance word
heard in the street or a stray visit
to some place or person may become
of such subtle and paramount
gravity, should home education in
the Christian sense of the word be
encouraged to the utmost. More
particularly should this be the case
in non-Catholic countries. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
no outward atmosphere of religion to
trust to; no wayside crosses to remind
us of the sufferings which our
sins caused our Blessed Saviour; no
simple shrines to bid us remember to
pray for our invisible brethren in
purgatory; no street processions to
bring vividly before our minds that
our King is more than an earthly
lord, and our Mother more than an
earthly parent.</p>

<p>We do not breathe Catholicity in
our daily life, and there is therefore the
greater need of our drinking it in
with our mother’s milk. This insensible
and gradual instilling of religion
into our infant minds is the
essence of Christian “home education.”
First among all the influences
that go towards it is example.
This extends over every detail of the
household, and can be and should be
kept in view in the poorest as well as
the most comfortable home. In
the latter, certainly, the duty is
more stringent, the incentives to its
performance lying so near at hand
that it requires an absolutely guilty
carelessness to neglect them. In the
former, though a thousand excuses
might be made for the neglect of this
paramount duty, it should still be
remembered that God’s grace is all-powerful,
and never fails those who
seek to do his will. Parents sorely
tried during a day of toil and anxiety
are often found more loving and forbearing
towards their helpless children
than others who, with no trouble
on their minds, yet delegate the “tiresome”
office of nurse to a hired attendant;
and although it is certainly to be
deplored that in so many cases the
children of the poor should be nothing
but little men and women already
weighed down by cares that
ought to belong only to a later age,
still it may be questioned whether
even this is not a lesser evil in the
long run than that other sort of neglect
which makes the children of the
rich, for the most part, only the playthings
of their parents.</p>

<p>The poor, on the contrary, though
necessity may make their children
drudges, yet have in them early
friends, while too often among their
more fortunate neighbors children
count only as the ornaments of the
house. So that even out of evil
comes good, and God has planted
consolations in the path of his poor
which go far to soften the miseries of
their inevitable lot. We say inevitable,
not as denying the immense, unexplored
possibilities of alleviating
this lot which remain in the power
of future philanthropists, but as believing
in our Lord’s prophecy, “The
poor you have <i>always</i> with you,”
which blessed promise we count as a
staff vouchsafed in mercy to help us
on our way to heaven.</p>

<p>We have said that the duty of good
example is incumbent upon every
parent, rich or poor. But not only
those broad examples which could
hardly fail to strike even an idiot,
such as abstaining from unseemly
brawls, from excesses of language and
of self-indulgence&mdash;in plain words,
from swearing and drinking&mdash;or from
manifest dishonesty; there are subtler
things than these, and which produce
indeed greater effect on the
child spectator. Gross vice has
often that redeeming phase of being
its own antidote by disgusting those
who come in daily contact with it.
The principle on which the Spartans
educated their children in temperance
by exhibiting before them
the drunken helots was (however
cruel its application on the persons of
their unhappy prisoners) a consummate
proof of practical wisdom.
That which does not carry such an
antidote with it is more to be feared
in the education of a child. A spirit
of irritability between husband and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wife; a carelessness on the part of
either in entering cordially into the
other’s little interests; an exhibition
of temper over absurd trifles or of
unamiability in small questions of
self-denial&mdash;these tell gravely upon a
child’s character. Observation and
criticism are childhood’s natural
characteristics, and very logical and
very pitiless are childhood’s judgments.
The old-fashioned code of
a “well-behaved” child used to be
never to ask questions; we are not
so sure that this code was faultlessly
wise. We suffer perhaps under a
somewhat aggravated form of a very
dissimilar one just now, and may be
tempted&mdash;not unpardonably&mdash;to wish
for the peace of the good old times
back again. As usual, the middle
course is the most rational as
well as beneficial, and if it were in
our power to stop the violent swayings
of the social pendulum from one
extreme to the other, we would gladly
do our part in the work.</p>

<p>It is therefore in the more unheeded
and less abnormal occurrences of
every day that the greatest force of
example lies, and that harm or good
may be done beyond recall. Christian
gentleness, that daily unobtrusive
charity which in rough homes
amply makes up for what outward
refinement may be lacking, and in
more prosperous households alone
sets the seal of true worth upon such
exterior polish as there is, is the
golden secret of a perfect example.
And this spirit should extend to
every domestic relation, covering the
whole field of contingencies which
may assume such grave proportions
in a child’s memory. Your deportment
to the poor, if you are rich yourself,
has an invaluable force of example;
the patience with which you
listen to a tale of distress, the delicate
courtesy implied in an attentive
attitude, the gracefulness of your
alms, and the wise but gentle discrimination
of your questioning, all have
an untold effect upon the little trotter
by your side, hardly old enough
to reason however dimly, but old
enough to bear away a nameless impression
of the scene. On the other
hand, think of the responsibility incurred
by a rude or callous reception;
a sneering or lofty air of caution
against what you think may be an
imposture; above all, perhaps, a careless
alms given to be rid of a disagreeable
importunity, and a half-expression
of relief when the interruption
is happily over! The child at
your side bears away this impression
quite as surely, and in after-years
uses its imitative powers quite as
skilfully, as if the impression had been
one of mercy and kindness; and a
very few scenes of this sort are
enough to mould for a child a certain
standard of behavior.</p>

<p>Among the domestic relations,
none is more likely to strike a child’s
eye than that between master and
servant. Here also dangerous
seeds of future heartlessness may be
easily sown by the example of a careless
or haughty parent. Considerate
thought for the proper comforts of
those whose toil ensures your leisure
is one of the foremost Christian duties.
A child is naturally tyrannical,
and this disposition, if fostered by
an injudicious mother, may lead to
a shameless persecution of the very
persons to whose care children are
most often left. This, in turn, will
encourage tyranny on the nurse’s
part, and engender a system of mutual
deceit; the child and the servant
trying to circumvent each other in
carrying tales, and then sheltering
themselves by lies from the consequences
of having carried them.
Now, all this is to the last degree injurious
to the future character of the
child; it withers the principle of honor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
it kills all manliness and straightforward
dealing, and sows the seeds
of those two inseparable vices, cruelty
and cowardice. In after-life, when
the despairing mother sees her darling
sink below himself, and earn the
unenviable names of bully and sneak,
can she blame him for shattering the
ideal she blindly worshipped in his
person? Not so, for with justice can
she look back on her own folly, and
with bitterness cry out, “<i>It was my
fault.</i>”</p>

<p>Very different is the other and
the good example shown by so many
holy and conscientious women in
their relations with their households.
Considerateness and forbearance in
all things are not incompatible with
firmness in some. A sense of your
own dignity, were it nothing higher,
will dictate a kind bearing towards
those in humbler station; for to those
who never obtrude their superiority
a double homage will ever be accorded.
A child can exercise on its attendants
some of the noblest virtues
of manhood; the household is a little
world, a preparatory stage on which
to rehearse in miniature the opportunities
of after-life. Pleasure given to
some, a little gift or a gracious
speech vouchsafed to others; consolation
afforded to one in grief, attention
shown to one in sickness; and,
above all, a mindfulness of not making
the yoke of servitude too galling
by restricting the natural and
proper diversions of those whom God
has destined to bear it&mdash;such are a
few of the lessons a child should
learn, not in words alone, but in the
manner of its parents and the unconscious
radiating of an habitual example.</p>

<p>Another class of influences under
which a child will necessarily come
is that of social relations. For the
most part, children are made too
much of a show. They are taught&mdash;or
allowed&mdash;certain little mannerisms
which, at their age, are called
charming, but, if looked at by the
light of common sense, are simply as
absurd as they are forward. Later
on, when they begin to use their
reason, they are often listeners to
frivolous or scandalous conversations,
in which they pick up, if not a half-knowledge
of vice, certainly a whole
love of gossip. Now, all this is deplorable
from a Christian point of
view. In a really Christian home&mdash;a
home such as we aspire to see at
least in every Catholic family&mdash;the
case would be very different. Entertainments
and fêtes would be judiciously
“few and far between,” and
in its mother’s visitors the child would
see only fresh objects of its mother’s
charitable tact. If anything against
charity were said, the hostess would
gently check the conversation, either
by palliating the fault alluded to,
suggesting a better motive than the
apparent one concerning any person
implicated, or turning the conversation
skilfully to some less dangerous
topic. Those formal visits, made to
kill time or otherwise uselessly, would
have no part in her day’s programme,
and with ever charitable but firm demeanor
would she effectually check
the frequent demands thus made
upon her time by others. The child,
quick of perception, as almost all
children are, would be unconsciously
moulded to habits of orderly and
discriminating hospitality, and would
soon learn to do something for God
in every social pastime which it legitimately
enjoyed.</p>

<p>This brings us to the subject of
order, an important virtue in the
Christian home. Education itself, if
given in a desultory fashion, would
be next to useless, and some of that
strict apportioning of time which
gives to our study hours their wholesome
monotony is essential also for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the home training of youth. This
may seem at first sight a very arbitrary
decision, but, when we come to
look deeper into it, we find that it
has the same relation to the future
moral life as the study of the classics
or of mathematics to the intellectual
life. A knowledge of the Greek and
Latin poets, orators, and historians
has perhaps very little influence on
the practical and ultimate result of a
college education; but the effect of
refinement it has on the mind, and
the polished tone it imperceptibly
gives to thought, manners, and conversation,
are benefits simply incalculable.
So with mathematics. A
boy may not have any aptitude for
that science, and may never hope to
become proficient in it; still, the habit
of application, the facility of concentrating
and commanding his thoughts,
which is the natural result of the
close study demanded by the exact
sciences, are things whose influence
on his future career cannot be rated
too high. They may not unlikely
ensure temporal success, and, in these
days of feverish competition, this
argument should not be overlooked.
Still, it is from a higher motive that
we say the same of habits of order
in the home. This regularity, which,
no doubt, may be tedious, just as
mathematics may be dry, is not lost
on the general impressions of childhood,
and, were it only for its own
sake, should be looked upon as a
seal of likeness to the works of God,
which cannot fail to hallow the family
circle. We have said that the
family is the world in miniature, and
as the principle of order was the
presiding attribute in creation, so
ought we in our daily lives to take
it as a means of creating more and
more time, more and more opportunities,
for the service of God. “Be
perfect, even as your heavenly Father
is perfect.”</p>

<p>In the education given by the constant
example of the parents, nothing
is more important than family prayer,
or, at least, prayer said at the mother’s
knee. In the most solemn of
duties, it is not fitting that parent
and child should be separated. If
Jesus has said that his Father can
refuse nothing to “two or three <i>gathered</i>
together in his name,” how
much more invincible must be the
joint prayer of those who are linked
by such close and sacred ties, those
who present to him a faint shadow
of his own humble home at Nazareth!
Think you that Jesus in his
kingdom forgets the simple hearth
where his Mother taught him, according
to the development of his human
nature, those formulæ of prayer and
thanksgiving which he himself, in his
divine nature, had taught to the Jewish
lawgivers? Does he forget the
rites of circumcision and presentation,
the offerings and ransom paid
for him according to the law, the
visit to the temple at Jerusalem?
He has shown us in his obedience to
these religious observances his wish
that we should imitate his outward
devotion and submission to the
church. Family worship is dear to
him in remembrance of his own
childhood, and as it is one of the
most solemn, so it is also one of the
sweetest duties of the Christian parent.
It tends to give the child a
proper spirit of faith and simple reliance,
in that it sees its earthly parent,
to whom it looks up for everything
and considers as the final arbiter of
its small world, prostrate before a
higher Fatherhood, and taking towards
the divine Omnipotence the
very attitude of a submissive and
expectant child.</p>

<p>Next to prayer itself, pious reading
cannot fail to demand our attention
as the second great spiritual help in
the routine of home education. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
should be simple and well suited to
the understanding of young children,
and, above all, should not be a dry
and barren formality, but should be
explained and amplified by the mother’s
comments. How, unless questions
are freely allowed&mdash;nay, encouraged&mdash;can
the extent of the impression
made by spiritual reading
be measured? Then, what an inexhaustible
resource does not this reading
or its equivalent&mdash;descriptions by
word of mouth&mdash;afford to a thoughtful
parent! The beautiful narratives
of the Old Testament, the stories of
the four gospels, the many striking
incidents in the lives of the saints,
the legends of the faithful middle
ages, the histories of the contemporaneous
manifestations of God’s mercy,
all offer mines of wealth to a
skilful narrator. If, instead of goblin
tales more fit for the entertainment
of rational people than for the staple
of a child’s too credulous meditations,
these holy histories became the
nursery rhymes of the future generation,
it would be well indeed for the
spiritual advance of our age. If
among the romances of mediæval
times more of those were chosen in
which religion figures than of those
where fairy and elf appear, it would
be a better promise for the future
health, moral and physical, of our
people. Who knows how much of
that nervousness which is the characteristic
disease of our day is due to
those unwholesome terrors of infancy,
those threats of bogy and ogre, with
which children are frightened into
silence or lulled into uneasy sleep!
The child who would be, in a manner,
the companion of the boy Jesus, of
the child Precursor, the infant Samuel,
the Holy Innocents, the children of
whom our Lord said, “Suffer them
to come unto me, and forbid them
not,” and of the many boy and girl
saints&mdash;S. Rose of Viterbo, S. Aloysius
Gonzaga, S. Stanislaus Kostka&mdash;would
be a far healthier and more
manly subject than the mental companion
of deformed sprites and forest
goblins. The young mind is so impressionable
that it is the greatest
possible mistake to let its first exercise
of reason spend itself on unrealities;
they are apt to take on an influence
not readily shaken off, and to
cumber the ground long after room
is needed for more serious growths
of thought. This may seem an exceptional
mode of proceeding, perhaps
an eccentric one, the contrary
having for so many ages held sway,
but we take leave to think that it has
reason, expediency, and religion on
its side.</p>

<p>To this great duty of example,
which ramifies itself as often as there
are distinct classes of influence, is
added the duty of vigilance. Parents
need not only the knowledge of what
to impart, but the instinct of what to
shun. As watchers over a citadel,
they have to guard against the masked
inroads of the enemy, and carefully
to sift their children’s surroundings,
whether social or domestic, lest
any taint should lurk in the association.
We have read somewhere in a
book of devotion that those who
carry great treasures in a frail vessel
naturally take the greater care as to
their gait and speed; they look well
to see if the road is level, or to avoid
its irregularities if it is not; they take
heed to keep their eyes and mind intent
on what they bear, so as to
bring it safe to its destination. Even
so does the mother carry in her hands
the priceless treasure of a human
soul, and her solicitude for its perfect
preservation from all taint or attack
should be little less than that of the
child’s Guardian Angel himself. If,
as we have just hinted, she should
choose with such scrupulous care
even the companions of his fancy, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
much the more should this judicious
censorship be extended to the real
companions of his studies or recreations.
Perhaps the influence of
childish association is even greater
than the mother’s own, and what the
latter may have laboriously sown
will be uprooted in a moment by the
former. Children’s minds, in indiscriminate
contact with each other, are
as powder and spark brought together;
if each had been kept until the
right moment, and applied in the
right way, we might have had an
illumination; as it is, we have a conflagration.
As childhood merges
into youth, the choice of a school
brings this question of companionship
into prominence. In a public
institution, it is not possible to admit
only children who come, well-taught
and docile-minded, from irreproachable
homes; the very aim and end of
the institution would thus be frustrated.
Nor is it possible for its parents, once
a child is admitted, to choose absolutely
who, among its many school-fellows,
shall be its special friends.
Much may be done in that way by
advice, tact, and prayer; still, guidance
falls far short of absolute choice.
It is therefore evident that the greater
care should be taken to choose the
school which in itself shall have the
greatest influence in moulding the character
of its scholars, and thereby in
transforming into fitter companions for
the new-comer those very children
who, <i>nolens volens</i>, must needs be his
everyday acquaintances. But the influence
of home does not cease with
the first day at school. Letters from
home, breathing the old atmosphere,
will carry the child back, week by
week, to his old associations, be they
good or bad; the holidays will bring
him again within the fascination of the
old circle, and occasional visits from
the companions of his early childhood
will complete the charm. Thus an infinite
amount of good, or a corresponding
amount of harm, may yet be done
after the home education period has,
strictly speaking, passed away.</p>

<p>And here is, perhaps, the best place
to touch upon the holy influence which
an elder brother or sister may exercise
on a younger one. This, one of the
most powerful means of good, is only
second to that of the parents themselves,
and may furnish a very beautiful
illustration of true and discerning
brotherly love. It is spiritual friendship
engrafted upon the stock of natural
affection, itself a noble virtue and
most sweet tie, which has often, even
in heathen times, produced great effects.
Under this figure of brotherhood
God has typified his union with
creatures; he made himself our Brother
through the incarnation; and
everywhere brotherhood is synonymous
with the dearest and purest fellowship.
Our brothers and sisters in
the flesh, especially if they are younger
than ourselves, are as much our
care and charge as they are of our parents;
and of this we have a striking
instance in the very first book of the
Pentateuch, and only a few years
after the sinless creation of Adam.
Cain’s defiant plea, “Am I my brother’s
keeper?” failed to meet with
God’s endorsement, but brought instead
the terrible answer that he
should be “a fugitive and a vagabond
upon the earth.” In the daily
companionship of brotherhood, this
scene is often re-enacted; souls are
slain by their own kindred, and the
world smiles and passes blindly on.
But God has set a mark upon the
murderer by which the devils know
him and kill him not, because they
know too well whose road he is even
now treading, and that in the last
day his mark shall be revealed to all.
Here is the dark side of that continuous
education which is as potently
at work in dens of shame and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
places of pleasant danger as it is in
Christian homes and schools. Here
is that nefarious education which neutralizes
or obliterates the happy past,
and leads our young men by tortuous
paths of gradual vice to the end of
many such deceptive panoramas&mdash;the
gallows or suicide.</p>

<p>False example, insidious promptings,
rash indulgences, intoxicating
freedom, wily friendship&mdash;through
these and many kindred forms, subtle
may be and proportionately dangerous,
the devil, in the person of your
brother or your seeming friend, leads
you on till the murder of Abel is
repeated, and the insolent excuse
flung back to heaven: “Am I my
brother’s keeper?”</p>

<p>The system of rewards and punishments
has much to do with the moral
training of youth. With regard to
this, we may startle our readers by
broaching views so different from
those time-honored ones that pretend
to find their sanction in the Biblical
rule, “Spare the rod, and spoil the
child,” as to seem heretical to good
old-fashioned, jog-trot parents.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> But
what if the Scripture itself were to
fail them? What authority have they
for understanding “the rod” in its
literal instead of its figurative sense?
The rod was, with the Hebrews, an
emblem of power: witness the miracles
of Aaron in Egypt, and the blossoming
of his rod when his supreme
authority was called in question by
the rebellion of Core. “The rod”
may therefore very plausibly be taken
as meaning parental authority, and
the text would thus imply nothing
more than a declaration that the <i>carelessness</i>
of the parent will be responsible
for the wrong-headedness of the
child. In this sense we prefer to
read this passage, and for this reason:
physical punishments and rewards
will be indissolubly associated in a
young child’s mind with his good or
bad actions, just as they are coupled
in the memory and instinct of a dog
with the various desirable or undesirable
things it has been taught or forbidden
to do. This produces a low
and degrading standard by which
moral actions are henceforward measured
by the child, and later on will
lead to the impression that the absence
of such tangible consequences
argues the right to do as he pleases, irrespective
of merely moral restraints;
whereas, if the rewards and punishments
meted out to him are of the
moral and intellectual order, his conception
of the principle of duty will
be abstract and independent. Childhood
has a natural leaning towards
deception; therefore truth should be
made not only prominent, but attractive.
To own a fault, and even to confess
it unasked, should be an understood
palliation of the fault itself;
whereas any attempt at concealment
should be treated as a far graver offence
than the action concealed. In
a word, the principle of Christian honor
should be the keynote of home
education, and any meanness should
be condemned as the most contemptible
of all faults. Sensitive as children
are to the slightest alteration of
manner in their regard, they would
feel keenly the silence and avoidance
which this plan presupposes in their
parents’ conduct towards them when
guilty of a dishonorable action, and,
by associating the idea of <i>wrong</i> with
that of <i>disgrace</i>, would very soon be
brought to a truer estimate of morals
than if wrong with them was only
the synonyme of <i>pain</i>. Again, the
system of physical punishment invariably
leads to defiance; it stirs up a
spirit of contradiction and sullenness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
which gradually encrusts the young
mind with the deplorable proof-armor
of ultimate indifference. We
need give but one example&mdash;a personal
one&mdash;of the immense superiority
of moral over physical punishment.
As a child, we were stubborn and
self-willed, and were frequently treated,
not exactly to corporal indignities,
but to threadbare schoolroom devices
for overcoming temper. Two or
three times it happened that, these
worn-out means proving as inefficient
as “water on a duck’s back,” fatherly
authority had to be invoked. It
always took one form&mdash;silence. For
a week there would be none of the
happy familiarities between father
and child, but, instead, a cessation of
the usual pleasant and indulgent intercourse,
and now and then a grave
look of displeasure as the culprit
would make some spasmodic and
despairing advance. This was the
only punishment which made the
slightest impression, and the keen
remembrance of it lasts to this day.
Sometimes, when we were older,
another variety was tried. Instead
of being, according to the old code,
starved on bread and water in a dark
closet, we were seated alone at a table,
while the rest of the family ate
together as usual; every dish was
ceremoniously brought up and served
at our solitary meal, and every servant
in the house was perfectly aware
of the cause; no one spoke or offered
us the least attention beyond the
ordinary formalities, and we were
treated half like a distinguished prisoner,
half like an excommunicated
person. The result was admirable,
prompt in the extreme, and certain
to ensure an unusually long term
of subsequent docility.</p>

<p>Rewards are no less important
than punishments. Of these, knowledge
and religious opportunities
should, in our idea, form the staple.
They are thus invested with a personal
interest to the child; they
come before him as things specially
concerning his own good behavior
and his parents’ appreciation of it.
For instance, the mother reads him
Scripture stories and the legends of
the saints; he listens with absorption,
and longs to read the book himself,
but the road through the alphabet
and spelling-book is uninviting.
Why not teach him through the
book itself? The illuminated capitals
will strike him by their beauty,
the pictures will lend force to the difficult
words, and help his memory to
connect them with the illustrated
subject. Instead of finding church
services an irksome interruption to
his games, he might be made to look
upon them as the highest rewards he
can obtain. For a well-learnt lesson
in catechism, he might be taught to
chant one of those immortal poems,
the Psalms; for proficiency in
Bible history, he might be taken to
some of the most picturesque of
our solemn ceremonies, and hear,
on the way, of the typical manner
in which it is connected with that
history; for an act of childish self-denial,
he might be allowed to serve
as acolyte at Mass. Even these rewards,
however, should not be injudiciously
multiplied, for familiarity
would beget irreverence,&mdash;the worst
stumbling-block that could be laid in
a child’s spiritual path. We think
that a Christian education in the
early days of childhood could go no
further in perfection than this&mdash;the
thorough identification of all happiness
with religion.</p>

<p>We have yet to speak of a detail
in household economy, which, in point
of interest, is one of the foremost.
Personal attention to a child is a
part of the mother’s duty of vigilance,
and the fashionable custom of
leaving such attention to domestics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
cannot be reprobated too strongly.
This personal care is, first of all, an
instinct of nature which it must require
a very thick coating of frivolity
entirely to supersede; and it is, secondly,
a duty of religion from which
even great physical sickness cannot
conscientiously release the parent.
Numberless evils flow from a neglect
of this imperious duty. The forsaken
child will learn in time to forget
its mother, to think of her as a
splendid being very far from him&mdash;one
not to be annoyed by his cries
or made nervous by his romps, but
to be gazed at from afar, like a grand
picture or work of art. Happy child
if an affectionate, compassionate
nurse takes the vacant place of his
own mother, and makes him familiar
with those sweet, nameless trivialities
that make up the world of a child’s
heart; but, even so, how sad the
necessity for such comfort! How
much more sad, then, the position of
the unloved child, neglected even by
its nurse, or left to the well-meaning
but questionable petting of the other
servants! They will not be reticent,
though they may be obsequious, and
the future character of their charge
will be warped beyond remedy.
Pride, too, will be ridiculously fostered,
and will drive tenderness
away; a certain recklessness will be
infused into the child’s habits, and
reverence, refinement, sensitiveness,
will be petrified within him. He
will feel himself of no value, since no
one cares for him, and, if no happy
influence stops his downward course,
he will be a cynic before he is twenty-five.</p>

<p>We have said so much in this
strain, and made so much of the
gloomy side of the question, that we
feel bound to speak a little more
fully of the model Christian home,
not only as it should be, but&mdash;thank
God that we can say it!&mdash;as it very
often is. We know that, according
to Father Faber’s beautiful expression,
“God has many Edens in this world,”
and surely among our Christian
homes many deserve this name.</p>

<p>There are those in which the father
is not absorbed in business and
the mother by fashion, where the servants
are happy and attached members
of the family, where daily
prayer and cheerful work alternate
with each other in order, where recreation
does not degenerate into riot,
nor work conduce to moroseness.
Healthy exercise and early hours
keep the doctor from the door, while
constant industry repulses the proverbial
visitor who always “finds
mischief for idle hands to do.” The
father is the genial companion of his
children, and does not lose their respect
by gaining their confidence;
the mother is the guardian spirit of
the household, the wise woman of the
Proverbs, “whose children rose up
and called her blessed; her husband,
and he praised her.” Towards each
other the husband and wife behave
as they would before the angels of
God, because they remember that
he who scandalizeth “a little one”
is accursed, and that the angel of
“the little one,” who is there continually
beside him and in some sort
represents him in heaven, “beholds
the face of the Lord.” The children
are submissive, not through fear, but
through <i>reason</i> and love; for the acknowledged
superiority of their elders
has a rational force with them, and
they think themselves honored in
obeying those who are wiser than
they. They have Jesus of Nazareth
ever before their eyes&mdash;the Boy who,
as he grew in years, “waxed strong
in wisdom and grace,” and who,
though he was God, “went down,
and was subject to them.”</p>

<p>This life, peaceful, orderly, religious,
the life of the cloister translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
into the home, is in itself education.
Its holy influence is not confined
to space or time, but will live
in the hearts of the scattered family
through youth and manhood to extreme
old age. In fancy, they will be
able to reconstruct that home; in spirit,
to revisit it long after its dearest inmates
shall have left it for their heavenly
home, long after its material
frame shall have passed away to other,
perhaps to careless, hands. In their
various resting-places, whether a new
home, the daughter of that shrine,
or only a rock just above the level
of the sea of fortune, the hallowed
remembrance will come back to them
freighted with hope and strength for
the future. Even in heaven, the Son
of God is called Jesus of <i>Nazareth</i>,
and can <i>we</i> forget the home and
the mother that made us what we
are?</p>

<p>In all that pertains to this ideal,
although man is bound to subserve it
to the utmost, woman is more
solemnly pledged to its fulfilment.
Man has the world for his empire:
woman has man&mdash;during the years of
his pupilage. The mother’s education
is the child’s second birth, and she
who, being mother to the body of her
child, neglects that more laborious
training which accompanies its moral
development, practically refuses to
be the mother of its soul. To a woman
failing in her home duties is attached
more reproach than to a neglectful
husband and father, because
her office is the more sacred, her position
the nearer to God. It was a
woman who was glorified by the
most miraculously close union with
God that the universe has ever seen,
and by that standard alone should
womanhood and motherhood be
judged. If it falls short of a faint
copy of Mary the mother of Jesus, it
is condemned, for the state that has
been the most divinely exalted should
ever after remain the most humanly
perfect.</p>

<p>The mere temporal importance of
home education, though secondary
to its spiritual aspect, cannot be overlooked.
Besides the duty of the angel&mdash;training
souls for heaven&mdash;woman
has the duty of the citizen, <i>i.e.</i>
training patriots for the state. Without
faith there is no love of country
in the highest sense; without discipline,
no love of law. It is woman’s
task to mould the men who, in the
future, will mould the nation. High
or low it matters not: the mother
of the statesman and the mother of
the laborer work alike towards their
country’s glory. The state needs hands
as well as heads, and the mason who
cuts the common stones has as much
part and should have as much pride
in the completed building as the artist
who carves the wonderful pinnacles or
fashions the marvellous capitals.</p>

<p>We have spoken perhaps too exclusively
of the duties and circumstances
of the higher classes in this
matter of home education. Perhaps
it is not altogether unprovidential
that we should have been led to do
so; for of the various divisions of humanity
which our Lord in his parable
of the sower represents under the
figure of the different accidents that
befell the good seed, we know which
is, unhappily, the least productive.
Jesus himself has explained that the
thorns which choked the seed are the
“cares, and riches, and pleasures of
this life.” Mark well, the <i>cares</i>; not
only the riches and pleasures, for
those self-sought and profitless cares
have not the blessings on them which
the God-given cares of poverty have.
The poor and lowly too often shame
their more fortunate brethren by their
greater self-devotion and generosity.
Their homes, so much less prosperous,
are yet often so much more edifying,
than ours; and let it be remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that every act of theirs has, according
to the measure of their inferior
opportunities, double the merit of any
similar act of ours. So with the
wholesome reticence which becomes
us who have so many opportunities
<i>and neglect them</i>: we have preferred to
point out the beam that is in our own
eye, rather than pharisaically to expatiate
on the mote that is in our
neighbor’s. Yet we would not that
any class should deem itself exempt
from the duties of home education&mdash;duties
which, with the poor, have all
the added merit of absolute heroism.
The poor are told, and doubtless
truly, by our teachers and superiors,
that their condition should be dear
to them because it was that of our
Lord himself; but we, their brethren
and fellow-pilgrims, should labor to
supplement this teaching by making
that very condition less irksome to
them. Who can dream of Jesus on
earth as <i>not</i> being poor and destitute?
But, on the other hand, who
would dare, were he now on earth,
to be behindhand in ministering to
his poverty? Now, the alms we <i>owe</i>
to his earthly representatives are twofold,
<i>i.e.</i> spiritual and temporal.
Among the former, none are so meritorious
as good examples. Have we
not in these days a perpetual and
most sadly grotesque picture of class
aping class, of tawdriness following
close on the heels of fashion, of aspiring
vanity actually crowding out
the legitimate needs of the body?
If this system of imitation must be,
why not give it a worthy subject to
practise upon?</p>

<p>Reform, to be practical, must begin
in the higher strata of society; for not
only to individuals, but also, in a
wider sense, to classes, is the keepership
of brotherhood entrusted. We
<i>are</i> our “brother’s keeper,” and our
“brother” is the mass of men who
look up to us for guidance. As long
as our fathers and husbands care
more for their office than their home,
so long will the bulk of the nation be
mere animated machines snatching
after precarious wealth; as long as
our wives and mothers care more for
the drawing-room than for the nursery
and study, so long will the mass
of women be heartless coquettes or
abandoned harlots. We speak strongly,
because we feel strongly. This is
an age of initial struggle, which our
faith should turn into an era of better
things. If we need any “new departure,”
let it be the departure from
frivolity to domesticity, from contemptible
weakness to the manliness
of the Gospel. And here let us say
one word to the head of the family,
to him without whose example even
the mother’s influence is incomplete.
Business is <i>not</i> the whole of life; it is
<i>not</i> even the first earthly good to be
sought for. Success often kills happiness,
and its exclusive pursuit always
kills peace. The father who allows
business to isolate him from all the tenderer
interests of his home achieves
two things: he alienates his children’s
affection&mdash;after having very likely worn
out his wife’s devotion&mdash;and he teaches
them betimes the baneful lesson
that before Mammon all other interests
must bow. This false doctrine
his children will teach to theirs by an
example equally gloomy with his
own, and thus God will be forgotten
in the very gifts which one word of
his mouth could turn in a moment to
dust and ashes.</p>

<p>Shall this be so, or will Christian
parents take heed to their duty?</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid">A CANADIAN LEGEND.</p>

<p class="pc1">FROM THE FRENCH OF M. L’ABBE CASGRAIN.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;THE MISSIONARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Reader</span>, have you ever been in
the old church of the Rivière Ouelle?
In one of its side-chapels is an <i>ex-voto</i>
which was placed there many
long years ago by a stranger who
was miraculously preserved from
death. It is a very old picture, full
of dust, and of no artistic value, but
it recalls a touching story; I learned
it when very young, on my mother’s
knees, and it has remained as fresh
and vivid in my memory as when I
first heard it.</p>

<p>It was a cold winter evening, long,
long ago. The snow was beating
against the window-sashes, and the
icy north wind howled and shrieked
among the naked branches of the
great elms in the garden. The
whole family had assembled in the
<i>salon</i>. Our mother, after playing
several airs on the piano, allowed her
fingers to wander restlessly over the
keys&mdash;her thoughts were elsewhere.
A shade of sadness passed over her
brow. “My dear children,” said
she, after a moment’s silence, “see
what a fearful night this is; perhaps
many poor people will perish before
morning from cold and hunger.
How thankful we ought to be to
God for our good food and warm,
comfortable beds! Let us say our
rosary for the poor travellers who
may be exposed to such dangers during
the night.” And then she added,
“If you say it with devotion, I
will tell you all a beautiful story.”
Oh! how we wished that our rosary
was finished! At that age the imagination
is so vivid and the soul so impressionable.
Childhood possesses
all the charms of the golden dawn of
life; enveloping every object in shade
and mystery, it clothes each in a poetry
unknown to any other age.</p>

<p>We gathered around our mother,
near the glowing stove, which diffused
a delicious warmth throughout
the apartment, and listened in a religious
sort of silence to her sweet and
tender voice. I almost think I hear it
now. Listen with me to her story:</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the last century,
a missionary, accompanied by
several Indians, ascended the south
bank of the St. Lawrence River,
about thirty leagues below Quebec.
The missionary was one of those
intrepid pioneers of faith and civilization
whose sublime figures are
thrown out from the dark background
of the past, surrounded by
a halo of glory and immortality.
Nailed on Golgotha during the days
of their bloody pilgrimage, they
shine to-day on a new Tabor; and
the light which radiates from their
faces illuminates the present and
throws itself far into the future. At
their names alone, the people, seized
with wonder and respect, bow low
their heads; for these names recall a
courage most superhuman, a faith
most admirable, and a devotedness
most sublime. He whom we are following
at this moment was one of
those illustrious children of the Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of Jesus, whose entire life was
consecrated to the conversion of the
savages of Canada. He was not
very tall, and stooped slightly; his
beard, blanched prematurely by hardships,
and his pale and attenuated
features, seemed to indicate a want
of strength and endurance for so hard
a life; but this frail body concealed
one of those grand souls which draw
from the energy of their will an inexhaustible
strength. His large, expansive
forehead suggested a proportionate
intellect, and his features
wore an expression of incomparable
sweetness and simplicity; the least
shade of a melancholy smile played
over his lips&mdash;in a word, his whole
face seemed filled with that mysterious
glory with which sanctity illumines
her predestined souls.</p>

<p>The leader of the little band was a
few steps in advance. He was an
old Indian warrior who a long time
before had been converted to Christianity
by this holy missionary, and
who from that time became the faithful
companion of all his adventurous
wanderings.</p>

<p>The travellers advanced slowly on
their <i>raquettes</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> over a soft, thick
snow. It was one of those superb
December nights whose marvellous
splendor is entirely unknown to the
people of the South, with which the
old year embellishes its waning hours
to greet the advent of the new-comer.
Innumerable stars poured their light
in silver tears over the blue firmament
of heaven&mdash;we might say
tears of joy which the glory of the
Sun of Justice draws from the eyes
of the blessed. The moon, ascending
through the different constellations,
amused itself by contemplating
in the snowy mirror its resplendent
disk. Toward the north, luminous
shafts radiated from a dark cloud
which floated along the horizon.
The aurora borealis announces itself
first by pale, whitish jets of flame
which slowly lick the surface of the
sky; but soon the scene grows more
animated, the colors deepen, and the
light grows larger, forming an arch
around an opaque cloud. It assumes
the most bizarre forms. In
turn appear long skeins of white silk,
graceful swan-plumes, or bundles of
gold and silver thread; then a troop
of white phantoms in transparent
robes execute a fantastic dance.
Now it is a rich satin fan whose
summit touches the zenith, and
whose edges are fringed with rose
and saffron tints; finally, it is an
immense organ, with pearl and ivory
pipes, which only awaits a celestial
musician to intone the sublime hosanna
of nature to the Creator. The
strange crackling sound which accompanies
this brilliant phenomenon
completes the illusion; for it is
strangely like the sighs which escape
from an organ whose pipes are
filled with a powerful wind. It is
the prelude of the divine concert
which mortal ears are not permitted
to listen to. The scene which presented
itself below was not less fascinating
in its savage beauty than
that of the sky above.</p>

<p>The cold, dry atmosphere was not
agitated by a single breath; nothing
was heard but the dull monotonous
roaring of the gigantic river, sleeping
under a coverlet of floating ice,
which dotted its dark waters like the
spotted skin of an immense leopard.
A light white vapor rose like the
breath from the nostrils of a marine
monster. Toward the north, the
blue crests of the Laurentides were
clearly defined, from Cape Tourmente
to the mouth of the Saguenay.
In a southern direction the last slopes
of the Alleghanies stretched along,
covered with pines, firs, and maples;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
almost the entire shore was densely
wooded, for at the remote period
which we describe those vast clearings
along the banks covered with
abundant meadows were not to be
seen, nor the pretty little whitewashed
houses grouped in villages along
the shore so coquettishly, a person
could easily compare them to bands
of swans sleeping on the river-banks.
A sea of forest covered these shores.
A few scattered houses appeared
here and there, but this was all.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;THE APPARITION.</h3>

<p>The travellers advanced in silence
toward the middle of the wood, when
suddenly the leader of the party
stopped, making at the same time a
sign with his hand for his companions
to do likewise. “You are mistaken,
comrade,” said the missionary
to him; “the noise that you have
just heard was only a tree split by
the frost.”</p>

<p>The Indian turned slowly toward
him, an almost imperceptible smile
passing over his face. “My brother,”
said he, in a low voice, “if you saw
me take your holy word,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and try to
read in it, you would laugh at me.
I do not wish to laugh at you, for
you are a black-gown; but I tell you,
you do not know the voices of the
forest, and the noise which we have
just heard is a human voice. Follow
me at a distance, while I go
on to see what is happening yonder.”
The travellers walked on for some
time without seeing anything. The
father began to think he had not been
deceived, when they came to an opening
in the woods, and saw the Indian
stop. What was his astonishment,
when, following the direction in
which the savage was looking, he
saw at the extreme end of the opening
a very extraordinary light, apparently
detached from the obscurity
of the trees. In the midst of this
luminous globe appeared a vague,
indistinct form, elevated above the
ground. Then another spectacle
that the brilliancy of the strange vision
had prevented him from seeing
before, was presented to his gaze.</p>

<p>A young man dressed in military
uniform was kneeling at the foot of
a tree. His hands were clasped and
his eyes turned towards heaven; he
seemed absorbed in the contemplation
of a mysterious and invisible
object. Two corpses, which were
easily recognized as an officer and a
soldier from their uniforms, were
lying by his side in the snow. The
officer, an elderly man with gray
hair, was lying against a maple; in
his hands was a little book, about to
slip out of them. His head was
leaning on his right shoulder, and his
face had that ashy hue which too
plainly told that death already
claimed him. A bluish circle surrounded
his half-closed eyes, and a
last tear stood congealed on his
livid cheek. A placid smile was on
his face, indicating that a supreme
hope, which faith alone could inspire,
had consoled his last moments.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The noise made by the travellers’
feet in the snow caused the young
man, who was still on his knees, to
turn suddenly round. “O father!
my father!” cried he, rushing toward
the missionary, “it is Providence
who has sent you here to save me.
I was about to share the terrible fate
of my unfortunate companions, when&mdash;a
prodigy!&mdash;a miracle!”&mdash;suffocated
by his tears and sobs, he could
say no more, but, throwing himself
into the arms of the missionary, he
pressed him to his heart.</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, my dear son,” said
the old man; “for in your feeble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
exhausted state such violent emotion
might prove fatal.” Scarcely had he
finished the words, when he felt the
young man’s head sink heavily on
his shoulder, and his body become a
dead weight&mdash;he had fainted.</p>

<p>The travellers eagerly bestowed on
him every care that his situation required
and that lay in their power.
His two friends, alas! were beyond
reach of human succor. The savages
dug their graves in the snow,
and the saintly missionary, after reciting
some prayers over their bodies,
cut with his knife a large cross in the
bark of the maple at the foot of
which they had breathed their last&mdash;a
simple but sublime monument of
hope and love, destined to guard
their earthly remains.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;A CANADIAN HOME.</h3>

<p>See you yonder, on the slope of
the hill, that pretty cottage, so neat
and white, with its little thatched
barn, so clearly defined against the
caressing foliage of that beautiful
copse of maples? Well, that is a
Canadian home. From its high
green pedestal it smiles at the great
rolling river, in whose wave is mirrored
its trembling image, and which
so gently comes to expire at its feet;
for the happy proprietor of this
pretty dwelling loves his great, beautiful
river, and has been careful to
establish his home on its banks.
Sometimes, when necessity obliges
him to go away, he is always homesick,
because he must listen to its
grand voice, and contemplate its
wooded islands and distant shores;
he must caress with his eyes its
waters, sometimes calm, sometimes
foaming and turbulent. A stranger
who is not familiar with the <i>habitant</i>
of our country, and who imagines
that there is an affinity to his ancestor&mdash;the
peasant of old France&mdash;is
much mistaken. More enlightened,
and, above all, more religious, he is
far from sharing his precarious condition.
The former is, in comparison,
a veritable prince; perfectly independent
on his sixty or eighty arpents
of land, surrounded by a cedar enclosure,
he is furnished with everything
necessary for an honest and
comfortable subsistence.</p>

<p>Let us now peep under this roof,
whose exterior is so attractive. I
should like to sketch it just as I’ve
seen it so frequently. On entering
the <i>tambour</i>, or passage-way, two
pails of fresh water, standing on a
wooden bench, and a tin cup hanging
against the wall, hospitably invite
you to quench your thirst. In an
inner room the mother of the family
is quietly spinning near the window,
while the soup is boiling on the
stove. A calico cape, a blue skirt
of domestic manufacture, a <i>caline</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
neatly fixed on her head, completes
her toilet. The baby sleeps in its
cradle at her side; from time to
time she smiles at its bright little
face, as fresh as a rose, peeping out
from the quilt, whose triangular
patches of the brightest colors are
ingeniously distributed over it. In a
corner of the room the eldest daughter
sits on a chest, singing merrily,
while she works at her loom; quickly
and skilfully the shuttle flies between
her hands; she makes in a day several
measures of cloth, which she will
use next year to make into garments.
In another corner stands the huge
bed, with its white and blue counterpane,
and at its head a crucifix surrounded
with pictures. That little
branch of withered fir above the
cross is the blessed palm. Two or
three barefooted little urchins are
playing on the floor, harnessing up a
dog. The father, bending over the
stove, gravely lights his pipe with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
firebrand. He is accoutred in a red
woollen cap, vest and pants of a
grayish material, and rough, heavy
boots. After each meal he must
“take a smoke” before going out to
plough or to thresh in the barn.
There is an air of thrift and comfort
about the house; the voices of the
children, the songs of the young
girl, with her spinning-wheel accompaniment,
the appearance of health
and happiness written on their faces,
tell of the peace and serenity of
their lives.</p>

<p>If ever, in travelling through this
country, you are overtaken by a snowstorm
or severe cold, go and knock
without fear at the door of the Canadian
cottager, and you will be received
with that warmth and cordiality
which their ancestors have
transmitted to them as a souvenir
and a relic of the Old Country; for
this antique French hospitality, which
can scarcely be found now in certain
parts of France, seems to have
taken refuge under the roof of the
Canadian <i>habitant</i>. With his language
and religion, he has piously preserved
many of his old habits and customs.
The traveller who rested under his
roof a century ago would to-day
find the same manners and characteristics.</p>

<p>It is in the parish of the Rivière
Ouelle, in the bosom of one of these
good Canadian families, that we find
again our missionary and his companions.
All the family, eager to hear
the extraordinary adventures of the
young officer, had gathered round
him. He was a young man, from
twenty to twenty-five years of age,
with fine, delicate features; his dark
wavy hair fell over and partially
shaded his high forehead, and his
proud glance revealed the loyalty of
the French soldier; but an extreme
pallor, consequent on the fatigue and
privations he had undergone, had
left a touching and melancholy expression
on his face, while his refined
and finished manners told of an
equally finished and careful education.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;THE SILHOUETTE.</h3>

<p>“More than a month ago,” said
the young officer, “I left the country
of the Abnakis, accompanied by
my father, a soldier, and an Indian
guide. We were bearing very important
dispatches to the governor
of the colony. We travelled along
through the forest for several days
without any accident, when, one
evening, overcome with fatigue, we
lit a fire and camped for the night
near an Indian cemetery. According
to the custom of the savages, every
corpse was wrapped in a shroud
of coarse bark, and placed high
above the ground on four stakes.
Bows and arrows, tomahawks, and
some ears of maize were hung
against these rude graves, and shook
and rattled as the wind passed over
them. Our own savage was seated
just in front of me, on the half-decayed
trunk of a pine-tree that had
fallen to the ground, and seemed
half buried in profound meditation.
The fitful flames of the fire threw a
weird light over his gigantic frame.
An Indian might readily have compared
him to one of the superb maples
of our forest, had he been able at
the same time to have united with it
the cunning of the serpent and the
agility of the elk. His height was increased
by a quantity of black, red,
and white feathers tied with his hair
on the top of his head. His ferocious
features, piercing black eyes, his
tomahawk and long knife, half concealed
by the trophy of scalps which
hung from his belt, gave him a wild
and sanguinary appearance. The
night was dark and bitter cold. The
low and unequal arch formed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
interlacing branches of the trees, and
illuminated by the flickering light of
our pine-wood fire, seemed like a
vast cavern, and the old trunks of
the rotten trees, which were buried
in the snow, looked like the corpses
of giants strewn around. The birches,
covered with their white bark, seemed
like wandering phantoms in the
midst of this <i>débris</i>, and the dull
rumbling of the distant torrent, and
the wind moaning and whistling
through the leafless branches, completed
the weird funereal aspect of
the place. Any one slightly superstitious
could easily believe he heard
the sighing spirits of the Indian
warriors who lay buried so near us.
In spite of myself, a shiver of horror
ran through my veins. Here, in the
midst of all this grim rubbish, where
every rock and tree was transformed
by the shadows into as many
spectres watching his movements; our
audacious savage appeared as grave
and tranquil as if he had been in
his own cabin.</p>

<p>“‘Comrade,’ said I to him, ‘do
you think we need fear any danger
still from those Iroquois whose trail
we discovered yesterday?’</p>

<p>“‘Has my brother already forgotten
that we found it again this morning?’</p>

<p>“‘But there were only two,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘ Yes; but an Iroquois can very
quickly communicate with his comrades.’</p>

<p>“‘But these were not on the war-path;
they were hunting an elk.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes; but the snow is deep, and
they could soon kill him without much
fatigue, and then&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘Well!’</p>

<p>“‘And then, their hunger once satisfied&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘Finish!’</p>

<p>“‘I say they might, perhaps, amuse
themselves by hunting the whiteskins.’</p>

<p>“‘But the whites are at peace with
the Iroquois.’</p>

<p>“‘The Iroquois never bury but half
of the war-hatchet; and, besides, they
have raised the tomahawk against the
warriors of my tribe, and if they
discover the track of an Abnakis
among yours&mdash;’</p>

<p>“‘You think, then, that they might
pursue us? Perhaps it would be
more prudent to extinguish our fire.’</p>

<p>“‘Does not my brother hear the
howling of the wolves? If he prefers
being devoured by them to receiving
the arrow of an Iroquois, he
can extinguish it.’</p>

<p>“The words of our guide were not
very reassuring, but I was so overcome
with fatigue that, in spite of the
evident danger to which we were exposed,
I fell asleep. But my sleep
was filled with the wildest dreams.
The dark shadow of our guide, that
I saw as I went to sleep, seemed to
lengthen and rise behind him, black
and threatening, like a spectre. The
dead in the cemetery, shaking the
snow from their shrouds of bark, descended
from their sepulchres, and
bent towards me. I fancied I heard
the gritting of their teeth as the wind
rushed through the trees and the dry
branches cracked and snapped. I
awoke with a start. Our guide, leaning
against a post of one of the graves,
was still before me, and from his
heavy and regular breathing I knew
that he slept profoundly. I fancied
I saw just above him, peeping over
the grave against which he was leaning,
a dark form and two fixed and
flaming eyes. My imagination is
excited by my fantastic dreams,
thought I, and tried to compose
myself to sleep again. I remained a
long time with my eyes half shut, in
that state of semi-somnolence, half
watching, half sleeping, my stupefied
faculties scarcely able to discern the
objects around. And yet the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
shadow seemed to move slightly, and
to lean more and more towards our
savage, who was still in a deep sleep.
At that moment the fire suddenly
blazed up, and I saw distinctly the
figure of an Indian. He held a long
knife between his teeth, and, with
dilated eyes fixed on his enemy, he
approached still nearer to assure himself
that he slept. Then a diabolical
smile lit up his face, and, seizing his
knife, he brandished it an instant in
aiming a blow at the heart of his victim.
The blade flashed in the firelight.
At the same moment a terrible
cry rang out, and the two savages
rolled together in the snow. The
flash of the steel, in awakening our
guide, had also betrayed his enemy.
Thus my horrible nightmare terminated
in a more horrible reality. I
had hastily seized my gun, but dared
not fire, lest I should kill or wound
our guide. It was a death-fight between
them. The snow, streaked
with blood, blew up around them like
a cloud of dust. A hatchet glittered
in the air, then a dull, heavy sound,
followed by the cracking of bones.
The victory was decided. A gurgling
sound escaped from the victim&mdash;it
was the death-rattle! Holding in
one hand a bloody scalp, the conqueror,
with a smile, raised himself
proudly. At that instant a shot was
heard. A ball struck him in the
breast, and our savage, for it was he,
fell dead in front of the fire. Taking
aim with my gun, and sending a ball
in the direction whence the shot had
come, and where I saw another shadow
gliding among the trees, was for
me the work of an instant. The Indian,
with a terrible death-cry, described
an arch in the air with his
body, and fell dead to the ground.
The tragedy was finished; our savage
was avenged, but we had no longer
a guide. I then thought of our conversation
that evening, and how his
apprehensions of the two savages
whom we had tracked in the morning
had been so fearfully realized.”</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;DEATH.</h3>

<p>“Abandoned, without a guide, in
the midst of interminable forests, we
were in a state of extreme perplexity.
We hesitated a long time whether to
proceed on our route or retrace our
steps. The danger of falling into the
hands of the Iroquois, who infested
that part of the country, decided us
to continue our journey.</p>

<p>“The only means left of finding our
way was a little compass which my
father had fortunately brought along.
Several days later found us still on
our painful march, in the midst of a
violent snowstorm. It was a veritable
tempest; the snow fell so thick
and fast we could scarcely see two
feet in advance.</p>

<p>“In every direction we heard the
trees splitting and falling to the
ground. We were in great danger
of being crushed. My father was
struck by a branch, which completely
buried him under the snow, and
we had great difficulty in extricating
him. When we raised him up, he
found that the chain around his neck
which held the compass was broken,
and the compass had disappeared.
We searched long and carefully, but
in vain&mdash;it could not be found. In
falling, my father received a severe
injury on the head. While dressing
the wound, which bled freely, I
could not restrain my tears on seeing
this old man, with his white hair, enduring
intense suffering with so much
fortitude, and displaying such calmness
in the midst of an agony which
he tried to conceal from me by an
outward show of confidence. ‘My
son,’ said he, when he saw my tears,
‘remember that you are a soldier. If
death comes, it will find us on the
roll of honor. It is well to die a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
martyr to duty; besides, nothing happens
except by the will of God. Let us
submit at once with courage and resignation
to whatever he pleases to send.’</p>

<p>“We marched two days longer in
an intense cold, and then my father
could go no further. The cold had
poisoned the wound in his head, and
a violent fever came on. To crown
our misfortunes, our little store of
matches had become damp, and it
was impossible to kindle a fire.
Then all hope abandoned me, and,
not having been able to kill any
game for the past day or two, we
had been almost entirely without
food; then, in spite of all my warning
and advice, the soldier who accompanied
us, exhausted by fatigue
and hunger, and utterly discouraged,
went to sleep in the snow, and, when
I found him some time after, he was
dead&mdash;frozen stiff! Overcome by
the most inexpressible grief, I remained
on my knees by the side of
my dying father. Several times he
besought me to abandon him, and
escape death. When he felt his last
hour approaching, he said, handing
me an <i>Imitation of Christ</i> which
he held in his hand, ‘My son, read
to me.’ I took the book, and opened
it at chance, reading between my
sobs: ‘Make now friends near God,
in order that, after leaving this life,
they will receive you in the eternal
tabernacles.’<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> ‘Conduct yourself on
earth as a traveller and a stranger
who has no interest in the affairs of
the world. Keep your heart free
and raised toward God, because
here below you have no substantial
dwelling-place. You should address
to heaven every day your prayers,
your sighs, and your tears, in order
that, after this life, your soul will be
able to pass happily into the bosom
of our Lord.’</p>

<p>“I replaced the book in his hand.
A smile of immortal hope passed
over his countenance, for these lines
were a <i>résumé</i> of his entire life.
After a moment’s silence, he said:
‘My son, when I shall be no more,
take this little gold cross which
hangs around my neck, and which
was given to me by your mother on
the day of your birth’&mdash;there was a
moment’s silence. A shade of profound
sadness passed over his face,
and, taking my two hands in his, he
added, ‘Your poor mother!&mdash;oh! if
you live to see her again, tell her I
died thinking of God and of her.’
Then, making a supreme effort to put
aside this painful thought, at which
he feared his courage might fail him,
he continued: ‘Always wear this little
cross in remembrance of your father.
It will teach you to be faithful to your
God, and to your country. Come
nearer, my son, that I may bless you,
for I feel that I am dying.’ And
with his faltering hand he made the
sign of the cross on my forehead.”</p>

<p>At these words the young man
stopped. Large tears rolled down
his cheeks as he pressed to his lips
the little gold cross which hung on
his breast. All around him remained
silent, in respect to his noble grief,
but their tears flowed with his. Sorrow
is so touching in youth! We
cannot see, without a pang, the bright
flowers which adorn it wither and
fade away. The missionary was the
first to break the silence. “My son,”
said he, addressing the young man,
“your tears are legitimate, for the
cherished being for whom you weep
is worthy of them; but do not weep
as those who have no hope. He
whom you have lost now enjoys on
high the recompense promised to a
life devoted to sacrifice and duty.”</p>

<p>“But, oh! my father, if only you
could have been with him to console
his last moments!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>After a pause, he continued: “I
pressed my father for the last time
in my arms, and imprinted a last
kiss on his pale, cold forehead. I
thought at this moment he was dying.
He remained immovable, his eyes
turned towards heaven, when suddenly,
as if by inspiration from above,
he said, ‘I wish you to make a vow
that, if you succeed in escaping with
your life, you will place a picture in
the first church which you reach on the
road.’ I promised to do as he desired.
Some moments after, a few
vague and incoherent words escaped
his lips, and all was over.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">VI.&mdash;The Vision.</span></h3>

<p>“How long I remained on my
knees beside my father’s corpse I
cannot tell. I was so utterly overwhelmed
by grief and sorrow that I
was plunged in a kind of lethargy
which rendered my soul insensible
to everything. Death, the loneliness
of the forest, terrified me no longer;
for solitude dwelt in my heart, where
so short a time before all was bright
and joyous. Dreams, illusions&mdash;those
flowers of life that I have seen
fall leaf by leaf, to be swept away by
the storm; glory, happiness, the
future&mdash;those angels of the heart who
so lately entranced my soul with
their mysterious music, had all departed,
veiling with their drooping
wings their sorrowful faces. All
had gone&mdash;all. Nothing remained
but a void, a horrible nothingness.
But one feeble star watched yet in
the midst of my night. The faint
lamp of the inner sanctuary was not
entirely extinguished; there came a
ray from its expiring flame. Remembering
the vow that my dying
father had desired me to make, I
invoked with a sort of desperation
the Blessed Virgin, Comfortress of
the Afflicted; and behold, suddenly&mdash;but
can I tell what took place within
me? Human words are inadequate
to unveil the mysteries of God. I
cannot explain, human ears cannot
comprehend&mdash;yes, suddenly, in the
midst of my darkness, my soul trembled,
and a something seemed to
pass through me like an impetuous
wind, and my soul was carried over
the troubled waters; then, rapid as
the lightning that flashes through the
storm-cloud, a light appeared in the
darkness, in this chaos&mdash;a dazzling,
superhuman light&mdash;and the tempest
was appeased within me; a wondrous
calm had entered my soul, and
the divine light penetrated its most
remote recesses and imparted a delicious
tranquillity and peace, but
such a peace as surpasses all comprehension;
and through my closed
eyelids I saw that a great light was
before me. O my God! dare I tell
what happened then? Would it not be
profane to weaken thus the marvels
of your power! I felt that something
extraordinary, something supernatural,
was taking place around
me, and a mysterious emotion, a holy
terror, that every mortal should feel
at the approach of a Divine Being
seized me. Like Moses, my soul
said within me, ‘I will go and I will
see this grand vision’; and my eyes
opened, and I saw&mdash;it was not a
dream&mdash;it was a reality, a miracle,
from the right hand of the Most
High. No; the eye of man has
never seen, nor his ear heard, what
was permitted that I should see and
hear then. In the midst of a cloud
of dazzling light, the Queen of heaven
appeared, holding in her arms the
divine Child. The ineffable splendor
that enveloped her form was so brilliant
that in comparison the sun is
only a dim star; but this brilliancy,
far from fatiguing the sight, refreshed
it deliciously. Twelve stars formed
her crown, the colors of the rainbow
tinged her robes, while under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
her feet were clouds which reflected
the colors of aurora and the setting
sun, and behind their golden fringing
myriads of angels were smiling
and singing hymns which have no
echo here below. And what I saw
and heard was so real that all that
I had heard and seen heretofore
seemed like a vague, dark dream of
night. The divine Virgin looked
at me with an immortal smile, which
was reflected no doubt from the lips
of her divine Child on the day of his
birth.</p>

<p>“She said to me: ‘Here I am,
my son. I come because you called
me. The help that I sent you is very
near. Remember, my son&mdash;’ But,
oh! what was I going to say! I am
only permitted to reveal a few words
of this celestial conversation, which
relate to my deliverance. The rest
is a secret between God and myself&mdash;sufficient
to say these words have
fixed my destiny.</p>

<p>“For a long time she spoke to me,
and my soul, ravished, absorbed,
transfigured, listened in unspeakable
ecstasy to the divine harmony of her
voice. It will vibrate eternally in
my soul, and the torrents of tears
that poured from my eyes were as
refreshing as dear to my heart. At
last the mysterious vision gradually
vanished. Clouds, figures, angels,
light, all had disappeared, and yet
my soul invoked the celestial vision
by ineffable sighs and moans.</p>

<p>“When at last I turned round, the
help which had been miraculously
promised to me had arrived. ‘Twas
then, reverend father, that I perceived
you near me. You know the rest.”</p>

<p>The next day there was great
excitement among the little population
of the neighborhood. The
news of the miracle had spread
rapidly, and a pious and devout
crowd had gathered in the modest
little church to assist at a solemn
Mass celebrated by the holy missionary.
More than one pitying look
was turned during the ceremony
toward the young officer, who knelt
near the sanctuary, praying with an
angelic fervor.</p>

<p>It is said that some time after, in
another country, far, far beyond the
sea, a young officer who had
miraculously escaped death abandoned
a brilliant future, and consecrated
himself to God in a cloister.
Was it he? No one has ever known
positively.</p>

<p>If ever you pass by the old church
of the Rivière Ouelle, don’t forget to
stop a moment. You will see hanging
in one of the side-chapels the
antique <i>ex-voto</i> which recalls the
souvenir of this miraculous event.
The picture has no intrinsic value;
but it is an old, old relic, that one
loves to see, for it tells a thrilling
story. Often travellers who come
from distant lands stop before this
dusty old picture, struck by the
strange scene it represents. Oftentimes
pious mothers stand before it
with their little ones, and relate to
them the wondrous legend; for the
souvenir of this thrilling story is still
vivid throughout the country.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c113" id="c113">THE RECORDS OF A RUIN.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Palais Royal derives its chief
historical interest from its association
with the memory of Cardinal Richelieu.
When it first attracted his notice
by its situation, at once delightful
and convenient, surrounded by
richly planted gardens, and close to
the Louvre and the then fashionable
thoroughfare of the city, it was the
property and residence of the Marquis
d’Estrée. From this nobleman
Richelieu purchased it in 1624.
Soon, however, the elegant mansion,
which had been abundantly spacious
for the lords of d’Estrée with their
innumerable retainers and long corteges
of valets of every degree in the
lengthy domestic hierarchy of those
days, became too small for the growing
importance of Louis XIII.’s magnificent
minister.</p>

<p>Richelieu fell a conquest to the
building and decorating mania prevalent
at that period amongst princes
and princely prelates; he threw
down the walls of the Hôtel d’Estrée
at the north end, pushed the house
into the gardens, drove the gardens
further out into the open space beyond,
and pierced a way through
into the street which was henceforth
to be honored by bearing his name.
Philippe of Champagne was invited
to paint the ceilings and decorate the
walls of the stupendous eminence
whose cipher gleamed over all the
doors, sometimes engrained in gold
letters upon marble, sometimes curiously
interlaced with emblematic
figures, or emblazoned in the Richelieu
arms. When all was complete,
it was necessary to rechristen the
dwelling which had been so enlarged
and renovated as to be virtually a
new edifice&mdash;the mansion which had
been metamorphosed into a palace.
After much serious consultation, and
many times changing his mind,
Richelieu decided that it should be
called Palais Cardinal. A slab bearing
these two words in large gold
letters was accordingly placed over
the gates of the <i>ci-devant</i> Hôtel
d’Estrée. The next morning all Paris
beheld it, and burst out laughing.
The <i>beaux-esprits</i> of the sarcastic
capital, with Balzac at their head,
rushed in a body to the square in
front of the new palace, and woke
the echoes of the sleeping aristocratic
gardens with their uproarious mirth;
there they stood, armed with grammars,
lexicons of divers tongues, and
pens and portfolios, discussing with
much solemnity the two inoffensive
nouns on the marble slab; every now
and then a wag from the crowd raising
shouts of laughter by some ludicrous
explanation of his own. Presently
the gates were swung apart, and out
drove the cardinal, and beheld the
spectacle, so eminently gratifying to
his sensitive pride, of “all Paris
laughing at him.”</p>

<p>The scoffers gathered round his
equipage, books and pen in hand, imploring
him to enlighten their ignorance
from the depths of his unfathomable
erudition; how were they
to parse the name of his eminence’s
house? <i>Palais</i> and <i>Cardinal</i>&mdash;it
was most perplexing to their weak
intelligence. The conjunction was a
turning upside down of all established
rules&mdash;a topsy-turvy of principles
and of all known precedents.</p>

<p>Separately, the two nouns were
comprehensible, but joined together,
what were they? Was it, mayhap,
Greek or Latin construction, or was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
it taken from the legends of old Gaul
French, or a specimen of some new
and unknown tongue evolved from
the universal genius of the minister?
Richelieu, writhing under the pitiless
hilarity of the tormentors, lent a deaf
ear to them, and rode forth in scornful
taciturnity; petitions from imaginary
savants, who professed to be laboring
in the mazes of a new grammar,
flowed in the following days upon
the unlucky author of the ungrammatical
inscription, beseeching him
to let the ignorant world into the secret
of its proper parsing; the enemies
of the cardinal, in fact, made
capital out of his vanity to their
heart’s content, but Richelieu’s pride
was a match for them. The only
answer he condescended to make
was to point to the inscription over
the Hôtel Dieu. The precedent was
no doubt unanswerable; but vanity
remained, nevertheless, more prominent
in the imitation than either
sense or grammar. It held its place,
however, in spite of all attempts to
laugh it down. The splendors of the
Palais Cardinal have been enlarged
upon in most of the memoirs and
chronicles of that time. Richelieu,
while busy making and mending
quarrels between the king and the
queen-mother, Marie de Medicis,
governing France, and pulling the
strings of all the governments of Europe,
found time to devote to his
hobby of enriching and beautifying
his palace, overseeing in its most
minute details the architectural part
of the work, and directing the research
after objects of art far and
near for its adornment. While he
was thus variously occupied, a knot
of literary men were in the habit of
meeting quietly once a week close to
his palace gates, to read aloud their
own works, and discuss the state of
letters, whose horizon was just then
beginning to brighten under the rising
sun of the great Corneille. The
meetings were held at the house of
one of the circle; they were quite
unostentatious, and aspired to no notoriety
beyond their own circle; the
members sought only to encourage
each other by honest criticism, and
by the emulation that comes of working
in common towards a common
end. Soon, however, these weekly
gatherings became talked about;
courtiers heard of them, and begged
to be allowed to assist at them. By-and-by
Richelieu came to hear of
them; his curiosity was excited, first
from a political point of view&mdash;he
feared the so-called <i>réunions littéraires</i>
might be a covert for something
more dangerous; he was not slow,
however, to find out his mistake, and
to detect in the modest literary club
a germ of future greatness; he expressed
his desire that the meetings
should be held henceforth at the
Palais Cardinal, and under his immediate
auspices. The members protested;
they were not worthy of so
distinguished an honor, etc.; but
Richelieu assured them that he saw
in their modest labors the promised
fulfilment of his long-cherished desire
“to raise the French language
from the ranks of barbarous tongues,
and to cleanse it from the impurities
which it had contracted in the mouth
of the people and on the lips of courtiers.”
The little band of writers
yielded reluctantly to the pompous
summons so flatteringly sent forth
against their independence, and the
Académie Française was founded.
Louis XIII. gave it letters-patent,
and became its chief patron, while
Richelieu was named President.
The number of academicians was
limited to forty. Amongst the great
and gifted men who figure at the
birth of this modern Areopagus, destined
to be glorified in its after-career
by so many brilliant members, Pierre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Corneille stands out conspicuous.
The young poet found in Richelieu a
kind and munificent patron, until he
had the ill-luck to wound his vanity
in one of its most vulnerable points.
Not content with being a potentate,
a warrior, a financier, and innumerable
other things besides, the insatiable
cardinal aspired to being a poet&mdash;a
disastrous form of ambition which
gave a cruel handle to his enemies,
and furnished them with many a
shaft of ridicule wherewith to
pierce his thin-skinned susceptibilities.
Richelieu, however, pursued his
way in serene self-confidence, despising
the ignorance and jealousy of the
vulgar herd, and periodically bringing
forth the offspring of his genius in
the shape of plays and poems. One
set of verses with which he was particularly
satisfied he handed in MS.
to Corneille, desiring to secure his
approval before launching them on
the sea of public criticism, and modestly
requesting the young poet to
overlook them and make any alteration
that he thought advisable. Corneille
had not graduated long enough
in the school of courtiers to know
what this flattering request was
worth, so he set about complying
with it conscientiously, pruning and
altering with his fine critical pen as it
ran along the course of the ministerial
poem. Richelieu’s amazement
on beholding his masterpiece thus
audaciously overhauled was only
equalled by his indignation. Corneille,
instead of falling on his knees
and crying <i>peccavi</i> when he saw his
mistake, proceeded with infantine
<i>naïveté</i> to argue the case with the
wrathful poet, and prove to him that
every correction had been called for
by some glaring fault. This did not
mend matters. Such insane honesty
met with the fate it deserved&mdash;the
fate that from time immemorial it
has met with in similar circumstances.
The scene between Gil
Blas and the bishop was enacted in
the library of the Palais Cardinal between
Corneille and Richelieu, and
certainly Gil Bias was not more astonished
by the effect of his candid
criticism on the bishop’s long-winded
sermon than was the young academician
by the thunderbolt which fell
from his patron’s brow on perusing
his MS. revised and corrected. He
was dismissed peremptorily, and
withdrew cursing his own stupidity,
and vowing that never again would
he be entrapped into the folly of believing
in the common sense of a patron.
Shortly after this mishap, while
wandering about in listless pursuit
of an object at Rouen, his native
place, he fell in accidentally with a
gentleman who had read his first
poetic efforts, and discerned through
their faults and trammels the promise
of true genius that lay beneath.
“Why do you waste and hamper
your talent in the threadbare conventionalities
of French art?” inquired
M. de Chalan. “You want a higher
and a wider scope; read Guillen de
Castro, and there you will find a
subject worthy of you, and which
will bring out your powers with a
fire and force unsuspected by yourself.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I am not acquainted
with Spanish,” replied the young
man.</p>

<p>“But I am,” returned M. de
Chalan, “and, if you like, I will teach
it to you.”</p>

<p>Corneille, having nothing else to
do, accepted the proposal, and
to this chance circumstance the
world apparently owes <i>The Cid</i>.
That masterly composition came upon
the dramatic world of France&mdash;hitherto
fed on threadbare conventionalities,
as de Chalan had well said&mdash;like a
revelation, and raised such a tempest
of senseless vituperation and malignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
opposition as has no parallel
in the history of literary cyclones.
Richelieu, who was far too good a
judge not to see the rare merits of
the poem, had not the magnanimity
to proclaim his opinion, and thus
quell the storm, but fell in with the
rioters, and was one of the loudest in
crying down the new tragedy. He
could not forgive the young poet
who, without his patronage, nay, in
spite of his own disgrace, had succeeded
in climbing to the topmost
round of the ladder. Corneille’s star
rose steady and clear above the
stormy waters, and he lived to see it
shine out in glorious lustre through
the clouds of envy and hostile criticism.
His career was one of unparalleled
triumph, till the appearance
of his last work, <i>Pertharite</i>,
written in 1653. It was played on
the boards of the Palais Cardinal
theatre, that had echoed to so many
of his previous triumphs, and was received
with a coldness that was
equivalent to condemnation. Corneille
saw in this isolated defeat the
ruin of his poetic fame; he became
possessed by a morbid despair, flung
away his lyre, and gave up the
theatre in disgust. During the interval
of depression that followed
this fancied humiliation, he devoted
himself to the translation of Thomas
à Kempis’ <i>The Imitation of Christ</i>,
sacrificing, as he said himself, “his
own reputation to the glory of a
sovereign author.”</p>

<p>The Palais Cardinal, during Richelieu’s
multifarious reign, was the
theatre of many boisterous scenes,
dark intrigues, and events otherwise
important than these literary skirmishes
that occasionally engage the
thoughts of ambitious statesmen.
Its propinquity to the Louvre enabled
him to keep his lynx eyes on the
busy hive of friends, foes, and tools
who gathered round the king; to
frustrate the petty plots of courtiers;
and forestall the schemes of faction
by his ubiquitous presence. Nor are
comic chapters lacking in the annals
of the Palais Cardinal at this period.
One related by the sprightly Duchesse
de Chevreuse, in a letter to Mme. de
Motteville, is grotesque enough to be
worth recording, as characteristic of
the cardinal and the court. Richelieu,
it was said, had dared to raise his
eyes to the queen, then in the full
bloom of her youth and beauty. As
might be expected, the unwarrantable
presumption inspired Anne of Austria
with no gentler feeling than contempt,
not unmixed with disgust.
She gathered up her purple robes, as
she might have done at the touch of
a viper, and shook them, and passed
on with a shudder and a shrug. But
her volatile friend, Mme. de Chevreuse,
whose <i>rôle</i> was fun at any
price, thought the cardinal’s love too
good a joke not to be turned to account.
She proposed playing him a
trick which would have the double
advantage of giving herself and her
royal mistress an hour’s good fun,
and of making Richelieu, whom she
hated with a woman’s inventive hate,
appear thoroughly ridiculous. “Let
me tell him from myself,” she entreated,
“that your majesty is only
inexorable because you do not believe
in the sincerity of his love; but
that, if he can give you proof of it,
you are open to conviction. I will
propose that he come here by the
private way, dressed as a harlequin,
and dance the saraband before you
one of these evenings, assuring him,
if he does this, you will believe in
the reality of his protestations.” Anne
was young, her life had not much
sunshine in its splendor, and the
demon of frolic which so madly possessed
her friend was not without its
power over her. She consented that
the outrageous joke should be played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
off on her gloomy swain. The
duchess accordingly informed him
that the queen was passionately fond
of the saraband, and had often expressed
a desire to see it danced by
one whose dignified deportment and
elastic figure were so admirably
adapted to bring out the peculiar
characteristics of the spirited and
stately dance, and that nothing would
gratify and flatter her more than to
see his eminence yield to this fancy.
It was necessary, she added, that he
should be dressed as a harlequin, in
order to bring out in all their perfection
the picturesque points of the
dance. Richelieu bit at this outlandish
bait, and it was agreed on a given
night he would roam to the Louvre,
and disport himself in the aforesaid
manner for the edification of the
queen, he being alone in one room,
while her majesty looked on at the
performance from behind a screen in
an adjoining one; a musician, concealed
also from view, was to accompany
the performance on the violin.
The duchess, who had not bargained
for her own share in the sport, took
care not to be deprived of it, but
stood beside the queen, peeping
through the screen, while the haughty
statesman, bedizened in the variegated
costume of harlequin, “with
bells on his fingers, and bells on his
toes,” and jingling from his comical
fool’s cap, tripped it on the light fantastic
toe. Mme. de Chevreuse describes
the scene with the mischievous
glee of a schoolboy: herself and
the queen squeezing each other’s
hands, and terrified lest one explosive
burst should betray them and suddenly
cut short the performance; the
musician convulsed in another corner,
scratching away frantically at his
fiddle to drown the irrepressible
laughter of the trio; while Richelieu,
the proud, the grave, the vindictive
and all-powerful Richelieu, capered
backwards and forwards on the
polished floor, snapping his fingers
at each rapid <i>pirouette</i>, stamping
his heel and pointing his toe as
the figures of the saraband demanded.
The performance over, he
donned his cloak, and made his
way back discreetly to the Palais
Cardinal. No time was lost in recapitulating
the farce to the court,
and the merriment that it provoked
may be readily imagined. But who
might laugh with impunity at Richelieu?
The true motive of the
unseemly burlesque to which he
had lent himself was soon made
known to the hero, and terrible
was the vengeance that awaited
its authors. He bided awhile, and
then began that series of calumnies
and persecutions that poisoned
so many years of the young queen’s
life. Richelieu had insinuated himself
into the confidence of Louis XIII.,
and his influence over him was
boundless. This tremendous weapon
he used against the queen with cruel
ingenuity. He contrived to implicate
her in the odious and diabolical
conspiracy of the arch-traitor de
Chalais; accused her of having plotted
to dethrone and murder the king,
with a view to putting Gaston d’Orléans,
his brother, on the throne, and
marrying him. When Louis XIII.
brutally challenged his wife to vindicate
herself from the twofold criminal
charge, she replied, with <i>spirituelle</i> disdain:
“I had too little to gain by
the exchange.” It is more than
probable that Louis never seriously
suspected Anne of Austria of having
had any share in the guilt laid to her
charge by Richelieu; but the calumny
did its work efficiently in another
way: it cut at the root of her affection
for her husband and of his trust
in her&mdash;it chilled and alienated them
for years. The Duchesse de Chevreuse,
accused, with some show of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
truth, of having conspired with Gaston
d’Orléans to dethrone the king, was
exiled from France. Richelieu followed
up the advantage of his first
attack by accusing the queen of keeping
up a correspondence with the
enemies of the state. Anne, too
proud to justify herself, imprudently
paraded her contempt for Richelieu’s
malevolent intrigues by openly and
on every occasion showing her love
for her own family, at that time at war
with France; expressions full of the
warmth of natural affection were
made a handle of by her enemies,
construed into treason against the
king and the state. The birth of
Louis XIV. (1638) brought about a
partial reconciliation between her and
the husband who had insulted and
treated her with systematic neglect.
But Richelieu’s sway remained unshaken
to the end. It was entirely
an intellectual sway; the heart had
no share in it on either side. The
minister hated the king, and the king
hated the minister; their natures
were essentially antagonistic, and
mutual interest alone held them together.
Louis, hearing that he was
about to be freed from the bondage
under which he had chafed so long&mdash;that
the summons had come for
Richelieu&mdash;went in haste to the Palais
Cardinal to receive the adieux of the
dying minister. The interview between
them was short and utterly devoid
of pathos; no shade of tenderness
had entered into the bond that
was about to be dissolved. The
breaking up of it was simply a matter
of business. The king left the death-chamber
of the man to whom he
owed all the glory of his reign, without
a tear in his eye or a passing emotion
in his heart, and paced the adjoining
room with a steady step and satisfied
air, while a smile, amounting at intervals
to a suppressed laugh, was visible
on his features. When all was over,
and the signal came forth that Richelieu
was no more, he exclaimed
tranquilly: “<i>Voilà un grand politique de
mort!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> (1642.) A few months later,
he himself had joined the great politician
in another world.</p>

<p>Richelieu, whose more than royal
munificence of state had roused the
jealous susceptibilities of the king,
atoned for it by bequeathing his
beautiful palace, with its accumulated
treasures of art and industry, to his
unthankful master. Anne of Austria
inaugurated her reign as regent by
taking up her abode under the roof
of the man who had been to the last
day of his life her implacable enemy.
Immediately after the death of Louis
XIII., she came to the Palais Cardinal
with the little king and his brother,
the Duc d’Anjou. The theatre on
which Richelieu had lavished so
much taste and wealth was included
in the bequest, though he had often
expressed his intention of presenting
it to the nation, and endowing it for
the benefit of rising dramatic artists.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that Anne of Austria
had good reason to execrate the
cardinal for his injustice and malignity
to herself personally, she did full
honor to his merits as a statesman;
and years after his death, when at the
zenith of her popularity as regent,
she said once, looking up at a portrait
of Richelieu which hung in the
state-saloon of the Palais Cardinal:
“Were that man alive now, he would
be more powerful than ever.” It was
a generous and exhaustive tribute to
the memory of those services which
had consolidated the monarchy in
France, and made her own position
what it was.</p>

<p>The name of Palais Cardinal,
which, despite its equivocal grammar,
was appropriate while Richelieu inhabited
it, ceased to be so when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
passed into the possession of the
crown. Anne was advised to change
it, but refused to do so, at the solicitation
of the Duchesse d’Aiguillon,
who besought her to retain a name
which so honorably associated Richelieu
with the glorious reign of Louis
XIII. Public opinion, however,
prevailed before long, and the palace
was henceforth by common consent
designated as the Palais Royal.
With its new name began a new era
in its annals.</p>

<p>Anne has been compared by some
of her admirers and biographers to
Blanche of Castille; but, while rendering
full justice to the queenly
qualities of the Austro-Spanish regent,
we own that the comparison
strikes us as being suggested rather
by their circumstances than by the
characters of the two queen-mothers
who each played so remarkable a
part in the history of their epochs.
Blanche of Castille made it her first
and paramount ambition to render
her son worthy of that imperishable
crown which awaited him in the
Kingdom that is not of this world:
Anne of Austria aimed at securing
for hers the supremacy of earthly
glory&mdash;at making him a great and
powerful king. In each case, as it
mostly happens, the omnipotent mother’s
will worked out its own ideal.
The minority of the future Grand Monarque
opened in troubled times; the
elements of the Fronde were fermenting
deep down under the apparently
smooth surface, and the <i>fêtes</i>, and
masquerades, and merry-making with
which the regent celebrated her
tardy accession to sovereign power
were soon followed by more exciting
events. Mazarin had succeeded to
Richelieu&mdash;oily, pliant Mazarin, so
zealous in his endeavors to keep well
with all parties; flattering the ambitious
hopes of Gaston d’Orléans, and
laying himself out with elaborate zeal
to please the regent and secure her
confidence; yielding outwardly, with
alluring grace, to every caprice of her
soft despotic sway; and pulling dexterously
the complicated strings of
the malcontents, Condé, and Conti,
and Longueville, and many other illustrious
personages who chafed uneasily
under the sceptre of the foreigner;
benevolent and outspoken,
but irreclaimably despotic. Mazarin,
in his desire to please all parties
whom it was of use to propitiate,
and make money plentiful where it
was needed for his purposes, had
gone on taxing till he raised the
devil in the <i>then</i> much enduring people.
Everything was ready for an
outbreak. The <i>Te Deum</i> after the
victory of Lens gave the signal for it.
It was a burning day in August, in
the year 1648. The city had turned
out to join in the jubilee, and, amidst
the inspiriting chorus of trumpets, and
cannons, and bells that sent exulting
chimes from many belfries, such
small matters as hunger and empty
hearths and misery in its multiform
moods and tenses were forgotten for
a moment. But it needed only a
touch to rouse the sleeping furies in
the hearts of the hungry, rejoicing
crowd. Broussel was seized by the
troops, who had just played their
part in the gay thanksgiving, and carried
off to prison&mdash;Broussel, the venerable
magistrate, the people’s sturdy
friend; who had fought their battles
over and over again against mighty
Mazarin himself; who had stood by
them and upheld their rights in the
teeth of the foreign queen and her
foreign minister; Broussel, whom the
people called <i>notre père</i>&mdash;were they
going to see him seized by soldiers, and
carried off before their eyes? No;
they would stand by him as he had
stood by them. The last notes of
the <i>Te Deum</i> were still ringing over
the city, when up leaped the shouts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
revolution and the cry “To arms!”
and chased away their holy echoes.
The mob surrounded the carriage in
which Broussel was placed, guarded
on all sides by armed men; they were
beaten back and trodden down; the
people returned to the charge undaunted,
and finally bore down on
the Palais Royal, vociferating unmannerly
threats, and demanding
Broussel: “Give us Broussel, or we
will burn down your house about
you!”&mdash;pleasant sounds for the
queen to hear beneath her windows!
Anne of Austria had not foreseen this
bursting up of the vulgar depths over
which she had hitherto ridden in safe
and scornful unconcern; nor, in all
probability, had Mazarin. He was
with the queen in that sumptuous
apartment called the queen’s boudoir,
whose one broad window, mounted
in a frame of massive silver wrought
like a brooch, looked out upon the
court; the regent paced the room in
feverish excitement, her face flushed,
her hands, alternately crossed on
her breast with an air of stern resolve,
moving in the animated and expressive
play that was familiar to her;
every now and then she would stand
in the embrasure of the rich and cunningly
carved window, and cast a
glance of mingled scorn and defiance
on the vociferous rabble below. They
catch sight of her, and greet her with
ominous signs and gestures. They
see in her cool courage a taunt that
rouses them to desperation. All unarmed
as they are, except with stones
and sticks and such like unmilitary
weapons, they are ready to give battle
to her troops. At this crisis, when
the Fronde was born, a young man
named Gondi starts to the surface,
shooting up from the dark horizon
like a glittering rocket. He is endowed
with that peculiar kind of alcoholic
eloquence which appears to be
in all climes and ages the apanage of
demagogues. Gondi had already
made himself conspicuous as a discontented
spirit whom it would be
well either to crush or to conciliate;
and Mazarin would in all likelihood
have adopted the latter plan but for
the fact of his jealousy having been
aroused by the queen’s kindly notice
of the young firebrand; he foresaw
a possible rival in Gondi’s ardor and
talents, and forthwith decreed his
ruin. Gondi was just now making
himself popular by declaiming on the
wrongs of the people, and denouncing
the seizure of Broussel as iniquitous
and tyrannical. There was some
talk of sending a despatch to the regent
to demand his release; Mazarin
caught at this opportunity of lowering
Gondi in the estimation of the
queen by placing him in the position
of a leader of the Fronde, so he sent
word to him indirectly to come to
the Palais Royal and present the
people’s petition. Gondi, who saw
in the mission an occasion for distinguishing
himself with all parties, accepted
it. He told the people that
he undertook to ask, and pledged
himself to obtain, the liberation of
Broussel within an hour. They followed
him with enthusiastic cheers
to the Palais Royal, where he was
admitted to the presence of the queen.
She received him with flattering
promptitude, unconscious of the motive
of his visit. Anne was in no
mood for compromises or concessions;
the rebellious attitude of her
subjects had steeled her heart for the
moment against the demands of clemency,
and when Gondi, announcing
himself the bearer of the demands of
the people, asked for the liberation
of the magistrate, her anger broke
out into violence: “Give up Broussel!”
she cried, with a sardonic laugh,
“I will strangle him first with my
own hands!” And clenching those
beautiful little hands that have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
sung by every poet of her day, she
went close up to Gondi, and shook
them in his face. The deputy, confounded,
stood rooted to the spot,
and uttered not a word; when Anne,
abruptly turning away, said, with a
quiet sarcasm the more chilling from
its sudden contrast with her foregoing
vehemence: “Go and rest, Monsieur
de Gondi; you have worked
hard.”</p>

<p>He left her presence, and carried
his perplexity to Mazarin. But Mazarin,
who had led him into the dilemma
of playing false to the people and
vexing the queen, coldly declined interfering,
and bowed the unsuccessful
diplomatist out. Gondi, betrayed
and baffled, left the Palais Royal with
an oath that the morrow would see
him master of Paris. When a lad of
eighteen, he had written an essay on
the <i>Conjuration de Fiesque</i>, which
drew from Richelieu the remark:
“<i>Voilà un esprit dangereux.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The day
had come when the fiery young author
was to fulfil this sagacious prophecy.
The future Cardinal de Retz
had entered the Palais Royal an ambitious
courtier: he left it an infuriated
<i>frondeur</i>. The next day Paris
was bristling with barricades&mdash;its traditional
mode of expressing its irritated
feelings.</p>

<p>This day, famous as <i>la journée des
barricades</i>, saw Mathieu Molé appear
in one of the finest attitudes that have
marked his noble and honorable career.</p>

<p>While still young, Molé had risen
to the brilliant and perilous position
of <i>Premier Président du Parlement de
Paris</i> by the mere force of talent and
rigid integrity of character; he had
never courted the patronage of a
minister, nor accepted a favor from
one; he had lent no base compliance
to Richelieu’s despotism or to Mazarin’s
more captivating rule; he had
remained the staunch friend of the
heterodox Abbé de St. Cyran, holding
faster by him in his disgrace and
imprisonment than in the days of
his transient popularity, persecuting
Richelieu to obtain his pardon, dodging
the inaccessible minister late and
early, waylaying him in all possible
and impossible places with the same
persistent cry, “Give me back my
friend St. Cyran,” till at last Richelieu,
worn out with his importunity, seized
the president by the arm one day, and
said: “This M. Molé is a worthy
magistrate, but the most obstinate
pleader in France,” and gave him
back his Abbé de St. Cyran. This was
the man who was chosen to head a
second embassy from the people to
the Palais Royal. The regent was
aware of his coming, and received
him with cold civility; but her high
spirit was slightly subdued since the
preceding day; she had passed a
sleepless night waiting for the events
of the morrow, and was disposed to
admit the possibility of coming to a
compromise with her unruly citizens.
Mathieu Molé was not an orator in
the classical sense of the word, but he
had that sort of eloquence that stirs
the hearts of men. It achieved a victory,
in the first place, over the angry
mob by making them listen to reason
and take a dispassionate view of their
position, and now it gained an equally
important one with the regent, inducing
her to yield a reluctant consent
to the liberation of Broussel.
The barricades were lowered, and
Paris gave a joyous welcome to its
friend. But the blaze thus rashly
kindled was not to be so quickly
quenched. Anne of Austria eventually
conquered both the Fronde and
the less violent but equally dangerous
pretensions of Mazarin, who, succumbing
with a fairly good grace before
the indomitable courage and inflexible
firmness of the regent, renounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the ambition of making her
his tool, and was satisfied with being
her right hand in governing the
state. How high his ambition soared
may be guessed from the following
trait. Once, when conversing with
Anne of Austria, emboldened by
that gracious <i>abandon</i> of manner
which made the haughty Spaniard so
charming in her amiable moods,
Mazarin alluded to the boyish passion
of the king for his niece, Marie
Mancini, and observed how deeply
he would have deplored it had his
majesty, yielding to the infatuation
of the hour, committed the chivalrous
folly of marrying her. Anne of Austria
drew herself up with all the pride
of her Castilian blood, and answered:
“Had my son been capable of such
an unworthiness, I should have placed
myself with his brother at the
head of the nation against him and
against you.” The proud daughter
of kings, who, by the strength of her
solitary will, could govern a nation
and cow the daring leaders of the
Fronde, was in person as tender and
delicate as a child; her health was
fragile, and her skin so sensitive that
it was difficult to find any cambric
soft enough to clothe without hurting
her. Mazarin, alluding once to this
Sybarite delicacy of temperament, declared
to the regent that her purgatory
in the next world would be to
sleep in Holland sheets. Yet, when
Anne was attacked by the cruel malady
which ended her days, no Roman
matron could have endured it with
greater fortitude. Her piety, which
had guarded her youth through the
alluring temptations of the court, despite
the neglect and rudeness of a
morose and heartless husband, sustained
her in the protracted tortures
of her last illness. Shortly before she
expired, Louis XIV. was kneeling by
the bedside of his mother, weeping
bitterly, and covering her hand with
his tears; she drew it gently away,
and, looking for a moment at that
hand which had been her chief woman’s
vanity, she murmured: “They
are beginning to swell; it is time to
go!” Some historians have flippantly
taxed Anne with having systematically
kept her son in the background,
and sacrificed him selfishly to the
prolongation of her own power; but
Louis’ passionate grief at her death,
and his lifelong gratitude to the
memory of his mother, sufficiently repudiate
this charge. Louis XIV.
never resided at the Palais Royal after
her death; when necessity obliged
him to remain in Paris, he occupied
the Louvre.</p>

<p>The characters and careers of Richelieu
and Mazarin furnish one of
those points of comparison which history
is so fond of. Richelieu was
undeniably the more brilliant statesman
of the two; he was endowed
with greater originality and a larger
breadth of view; he left a deeper impress
on his time, and his remote action
on France was more enduring;
but if the achievement of peace be
more valuable to a people than the
prosecution of war, Mazarin has paramount
claims on the gratitude of his
country. The Treaty of Westphalia,
and the Peace of the Pyrenees, are two
monuments raised by Mazarin to his
own fame that out-top all the dazzling
trophies of his predecessors, and establish
a nobler claim to the admiration
of the civilized world than
all Richelieu’s victorious accomplishments
in war. Both statesmen were
pre-eminently gifted with that power
of reading men which is so serviceable
an agent in the hands of those
who are called to govern. It was
this electric instinct which prompted
Richelieu to single out Mazarin from
the crowd as the man best fitted to
be his successor&mdash;a choice which the
young Italian justified by carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
out with unswerving fixity of purpose
the vast unfinished designs of the patron
whom death had cut short in the
midst of his work. Mazarin, on the
other hand, gave a striking proof of
this same subtle insight when he said
of the young king, then a mere boy
in his mother’s leading-strings, and
as yet having done nothing to reveal
the future grand monarch: “There
is stuff enough in him to make four
kings and one honest man.” Both
ministers set their influence and power
above the interest and authority
of the sovereign; but both labored
with unflinching steadiness of aim to
raise the monarchy to a height of
splendor it had never before reached,
and was not destined long to retain.
Both carried their <i>soutane</i> with more
of martial dignity than priestly gravity&mdash;that
<i>soutane</i> of which Richelieu
boasted: “I mow down everything,
I upset everything, and then I cover
it all with my red <i>soutane</i>.” Both
made it the business of their lives
while at the head of the state to humble
Austria and Spain, and both succeeded.
The marriage of Louis XIV.
with the Infanta of Spain was one of
Mazarin’s most successful diplomatic
acts; he foresaw in this union the
probable succession of the Bourbons
to the crown of Charles Quint. But
alongside of his many services to
his country, there is one act of his
that goes far to annul them&mdash;this
was his introduction of gambling into
France. To this deplorable importation
the Abbé St. Pierre traces,
not perhaps without a shade of exaggeration,
but with palpable logic, the
rapid decadence of the national morals
and character; he says that
Mazarin inoculated the young king
with the passion for games of hazard,
in order to keep his mind aloof from
things in which it became him better
to be interested, and thereby to prevent
his interference in the affairs of
state; the regent, in her turn, became
smitten with the novel mania, and
would spend whole nights with her
court playing cards. Mazarin himself
was an incorrigible gambler, and
often devoted to this passion the
hours he should have given to sleep
after his day’s arduous task. He
was looked upon more as a player of
doubtful honesty&mdash;“<i>un joueur plus que
suspect</i>”; but “who allowed others
in turn to cheat him, provided they
did it cleverly,” St. Pierre tells us;
and he goes on to say: “The young
nobles, first at court, and then all over
the country, followed his example,
and took to card-playing; they forsook
the athletic sports and manly
amusements which had delighted
their fathers, and gave themselves up
to this enervating and ruinous passion;
they became weaker, more ignorant,
and less polished; women
caught the fever, and grew to respect
themselves less, and to be less respected.”
Mazarin’s avarice was as
insatiable as his ambition; he died
colossally rich; but during his last
illness, seized with remorse, he made
over all his unjust gains to the king,
who, of course, refused to accept
them, and the cardinal then divided
his vast wealth between Louis, the
queen, Condé, Turenne, his friend
Louis de Haro, and several members
of his own family. He bequeathed
a large sum for the foundation of a
college, which he also endowed with
his splendid library, recollected after
its dispersion by the Frondeurs at immense
trouble and expense. He
wished this college to be called <i>Collége
des quatre nations</i>, destining it
chiefly for the education of young
men belonging to the four provinces
annexed to France during his ministry&mdash;Pignerol,
Alsace, Roussillon, and
Artois. Le Tellier, who was his executor,
punctually obeyed all his instructions
except the last-named. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
desire of the king, it was called Collége
Mazarin, which was to become
the magnificent Bibliothèque Royale
of to-day.</p>

<p>Henrietta Maria of England occupied
the Palais Royal in 1644. The
marriage of her daughter Henrietta
to Philip of Orleans, then Duc d’Anjou,
was celebrated here with great
pomp, and here the young princess
held a brilliant court for a few years,
while her mother dwelt in the cloistered
retreat of Chaillot. The thread
of this bright young life was suddenly
snapped asunder. Bossuet’s “O
night of horror!” came like a thunderbolt
from a summer sky, scattering
the volatile court, and spreading the
news of its loss over the whole of
France. Then came the Regency,
which was to add a chapter of such
dark and lamentable notoriety to the
history of the Palais Royal. The
nephew of Louis XIV. inherited all
the vices and foibles of his race without
any of their redeeming qualities.
His selfish, easy-going <i>bonhomie</i> has
been sometimes lauded as clemency;
but it may more justly be considered
a combination of weakness and cynical
contempt for the claims of justice.
When the enraged populace gathered
before his palace, dragging three
naked corpses&mdash;the victims of their
legitimate but misplaced anger&mdash;along
with them, the regent looked
out at the tempestuous scene, and
remarked coolly: “The mob are
right; the wonder is they bear so
much from us.” And truly it was a
wonder; and if the Revolution of ‘93
did not break out under the lawless
and exasperating rule of the Regency,
it must only have been because, as
St. Simon explained it, “three things
are necessary to make a revolution:
leaders, brains, and funds, none of
which were to be found in France at
this period.” The <i>petits soupers de la
Régence</i>, which have acquired an infamous
celebrity through all the chronicles
of the time, can have no place
in our sketch.</p>

<p>The visit of Peter the Great broke
in on the luxurious and effeminate
court of the Palais Royal like a Spartan
appearing suddenly in the midst
of a banquet of Sybarites. Peter,
who had “civilized his people by
cutting their heads off,” set his heart
on visiting France during the preceding
reign; but Louis XIV., partly
from an insurmountable antipathy to
the semi-barbarous autocrat, partly
from political motives, had signified
to his brother of all the Russias that
his absence would be more agreeable
than his presence. Peter was compelled,
therefore, to wait until the
Grand Monarque had rejoined his ancestors
before gratifying his desire to
visit Paris. The regent, far from
making any difficulty about receiving
him, made the most sumptuous preparations
for the Northern reformer,
and invited him to be his guest at
the Palais Royal. But the hardy
Muscovite could not conceal his contempt
for the epicurean habits of his
host, and horrified him by declaring
that he never slept on anything softer
than a camp-stretcher, which he carried
with him in all his peregrinations,
and used on the field of battle and
in his own palace, and which he insisted
now on substituting for the
luxurious couch prepared for him.
Altogether, the ways of Peter bewildered
the nephew of Louis XIV.
He was up with the birds, and flying
over the city to see things and people
that the latter would never have
dreamed of calling his attention to.
He expressed a wish to see Mme. de
Maintenon, then living in dignified
retreat at St. Cyr. Her Solidity, as
Louis XIV. had dubbed her, pleaded
ill-health as an excuse for declining
the honor and fatigue of an official
reception. Peter, therefore, set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
off one morning and scared the learned
and sedate ladies of St. Cyr out
of their propriety by requesting to
be shown at once to Mme. de Maintenon’s
room. On arriving there, he
entered without knocking, walked
straight to the bed, pushed aside the
curtains, and, sitting down beside the
astonished lady, entered brusquely
into conversation. The Sorbonne he
also honored with one of these unceremonious
visitations; perceiving
a statue of Richelieu in one of the
galleries, he rushed up to it, and,
clasping the marble in his arms, exclaimed:
“O incomparable man!
would that thou wert still alive, and
I would give thee one-half of my
empire to teach me how to govern
the other!”</p>

<p>But with all this rough and somewhat
ostentatious disregard of etiquette,
Peter had a keen sense of
what was due to his imperial mightiness,
and, with the caprice of a
despot, could assert it trenchantly
enough when he thought fit. The
regent invited a number of the most
illustrious men of the day to meet
his eccentric guest at a banquet at
the Palais Royal. As they were
about to enter the dining-room, little
Louis XV. stood back to let the
czar pass first; Peter was unwilling
to take precedence of the King of
France, and equally reluctant to walk
behind a child, so he wittily solved
the difficulty by catching up the
small monarch in his arms and carrying
him to his seat.</p>

<p>The regent closed his ignoble life
at the Palais Royal in 1723. His
son Louis, Duke of Orleans, succeeded
him. This prince brought
his young bride, Jeanne de Bade,
there soon after he took possession
of his ancestral home, and lost her
after a brief and blissful union. At
the time of her death, Louis XV. was
lying mortally sick, it was believed,
at Metz, and thither, in the frenzy of
his grief, the bereaved husband flew,
and, going straight to the room of the
dying king, demanded admittance;
the attendants expostulated, but Louis
pushed them aside, and kicked in the
door to announce his loss to the kinsman
who himself lay battling with
death. He survived Jeanne some
years, but never recovered her loss;
he led a solitary and desolate life,
and gave himself up to works of
benevolence and the study of oriental
languages. He became a perfect
adept in the Arabic, Hebrew, and
Greek tongues, and never appeared
at court as a widower except when
the imperious etiquette of Versailles
occasionally demanded it. He died
in 1752. His son’s reign at the
Palais Royal is chiefly remarkable by
his having inoculated his own children
with small-pox; the daring experiment,
which was performed by
Tronchin, summoned from Geneva
for the purpose, was crowned with
success. Paris, transported with joy,
made bonfires in the Place in front of
the palace, and for a time the rash
and fortunate father was the hero of
toast and song. Another event
which signalized his occupation of
Richelieu’s palace was the destruction
of the theatre by fire (1763).
The duke rebuilt it on a somewhat
larger but infinitely less gorgeous
scale as to decoration. He was an
enlightened patron of art, and especially
kind in assisting young men
whose talent was struggling to make
head against poverty. He divined
the genius of the young poet Le
Fèvre, and encouraged him both by
personal notice and by liberal gifts.
He was so pleased with Le Fèvre’s
tragedy <i>Zuma</i> that immediately on
its appearance he bestowed a pension
of 1,200 crowns on the poet
out of his privy purse; and on the
latter’s asking what services were expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
from him in return for this
munificence, the duke answered: “It
obliges you to work henceforth more
ardently for your own fame&mdash;nothing
more.” This prince, though he allowed
himself to be drawn, to a certain
extent, into the fashionable follies
of the court, had inherited from his
father many sterling and beautiful
qualities. His benevolence was unbounded;
but it was only after his
death that his real character was revealed,
so carefully did he shun
everything like ostentation in the
exercise of his favorite virtue. It
was then discovered that two-thirds
of his immense revenue had been
spent upon the poor, in the payment
of pensions to artists, men of letters,
widows, etc.; some granted in his
own name, others in the name of one
or other of his ancestors. His condescending
kindness towards his dependents
endeared him to all who
approached him. A chamberlain
coming one day to announce to him
the death of a most inefficient and
tiresome valet, who had been twenty
years in the duke’s service, “Poor
fellow!” sighed the duke, “for twenty
years he served me, and for twenty
years he worried me!” “Why did
you keep him, monseigneur?” inquired
a bystander. “Why, he would never
have found a place if I had turned
him away,” replied the prince, and
then added: “We must see now that
his wife and children are provided
for.” Was it not Sophocles who
said, “Only a great soul knows how
much glory there is in being kind”?
What a germ of true glory there lies
buried in this quiet little trait of
Louis d’Orléans!</p>

<p>The death of this magnificent
patron, forbearing master, and generous
father of the poor makes way for
another prince of the House of Orleans
who has earned a louder but
less enviable notoriety on the world-stage
of history. Almost immediately
on his becoming master of the Palais
Royal, the new Duc d’Orléans had
the vexation of seeing the theatre so
recently rebuilt by his father burnt
down again. Discouraged, no doubt,
by this precedent, he refused to rebuild
it at his own expense, and applied
to the city of Paris for the
necessary funds; but that body declined
to furnish them. The <i>Comédie
Française</i> was consequently transferred
to the Porte St. Martin, where
a building was erected in the space
of six weeks by Lenoir. It was not
till many years later that Richelieu’s
beautiful temple to dramatic art was
rebuilt by a prince of the House of
Orleans, to be henceforth hired out
on lease to enterprising managers.</p>

<p>We are told that in his early youth
Joseph Philippe d’Orléans gave promise
of an estimable manhood. How
wofully this promise was belied by
his after-life and shameful and tragic
death we know. He was born at St.
Cloud in 1747, and married, in 1769,
the only daughter of the Duc de
Penthièvre&mdash;a creature endowed with
every charm of person and mind to
make her at once reverenced and
loved. Philippe was tall, slight, and
well proportioned, his features finely
cut and lit up with vivacity and intelligence,
his manners gracious and
dignified. Such is the portrait handed
down to us of him in those early
days before the shadow of coming
infamy had obscured the picture. He
fell soon into habits of unbridled
dissipation; but, so long as he confined
himself to this, to mad charioteering
pranks on the boulevards,
and aerial escapades in balloons, with
boon companions as mad as himself,
the people looked on in contemptuous
disapproval. It was necessary, in
order to stimulate this passive feeling
to one of direct antagonism, that he
should interfere with the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
pleasure and convenience. This he
did by turning his broad and richly
planted garden into a huge shop, thus
depriving the <i>bourgeois</i> and idlers of
Paris of their accustomed resort on
the sultry days and long mellow evenings
of summer. His royal highness
had contrived very soon to compromise
a fortune more than royal in its
extent; and, in order to replenish his
coffers, he decided to cut down his
ancestral chestnuts, and build up in
their place long rows of shops, to be
hired out at a high rent to tradespeople.
The fashionables and the
<i>bourgeois</i>, and, more important than
all in a Frenchman’s eyes, the children,
were thus driven to promenade
under a stone colonnade, instead of
enjoying the green shade of Richelieu’s
groves, where the buzz of a multifarious
bazaar had replaced the
cooing of doves and the twitter of
singing-birds. By-and-by we see the
thermometer rising from resentful dislike
to fierce hatred. Philip is smitten
with Anglomania, and spends his
time and, what is of more consequence
to Paris, his money in London. He
wears only London-made coats, drives
English horses, hires English grooms,
altogether affects the ways and manners
of <i>outre-mer</i>, to the great disgust
of Versailles and the boulevards.
Wretched Philip! well had it been for
him and for Versailles had he dwelt
content in these puerile masquerades
and self-degrading follies! But under
the frivolous surface there lay a substratum
of cruel vindictiveness, a
bristling self-love, that was quick to
see an affront, and implacable in
avenging it. Marie Antoinette had
the dire ill-luck to offend her disreputable
cousin of Orleans. When
her brother, the Archduke Maximilian,
came to see her at Versailles,
the queen, then in her twentieth year,
very naturally desired to see as much
as possible of this dear companion of
her childhood during his short stay;
so she dispensed, as far as she could,
with court ceremonial, remaining
chiefly in her private apartments with
her brother. It did not probably
occur to her that, in omitting to invite
the Duc d’Orléans to share this
sisterly intercourse, she was inflicting
a wound that would one day distil
its deadly poison upon herself and
those dearest to her. So it was, however.
Philip never forgave what he
considered a slight, and bitterly did
he make the thoughtless young queen
repent having inflicted it.</p>

<p>The gardens of the Palais Royal,
which had given rise to his first unpopularity,
were destined to be the
scene of the upheaving of the revolution.
All was ready, only waiting
for a bold hand to give a push to the
pendulum and set it going. Camille
Desmoulins did it. It was the
12th of July, 1789. Yesterday the
great crisis had been prepared, and
to-day it burst. Necker, the universal
genius whose advent to the ministry
was hailed as the panacea for all
discords, and difficulties, and threatened
dangers; Necker, the “Achilles
of computation,” whose, vigorous
hand and capacious brain were to
seize France, tottering on the brink
of some invisible gulf, and steady
her; Necker, to whom the timid,
apathetic king, and the proud, valiant
queen, had all but gone on their
knees to induce him to come and redeem
the treasury by “swift arithmetic,”
and save the government
and&mdash;yes, even at this date they
must have included it in the salvations
to be accomplished by Necker&mdash;the
throne; Necker, who had yielded
to the royal suppliants with these
words: “I yield in obedience to
duty, but with the certainty that I
am doomed”&mdash;Necker had been dismissed.
On the 11th of July, Louis
XVI. signed the letter imploring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
minister to leave the kingdom “at
once and without <i>éclat</i>.” When his
secretary objected that Necker’s extraordinary
popularity was a strong
presumption against his obeying this
last command; that he had only to
show himself, and the people would
rise <i>en masse</i> to prevent his flight,
Louis replied: “I know Necker;
he will guard us against himself; he
will obey me scrupulously, and fly
without <i>éclat</i>.” And he was right.
The minister received the letter at
three in the afternoon, and quietly
put it in his pocket without communicating
its contents even to his wife;
he dined at the usual hour with some
friends already invited; nothing in his
appearance or conversation betrayed
the slightest emotion during the repast;
on leaving the table, he showed
the letter of dismissal to Mme.
Necker, ordered his carriage, and they
went out for a drive; when they
were about two hundred yards from
the house, he pulled the check-string,
and desired the coachman to drive
to the nearest post-station. It was
not till the following morning that
his daughter and his numerous
friends knew of his departure. The
news electrified everybody. Camille
Desmoulins’ grand opportunity had
arrived. He had already made himself
notorious as a leader of malcontents;
this afternoon he was drinking
with a certain set of them in a <i>café</i>
at the Palais Royal&mdash;of late a favorite
rendezvous of patriots of his type&mdash;noisy
and blustering, believing in
copious libations as the most efficacious
proof of patriotism. Desmoulins,
on hearing the news, rushed out,
pistol in hand, and, jumping on an
orange-tree tub, proceeded to harangue
the assembled multitude. He
was afflicted with a painful stuttering
in his speech, but this impediment
appears to have been no hindrance
to the effect of his oratory;
on the contrary, it gave it a more
vehement character, impelling him to
wild and passionate gesticulation, by
way of helping out his defective
utterance. He spoke with his eyes,
his teeth, every member of his body;
he would shake out his hair in lion-like
fashion, stamp his feet, toss his
arms with clenched fists above his
head to supply the word his tongue
refused to articulate, and the energetic
pantomine elicited the sympathy,
while it fired the passions, of his
hearers. “Citizens!” he cried, “I
come from Versailles.” (He came
from a neighboring <i>café</i>, as we have
seen, but what of that?) “Necker
is dismissed. This dismissal is the
tocsin of S. Bartholomew for all
patriots. Before the sun has gone
down, we shall see the Swiss and
German battalions marching from
the Champs de Mars to murder us
like dogs. One chance yet remains
to us. To arms! Let us choose a
cockade whereby we may know each
other.” This exordium was covered
with thundering salvos by the patriots.
“What color shall we choose?”
continued the orator. “Speak, patriots!
Select your own flag. Shall
it be green, the emblem of hope, or
blue&mdash;the color of free America, of
liberty, and democracy?” A voice
from the patriots cried out: “Green,
the color of hope!” But the choice
was negatived by the voice of popular
prejudice. Green, it was said,
was unlucky. No; they would not
have green.</p>

<p>A scene of indescribable tumult
followed while the momentous question
of the cockade was being canvassed.
Finally, by what train of
argument history does not record,
blue, white, and red were elected to
the honor of representing the patriots.
They happened to be the colors of
the House of Orleans. From the
tub which served as a rostrum to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
orator the decree was shouted to the
serried ranks around, and all through
the gardens it was borne along the
colonnade rapid as lightning, swelling,
as it went, into a deafening peal that
soon reverberated from the boulevards
and the thoroughfares of Paris
to Versailles. It is said, we know
not whether or not on authentic testimony,
that while this wild uproar,
which terminated in the adoption of
his House’s colors by the popular
party, was going on under his windows,
Philip of Orleans, henceforth
to be known under the title of Egalité,
was coolly looking out at the
performance, smoking his cigar, and
discussing the probable effect of it
all at Versailles. By the time the
whole city was out-of-doors, it was
the hour for the performance to begin
in the Palais Royal theatre, close
by the scene of Camille’s rhetorical
triumph; other more interesting
pieces, beginning with comedy and
ending with tragedy, were now to be
performed; a band of patriots, with
Camille at their head, burst into the
theatre, and, rushing on the stage,
summarily reversed the programme
of the evening. They flung tricolor
cockades right and left, and called
the spectators to arms. “The audience
rose <i>en masse</i>” at the appeal,
like a true-born Parisian audience,
and, surging from pit and boxes, poured
out impetuous and desperate, it
knew not well why, at the bidding
of Camille Desmoulins. He marched
off, with the swelling stream behind
him, to the studio of the sculptor
Curtius; there the patriots seized
a bust of Necker and Philip of Orleans,
and carried them in procession
through the streets. This was Egalité’s
official <i>début</i>, as a leader of the
Red Revolution. It was at the Palais
Royal he was arrested. Here, on
the site of its first eruption, the wild
demon which he had, in the measure
of his power, evoked and called up
from the smouldering lava depths to
the full activity of its satanic life, and
flattered and bowed down to, was
doomed at the appointed hour of
retribution to raise its bloody hand
against the regicide, and strike him
down. On his way to the guillotine,
the car, whether by accident or design,
passed under Egalité’s old
home. He raised his eyes for a moment
to the windows, and, surveying
them with an unmoved countenance,
turned his glance calmly again upon
the yelling crowd.</p>

<p>While the Terror lasted, the Palais
Royal remained untenanted. After
the Restoration it was occupied by
Louis Philippe while Duke of Orleans;
when the son of Egalité called
himself to the throne of his nephew,
he forsook it for the Tuileries, and during
the remainder of his reign it was
open to the public as an historical
monument and museum. On the
resurrection of the Empire, the Palais
Royal became the residence of Prince
Jerome Bonaparte, only surviving
brother of Napoleon I. When this
last venerable twig fell from the
old imperial tree, it continued in the
possession of his son, Prince Napoleon.
Hither, in March, 1859, he
brought his young bride, the Princess
Clothilde, daughter of Victor Emmanuel,
and there he resided until the
memorable summer of 1870, when the
disastrous war with Prussia came like
a cyclone, and tore up the old tree by
the roots, and sent the branches
flying hither and thither over the
astonished face of Europe.</p>

<p>The Commune closes our retrospect
of Richelieu’s palace. The
Tuileries and the Palais Royal sent
up their petroleum flames together
to the soft summer skies where the
bright May sun was shining down,
serenely sad, upon the awful spectacle
of Paris on fire&mdash;a funeral pile whereon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
were consumed, let us hope never
again to rise from their ashes, the
Commune itself, and the delusions of
the few honest fools, if such there
were, who believed in its insane theories.
Surely as they fled, scared from
their old historic haunts by the blaze
and stench of the devilish modern
fluid, the ghosts of Richelieu, and Mazarin,
and Anne of Austria, and all
that band of majestic figures from the
unburied past, must have laughed a
bitter laugh, wherein horror was not
without a note of triumph, as they
looked back upon the ghastly scene.
“Our little systems had their day,”
the dead legislators may have said,
one to another, as they stood in the
lurid light of the conflagration that
illuminated, to the eyes of their disembodied
spirit, the far-stretching
vistas of the present and the past;
“they were all faulty, how faulty we
know now with unavailing knowledge,
but, compared to this, were they
not the Millennium, Eutopia, the
ideal of the reign of justice upon the
earth?”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c130" id="c130">AN ABUSE OF DIPLOMATIC AUTHORITY.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> tendency, to which we have
heretofore alluded, to ostracize Catholics,
and to take it for granted that
this is a Protestant country, to be
ruled exclusively by anti-Catholics,
has had even a more dangerous and
far-reaching effect beyond our borders,
and that, too, apparently with
official sanction. The popular prejudice
has not unnaturally reached and
infected the authorities at Washington.
We do not allude especially to the
present Administration or Congress,
for the evil is of long standing; but
we have no hesitation in saying that
our diplomatic and consular systems as
at present conducted are unjust to a
very respectable minority of the American
people, and are likely to mislead
and deceive the nations with which
we are on terms of peace and amity.
The foreign appointees are, almost
without exception, taken from the
ranks of non-Catholics and without
regard either to the feelings of a
large class of our own citizens or the
wishes of the people to whom they
are sent. The ministers plenipotentiary
to the great powers of Europe
have been invariably selected from
the ultra Protestant class like Motley;
while the numerous consuls,
with a few honorable exceptions,
have been men of the same way of
thinking, according to their limited
understanding. When the Holy Father
was yet in possession of his dominions,
we used to delight in sending
him now and then a specimen of a genuine
Know-Nothing; and when Spain&mdash;Catholic
and conservative Spain&mdash;began
to feel the Gem of the Antilles
slipping from her grasp, we despatched
an atheistical <i>filibustero</i>, Soulé, to
assure her of our friendship and good-will
With Catholic countries generally
we have acted in the same spirit
of contradiction, as if our object were
to excite hostility rather than to perpetuate
kindness and harmony, as
among them, particularly in South
America, each legation and consulate
habitually formed the nucleus of anti-Catholic
society. As long as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
blundering&mdash;we will not call it by a
harsher name&mdash;was confined to our
European appointments, it mattered
little; for the relative condition of
Catholics and the sects in this country
is there pretty well known, and, the
faith of the people being well fixed,
prejudice and bigotry, even when protected
by the stars and stripes, could
do little harm.</p>

<p>It is of the character of our representatives
in Turkey, Africa, India,
China, and other places <i>in partibus
infidelium</i> that we have most reason
to complain. These American
envoys and consuls seem to become
volunteer lay evangelizers; and if, like
our friends of the Methodist and
Presbyterian missionary societies of
this city, they do not succeed in converting
the benighted heathen from
the error of their ways, they endeavor,
by the exercise of all their delegated
authority, to thwart and depreciate
the labors of those who can&mdash;the
Catholic missionaries from other
countries. Take, for example, India
and China, the great missionary
fields of the world, containing as they
do at least one-half of the whole human
race in a comparative state of
civilization. The former being a
province of Great Britain, it is natural
that sectarian missions should
receive at least a semi-official recognition
and protection from the appointees
of the head of the Protestant
Church “as by law established”;
but even in this respect the English
officials have been outdone in zeal
and officiousness by our own agents
in the Indian Peninsula, as we learn
from a late work on that country.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
But in China, with its four or five
hundred millions of idolaters, the case
is different. There the Catholic
priest and the devoted Sister of Charity,
unsupported by the temporal arm,
and unawed by threats, torture, and
death, have been most active and
most successful in advancing the
standard of the cross and winning souls
to Christ. Their converts are numbered
by tens of thousands, and their
churches, schools, and orphanages
dot the southern and western coasts;
while the sectarian missionaries, lacking
the sustaining power of the state,
have practically done nothing. This
has long been a source of much chagrin
to the various dissenting proselytizing
societies in England and the
United States, as it also seems to
have been the cause of exasperation
to our Minister at Peking, Mr. Frederick
F. Low.</p>

<p>That gentleman’s mission to China
appears to have embraced but three
objects, if we except his attempt and
absurd failure to bring the Coreans
into communication with the outside
world. The first of these was the
protection of American Protestant
missionaries, and them only; the
second, to convince the Chinese officials
that the United States have
nothing to do with Catholics, or,
as he is pleased to style them on
all occasions, “Romanists”; and the
third, to send home false despatches
and mistranslated documents.</p>

<p>In looking over the foreign correspondence
of our government for
1871, as presented to Congress with
the President’s Message,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> we find
that, in October, 1870, Mr. Low,
without any authority whatever from
Washington, ordered a United States
war-vessel from Chefoo to Tungchow,
for the sole purpose of returning
some Protestant missionaries to
the latter place, who, with their usual
regard for the first law of nature,
had fled from it upon the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
rumor of danger. The ship was the
<i>Benecia</i>, and her precious cargo consisted
of “the missionaries (number
not stated), their teachers and servants,
also <i>their children</i>, amounting
to a total of twenty-four persons.”
Of the reverend gentlemen at whose
disposal a public vessel had been so
obsequiously placed by the accommodating
Mr. Low, Commander
Kimberly, in his report, bluntly says:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The missionaries expressed themselves
perfectly satisfied with everything that
had been done in regard to returning
them to their homes, and wished me to
visit the shore and walk about the city
with the officers of the ship in full uniform,
which I declined to do, as, after the
promises made by the Chinese officials, I
considered it unnecessary, and the Chinese
being perfectly willing and pleased,
as far as I could judge, that they had returned.
From my interview, I came to
the conclusion that there never existed
any real danger at Tungchow-foo, but
the missionaries were frightened by the
threats of some Chinese not in authority.
Mischievous persons are found in every
community, and Tungchow-foo is not
free from this infliction. The massacre
of Tientsin capped the climax, and the
missionaries left in consequence.”</p>

<p class="p1">The cowardly conduct of the missionaries,
who were thus so honorably
reconducted to their homes, is even
partially admitted by the minister in
his explanatory despatch, for he says:
“In this connection, I desire to say
that I have had no information from
the missionaries, except a short note
from one of them saying that they
had all reached Tungchow. Without
expressing any opinion as to the
real peril they were in, or whether
there was or was not cause for the
step they took, I am of the opinion
that their removal and the manner
of their return will, on the whole, result
in good.”</p>

<p>We admit that it is the duty of
every envoy, consul, or other foreign
agent of our government to succor
and protect our citizens abroad in all
things lawful; but here, in this respect,
their duty ends. They have
no shadow of right to employ the
public vessels of the country, paid for
by the public at large, and destined
for far other purposes, in any other
business, much less for the transportation
of runaway missionaries, “their
teachers, servants, and children.”
This is not a Protestant country <i>de
facto</i> or <i>de jure</i>, and, as far as the national
government is concerned, no
religion whatever is recognized. If
it were an equal number of merchants
or traders who had fled in terror from
imaginary danger, is it likely that Mr.
Low would have depleted our small
squadron in the Chinese seas by putting
at their service, and that of their
“teachers, servants, and children,”
one of the best vessels in the fleet?
Or does any one suppose that, if those
persons had been Catholic missionaries,
he would have been guilty of a
similar abuse of authority? But he
apologetically says, “The manner of
their return will, on the whole, result
in good.” Just so. Good to Mr.
Low, though we have not yet heard
of a vote of thanks having been presented
to him by any of our numerous
foreign missionary societies, or that
they have sent on to Washington
deputations for his retention or promotion.
That his conduct deserves
such commendation from these bodies
no one can doubt who reads further
his despatches to the State Department.</p>

<p>In 1858, a treaty was formed between
China, on the one part, and the
leading Western powers, on the other,
whereby, among other things, it was
stipulated that the Christian converts
in the former country should practise
their religion without molestation, and
also enjoy certain immunities; and
that in the free or open ports and
districts the ministers of religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
should be guaranteed the full exercise
of their functions, etc. In 1870,
as previously agreed upon, this treaty
came up for revision, and France,
ever foremost in the work of civilization
and conversion, proposed five
amendments to the treaty, all relating
directly or indirectly to commerce.
The second of these reads as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“You have expressed a desire to know
the demands which I have engaged my
government to make from the Chinese
government when the treaty of 1858 is revised.
I have no objection to satisfy
you, for I believe that the alterations
are indispensable, and I shall be happy
to learn that the other governments allied
with China have decided also to demand
them.... Second, I demand that we
shall have the right to place salaried consuls
wherever we judge proper, and that
those cities where consuls reside shall
also be opened to foreign trade.”</p>

<p class="p1">These demands seemed rational
enough, and have since, we understand,
been substantially complied
with; but our clear-sighted minister
immediately detected the danger that
lurked beneath them, particularly the
one just quoted, and hastened to advise
his government not to second
the propositions of the French ambassador.
Here is one of his reasons:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I see so many objections to such a
treaty provision, and so many chances of
its proving a delusion and a snare, that,
unless the proposition can be more definitely
defined, I should not be inclined
to favor it. If the exact truth could be
ascertained, it would be found, I expect,
that the whole idea of the French <i>chargé</i>
in this scheme is the better protection of
the French missionaries; and were it
possible to obtain the concession asked
for, these additional consuls would be, to
all intents and purposes, agents of Roman
Catholic missionaries. Their official
positions and influence would be used to
sustain missionary claims and assumptions,
some of which have been described
in a former despatch. So far as trade is
concerned, it may well be questioned
whether the presence of French consuls
in the interior would not prove a damage
instead of a benefit.”</p>

<p class="p1">And this is the representative of a
free and commercial people who desire
to be considered Christian! Rather
than see Catholic missions extended,
and paganism eradicated
from the hearts of millions of human
beings, he would be willing to keep
some of the most populous and fertile
portions of the Celestial Empire
closed for ever against civilization and
commerce. But let us follow this
model minister a little further.</p>

<p>In February, 1871, the Chinese
Foreign Office submitted to the foreign
representatives at the capital,
for consideration and approval, the
draft of a minute, and eight rules for
the guidance and government of
missionaries in the entire empire.
They were drawn up with true Tartar
cunning and ingenuity, and were intended,
if adopted, to baffle the
straightforward demands of France.
In terms they were plausible enough,
but in reality exceedingly restrictive,
and evidently aimed at the Sisters of
Charity, whose schools and orphan
asylums were rapidly increasing, and
at those zealous and enterprising
missionaries who, under various disguises,
and despite the vigilance of
the local authorities, are in the habit,
at imminent personal danger, of
penetrating into the very heart of the
country, and preaching the Word of
God where his name has never before
been heard. This was a chance
for Mr. Low to exhibit his sectarian
bigotry before the mandarins, and
he eagerly availed himself of it.
Answering their communication in
his official capacity, and while dissenting
generally from their views, he
takes occasion, we think very gratuitously,
to say:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is a noticeable fact that, among all
the cases cited, there does not appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
be one in which Protestant missionaries
are charged with violating treaty, law, or
custom. So far as I can ascertain, your
complaints are chiefly against the action
and attitude of the missionaries of the
Roman Catholic faith, and, as these are
under the exclusive protection and control
of the government of France, I might
with great propriety decline to discuss <i>a
matter with which the government of the
United States has no direct interest or concern</i>,
for the reason that none of its citizens
are charged with violating treaty or
local law, and thus causing trouble.”</p>

<p class="p1">And again, with equal truthfulness
and appositeness, he adds:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Whenever cases occur in which the
missionaries overstep the bounds of decorum,
or interfere in matters with which
they have no proper concern, let each
case be reported promptly to the minister
of the country to which it belongs. Such
isolated instances should not produce
prejudice or engender hatred against
those who observe their obligations, nor
should sweeping complaints be made
against all on this account. Those from
the United States sincerely desire the reformation
of those whom they teach, and
to do this they urge the examination of
the Holy Scriptures, wherein the great
doctrines of the present and a future
state, and also the resurrection of the soul,
are set forth, with the obligation of repentance,
belief in the Saviour, and the duties
of man to himself and others. It is
owing, in a great degree, to the prevalence
of a belief in the truth of the Scriptures
that Western nations have attained
their power and prosperity.”</p>

<p class="p1">Having thus, as he thought, directed
the prejudice and hostility of the
authorities against the Catholics exclusively,
and put in a good word for
the evangelizers; and assured them
that, as far as the former were concerned,
the United States had no
concern whatever, and by inference
that they might maltreat and murder
as many of them as they pleased
without let or hindrance from us,
Mr. Low next proceeds to mislead
his government in a manner which
may be diplomatic, but is certainly
far from honorable.</p>

<p>In transmitting to the Department
of State a translation of the rules
alluded to, he remarks:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“A careful reading of the memorandum
clearly proves that the great, if not
only, cause of complaint against the missionaries
comes from the action of the
Roman Catholic priests and the native
Christians of that faith; although the
rules proposed for the government of
missionaries apply equally to Protestants
and Catholics.”</p>

<p class="p1">“A careful reading” of the document
as translated under his auspices
would indeed seem to bear out
Mr. Low’s views, for it is filled with
complaints and denunciations of
“Romanists,” and the derivative adjective
“Romish” is used with a freedom
that would delight the heart of
the most virulent <i>colporteur</i>. But, unfortunately,
there was another translation
of the same document in England,
and in it, behold, all the “Romanists”
are turned into “Christians”!<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Even Mr. Davis, of the
State Department, could not help
noticing this discrepancy between the
two papers, and in a letter dated
Oct. 19, 1871, calls upon the Peking
minister for an explanation, which,
of course, was never given, for the
good reason that the deception was
intentional. If, as according to
Blackstone, forgery consists in the
material alteration of the body of a
written instrument, as well as in the
imitation or alteration of a signature,
we fear our respected representative
has been guilty of a very serious
legal mistake. The assistant secretary
writes:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Two versions of these regulations
have found their way to the Department&mdash;the
translation enclosed in your No. 56,
and a translation apparently made from
a French version presented to the
houses of Parliament in Great Britain
in June or July last, and printed in <i>British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Blue-Book</i>, entitled “China, No. 3,
1871.” These versions differ widely in
form and expression, and, to some extent,
in sense.</p>

<p>“The version presented to Parliament
has been or will be made the subject of
instructions by her Majesty’s government
to Mr. Wade. A copy of these proposed
instructions was communicated to this
Department by her Majesty’s <i>chargé</i> at
Washington in August last. A copy is
herewith enclosed, and also a copy of the
version to which they relate.</p>

<p>“The most material variance between
the two versions is in the designation of
the missionaries against whom the Chinese
Foreign Office complains. Your
version limits the complaints to missionaries
of the Roman Church. The British
translation, following the French version,
represents the complaints against ‘Christians.’
For instance, the British version
renders the beginning of the first article
or rule as follows: ‘The Christians, when
they found an orphanage, give no notice
to the authorities, and appear to act with
mystery.’ Your translation of the same
sentence reads: “The establishment of
asylums for training up children by the
Romanists has hitherto not been reported
to the authorities, and as these institutions
are carefully kept private,’ etc., etc.
From the English version of the accompanying
note from the Yamên, it is evident
that the Chinese Foreign Office recognizes
that there are in China Christian missionaries
of different faiths; for they say that
‘the people in general, unaware of the
difference which exists between Protestantism
and Catholicism, confound these two
religions under this latter denomination.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The sectarian views of the minister
in Peking were ably seconded by
his subordinate, the consul-general
at Shanghai. That official, Mr. G.
F. Seward, under date August 22,
1871, sends to the Assistant-Secretary
of State a cursory review of the general
condition of China, and a detailed
account of the horrible massacre
of Tientsin, June 21, 1870;
with a report of the trial and execution
of some of the miscreants engaged
in it. His communication, as
might be expected, is, whenever
possible, thoroughly anti-Catholic,
filled with innuendos, insinuations,
and even broad statements against
the missionaries of that faith, and the
Sisters of Charity; the usual elegant
phrases “Romish” and “Romanist”
being used at every opportunity. As
a sample of this <i>commercial</i> agent’s
style and skill in the art of hinting a
fault and hesitating dislike, we quote
the following passages from his letter:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Various allegations have been made
against Roman Catholic missionaries. It
has been alleged that the bishop of one
of the western provinces resides in a
palace which vies with that of the viceroy;
that he uses a palanquin decorated in a
way allowed only to the highest officials
of the empire; and that his progresses
from one part of his diocese to another
are made in a regal way. It has been
asserted that the priests claim the right
to correspond with the officials on terms
of equality; that they combine with and
arrange combinations among their converts
to defeat the objects of the government;
that they claim for their converts
various unusual and objectionable immunities;
that, in fact, they are building
up a rule within the territorial rule which
is very dangerous to the state. One who
has studied the history of the Roman
Church cannot be surprised when he
hears that China is seriously alarmed;
but we can estimate the actual danger
more perfectly than she. Any exposition
of her fears which she is likely to make
will exhibit many puerilities. Yet we
must admit that her statesmen would be
unwise if they should fail to study the
problems which the presence of the
church presents.”</p>

<p class="p1">So much for some of our diplomats
in Asia. If they had been sent out
by the Methodist missionary body
or any other fanatical society, they
could not have shown more narrow-minded
bigotry or less regard for the
advancement of religion and true
civilization; but as representatives
of this republic, where all are regarded
as equal, and where the
general government is supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
represent the interests of every class
and creed alike, it is not too much
to say that they have been sadly recreant
to the trust reposed in them.</p>

<p>Turning over the pages of this voluminous
collection of foreign correspondence
from all parts of the world
with the Department of State, we came
upon the following curious despatch.
It is dated Mexico, April 29, 1871,
signed by our minister, Mr. Thomas
H. Nelson, and referred to in the index
as “The Spread of Protestantism”:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The Protestant movement in Mexico
has for the past year been making considerable
progress, chiefly owing to the efforts
of the American clergyman, Rev. H.
Chauncey Reilly, a letter from whom
upon this subject was forwarded by me,
forming an enclosure to my No. 38, of
August 9, 1869. There are now about
fifty congregations or assemblies of Mexican
Protestants in this city and vicinity,
and an equal or greater number scattered
throughout the country. Most of these
assemblies still meet in private houses,
though in some small places of the interior
they form a numerical majority, and
have, therefore, acquired possession of the
parish churches. In this city, through the
efforts and personal liberality of Mr.
Reilly, the Protestants have acquired two
fine churches of those which were secularized
and sold by the government some
years since; one of these is the former
convent of San Francisco, the most magnificent
as well as the first one erected in
Mexico. It is now being repaired for its
new use. The other is the commodious
church of San José de Garcia, which,
having been thoroughly repaired, was
dedicated to the Protestant service on
Sunday, the 23d instant, in the presence
of an immense multitude. Two or three
Catholic priests of some prominence
have, within the past two or three months,
joined the Protestant communion, and
two of them have ventured upon the decisive
step of matrimony. One of the recent
converts, Father Manuel Auguas,
formerly an eloquent preacher of the Dominican
Order, has become the pastor of
the new church. This event has caused
a vigorous polemic in the newspapers of
this city; the two papers considered especially
Catholic have been filled with
attacks upon the new religious movement,
while most of the other papers have
exhibited a commendable spirit of tolerance
or even of good-will toward the
Protestants. I enclose an interesting article
upon this subject from the <i>Two Republics</i>
of to-day, translated from the
<i>Federalista</i>, and written by M. Ignacio M.
Altamirano, who is considered as the
chief of the Mexican literary writers of the
present day. Yours, etc.”</p>

<p class="p1">This is the entire communication,
no other subjects being touched upon;
but the matter seems of so much importance
and of so great national interest
as to warrant the sapient Mr.
Nelson in making it the basis of a
special official despatch. Is this
gentleman the envoy of the United
States, or a commissioner appointed
by some Bible or tract society to
report on the “spread of Protestantism”
in the neighboring republic, or
does he unite the two characters in
his own person? Does he receive
the public money for puffing the
Rev. H. Chauncey Reilly, and transmitting
his diatribes and the effusions
of a certain M. Altamirano for preservation
in the archives of the nation?
If so, it is time the public
should know it. Mr. Nelson’s letter,
however, explains an incident that
occurred in Washington a few years
since. It was this: the mission to
Mexico was vacant, and it was applied
for by a gentleman every way
qualified for the post. He was thoroughly
educated, knew the Spanish
language well, and had served with
high rank and marked distinction
during the late war. He was appointed
by the President, and his
nomination by the Senate was urged
by several influential citizens, including
the then Secretary of State, the
late Mr. Seward. The committee of
the Senate refused to report his name
favorably, and, in reply to the query
of the writer what objection could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
urged against the applicant, a leading
senator replied that “he understood
him to be a very violent (meaning
practical) Catholic!” The policy of
this gentleman, like that of many
others at the national capital, was not
to send a Catholic to a Catholic country,
but one who would report on the
“spread of Protestantism,” and doubtless,
find materials for his despatches.</p>

<p>Nor must we blame the government
too severely for their injudicious
sectarian appointments. Its
views are but the reflex of popular
opinion, and, as long as we tolerate
bigotry and proscription in our popular
elections, we must expect that
those who are supposed to represent
us will follow the bad example thus
set them. The fault hitherto has
been partly ours, and the remedy is
in our own hands. This remedy
consists in discountenancing all subsidized
newspaper writers and demagogues
whose abuse and slanders
prevent good men from filling the
national and state councils; in trampling
under foot all party and religious
prejudices, and invariably voting
against those who would maintain
them; and by supporting for offices,
both at home and abroad, only
those who will attend to the public
business, and let sectarian missionaries
and the “spread of Protestantism”
alone.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c137" id="c137">A LEGEND OF S. MARTIN.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">After</span> many strifes and battles,
and after having been for years
Administrator of Thrace, Asia, and
Egypt, with Dacia and Macedonia,
to which the dethroned and executed
Emperor of the West, Gratian, had
appointed him, Theodosius I., the Roman
emperor, returned from Thessalonica,
his former headquarters, to
Constantinople.</p>

<p>The day was cold and stormy, and
many a one of the emperor’s suite
wrapped his cloak closer around his
shivering body, as the snowflakes
fell thicker and faster, covering the
road quickly in the white mantle of
winter.</p>

<p>The troop had just entered a small
village, when the emperor’s horse
was stopped by a man miserably
clad and trembling with cold.</p>

<p>Impatient of the detention, Theodosius
pressed his spurs into the sides
of his steed, and flew past the wretched
beggar.</p>

<p>But a knight called Martin, from
Pannonia, who followed next, halted
and looked pityingly upon the poor
trembling form. Willingly would he
have given him money or clothing,
but a soldier seldom has much to
give, and, except his hat and coat, the
knight possessed nothing. One moment
only he reflected, and the
next he drew forth his sword, and
cut in two the large cloak hanging
over his shoulders. Handing the
one half to the beggar, and wrapping
himself closely in the other, he followed
the emperor with lightning
speed, without listening to the words
of blessing which fell from the lips
of the mendicant.</p>

<p>After the sun had set, the emperor
and his followers took quarters for the
night.</p>

<p>All had gone to rest, and Knight
Martin also had laid himself down,
and soon was fast asleep. Shortly,
however, he felt as if his eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
forced open by a most brilliant and
dazzling light. He sat up, and perceived
at his feet a man upon whose
head was a crown of thorns. Shining
angels surrounded him, and the
mantle which Martin had given to
the beggar hung around his shoulders.
Pointing to it, he asked S. Peter
(who stood by his side) in sweet
and gentle voice: “Do you see this
mantle?”</p>

<p>“From whom did you receive it?”
S. Peter questioned.</p>

<p>“From Martin here,” was the reply,
given in a heavenly voice, his
finger pointing at the same time to
the astonished soldier. “Rise, my son,”
he then continued&mdash;and his angelic
smile was ravishing to the eyes of
Martin&mdash;“I have chosen thee henceforth
to be my servant. Until now
thou hast been a blind heathen: thou
shalt now become a shining light in my
army. Put up thy sword; thou shalt be
a soldier of God.” And then Martin
knew that it was the Lord himself
who spake to him.</p>

<p>An angel kissed the mantle’s border&mdash;and
Martin awoke.</p>

<p>The morning broke. He rose
quickly, and left the place, never
resting, never stopping, until he had
reached the portal of a cloister; there
he knocked and entered.</p>

<p>Soon he became famous for his
goodness and piety, and, as bishop,
served his Master with spiritual rather
than material weapons.</p>

<h2 class="p4">NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>

<p class="pind"><span class="smcap"><a id="c138" name="c138">My Clerical Friends</a>, and Their Relation
to Modern Thought.</span> New
York: The Catholic Publication Society.
1873.</p>

<p class="p1">We are glad to announce the publication
of the American edition of this
work, our previous notice having been
based upon the advance sheets of the
English edition.</p>

<p>The Catholic Publication Society has
done good service to religion by its handsome
edition of this most important book.
It is divided into four chapters, which
treat of “The Vocation of the Clergy,”
“The Clergy at Home,” “The Clergy
Abroad,” and “The Clergy and Modern
Thought.” Under these divisions, the
distinguished author has grouped together
a most interesting series of facts
and arguments which cannot fail to carry
conviction to any honest mind. He deals
principally with what may be called the
advanced clergy of the Anglican Church,
shows their real position in the present
state of controversy, and the utter absurdity
of their claims. If there is anything
properly called ridiculous, it is the
aspect of a small portion of a sect pretending
to be that which every one else
in the world denies them to be, and
flaunting their professions to the entire
denial of history, tradition, and even common
sense. Our Ritualistic friends have
no regard for anything in the past, present,
or future but themselves, and, therefore,
they cannot be reasoned with. Their
half-way house may be a stopping-place
for a time for honest hearts, but no sincere
mind can rest there, for Almighty
God never leaves the true in mind without
the assistance of his grace or the
use of their natural faculties. We commend
this book to all in the Anglican
communion who desire to look facts in
the face or to save their souls. And we
beg in all charity to tell them that they
cannot save their souls without sacrifice.
If they prefer to keep this world, they
will lose the next. There may be in our
author’s clear and bright presentation of
truth something that may seem to them
harsh or severe. We can assure them
that there is no kinder heart than that
of our distinguished friend, the author;
but he has such keen perceptions of right
and wrong that he cannot fail to put,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
with telling effect, the absurdity of their
religious position. And deny it as they
may, and perhaps will, the whole world
appreciates the inconsistency of their
actions with their professions. Kind
people pity them, while worldly people
laugh at them.</p>

<p>Beginning with the theory that the <i>one</i>
church of God can be divided, which is
a contradiction in terms, they claim to
be a <i>branch</i> of something that confessedly
can have no branches. Then, they are
not simply a branch, but a <i>branch of a
branch</i>. And the branch of which they
form part renounces them, and casts them
out, but they will not be cast out. Their
mother, the Church of England, does not
know herself as these her children do.
Then, there is one thing they can hang
on to the last, even if everything else fails.
They were admitted to apostolical ordination
by <i>Barlow</i>, whom they will have a
bishop, though there is no proof whatever
that he was one, and while he himself
denied the necessity or the virtue of
the sacrament of order. “If schism,” as
Dr. Newman says, “depends on the mere
retention of the Episcopal order, there
never was and there never will be a
schism,” for bishops are as likely to be
corrupted as priests. But the truth is,
nobody ever pretended to any apostolical
succession in the English Church until
the Dissenters became so strong that, out
of opposition to them, “a few Anglican
prelates began to talk of pretensions
which, during several generations, they
had treated as a jest and a fable.” “According
to Barlow, an English bishop
could dispense with orders; and, according
to Cranmer, with grace.” There was
no pretence of any doctrine of priesthood
on the part of the <i>founders</i> of the
Church of England, and surely these intelligent
men ought to have known what
they intended to do. Hooker is one of
their greatest defenders, and he expressly
denies the necessity of Episcopal ordination.
“Being about to appear before
God, he sent&mdash;not for an Anglican minister&mdash;but
for his friend Saravia, and accepted
from his unconsecrated hands
those quasi-sacramental rites which, according
to Ritualistic views, he had no
power to dispense.” These divines were
the faithful interpreters of the mind of
their church.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘It is quite clear,’ observes Bishop Tomline,
expounding the 25th Article, ‘that the words of
the Article do not maintain the necessity of episcopal
ordination.’ Bishop Hall, again, though
he wrote a well-known book in defence of episcopacy,
gave up the whole question when he
said: ‘Blessed be God, <i>there is no difference</i>, in
any essential matter, betwixt the Church of England
and <i>her sisters of the Reformation</i>.’ And
this was the language even of men who had
written the most earnest apologies for episcopal
government. They never attempted to maintain
that the apostolical succession was necessary to
the integrity of a church. Thus Bramhall said,
with easy composure: ‘The ordination of our
first Protestant bishops was <i>legal</i>,’ <i>i.e.</i> it had the
royal sanction; ‘and for the <i>validity</i> of it, we
crave no man’s favor.’ Andrewes is a more important
witness. Though Ritualists may not
approve his subservience to that robust theologian,
James I., he is still held in honor among
them as almost a High-Church prelate, and is
regarded as the most imposing figure of his time.
Yet Andrewes, on their own principles, was as
flagrant a betrayer of the doctrine of the Christian
priesthood, if he ever held it, as Hooker
himself, or even as Barlow or Whittaker. He
not only gave the Anglican sacrament to a Swiss
Protestant, Isaac Casaubon, but related afterwards,
with impassioned and approving eloquence,
that his friend died loudly professing
with his latest breath the strictest tenets of the
Calvinists of Geneva.”</p>

<p class="p1">There are many other points that will
attract the attention of the reader, and
which we cannot speak of in this short
notice. The last chapter, upon “The
Clergy and Modern Thought,” is particularly
adapted to the superficial age in
which we live, and answers all the objections
which are made by the really shallow
thinkers who, according to the language
of the apostle, “professing themselves
to be wise, have become fools.”</p>

<p>We bespeak for this most interesting
and instructive book a large circulation
and many attentive readers, who will
unite with us in thanking the accomplished
author for the pleasure and profit
they have received from him. May God
grant him yet many years to live in which
to do good with his able pen!</p>

<p>The following letter of the author, correcting
a mistake into which he had fallen,
appeared in the London <i>Tablet</i> of
February 8:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“MR. LECKY AND ‘MY CLERICAL
FRIENDS.”</p>

<p class="pn1">“<i>To the Editor of the Tablet</i>:</p>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I am assured by friends of Mr. Lecky,
the well-known author of the histories of <i>Rationalism
in Europe</i> and of <i>European Morals</i>,
that I have misunderstood a passage in the latter
work, and attributed to the distinguished writer
sentiments which he disavows. Mr. Lecky has
displayed in his remarkable writings such unusual
candor, and even, in spite of much that is
painful to a Christian, such elevation of thought,
that to do him wilful injustice is a fault of which
no Catholic ought to be capable. I ask your permission,
therefore, to make the following explanation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>“The passage which I am said to have misunderstood
is this: ‘Had the Irish peasants been
less chaste, they would have been more prosperous.
Had that fearful famine, which in the present
century desolated the land, fallen upon a
people who thought more of accumulating subsistence
than of avoiding sin, multitudes might
now be living who perished by literal starvation.’
Interpreting these words by the light of
other statements of the same author, and especially
by his announcement that ‘<i>utility</i> is perhaps
the highest motive to which reason can attain,’
they seemed to me, as they seemed to all whom
I have been able to consult, to bear only one
meaning. I was mistaken. They really meant,
I now learn, ‘that the habit of early marriages
in a nation is detrimental to its economical prosperity.’
I am further reminded that Mr. Lecky
has written admirably on the grace of chastity
which adorns the Irish nation, and could not,
therefore, have wished to say that sin is a less
evil than famine and destitution.</p>

<p>“I am too familiar with the writings of Mr.
Lecky, which I have read more than once, and
always with extreme interest, not to recognize
his great moral superiority over the contemporary
school of Rationalists. The study of his
books has even created in me a strong personal
sympathy for the writer. In quoting him frequently,
I think I have manifested this feeling.
But if I have done him injustice in the case referred
to, I regret that he did not more carefully
guard himself from a misapprehension which
was purely involuntary, and into which others
fell who share my admiration of his candor and
ability. I have only to add that, if the opportunity
should occur, I will suppress the passage to
which Mr. Lecky’s friends have called my attention.
Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="pind"><span class="smcap">Sermons on Ecclesiastical Subjects.</span>
By Henry Edward, Archbishop of
Westminster. American Edition. Vol.
II. New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This dauntless champion of the faith
is once more in the field. In the present
volume, the great Archbishop of England
presents himself in that which is his
special character and vocation, to wit, as
the defender of the rights and doctrines
maintained and promulgated by Pius IX.
in the face of his enemies and of some
timid or misguided persons among his
friends. The sermons are not all new
ones, since they range in time from 1866
to 1872; but as now collected they make
a new whole out of previously separate
parts belonging to one great theme, the
rights of the Holy See and the church as
opposed to the nefarious system of modern
liberalism. The masterpiece of the
volume is, however, the Introduction, a
most able and eloquent analysis and confutation
of the principles of the revolutionary
party in Europe which aims at
the overthrow of the Catholic Church
and of the Christian religion. Archbishop
Manning has done immense service to
religion, and his power seems to have
been continually and steadily increasing
since he first entered the lists as a champion
of the true church. Before the
Council of the Vatican, he was one of
those who contributed most efficaciously
to the preparation of the greatest event
of this age, the definition of the dogma
of Papal Infallibility, by which Gallicanism,
the mother error of that brood of
false doctrines condemned in the Syllabus
of 1864, was destroyed. During and
since the Council he has combated these
errors with equal ability and courage,
and seconded the great Pope, who now
fills the place of Christ on the earth, by
re-echoing the divine harmonies of his
doctrine through the English-speaking
world. It is most important that all our
educated laity should be thoroughly imbued
with this pure and saving doctrine,
in which alone is contained, not only the
salvation of the soul, but of sound science,
of nations, of society, and of all
human interests. We know of no such
thorough and perfect interpreter of Pius
IX., the infallible teacher of the nations,
in the English language, as the Archbishop
of Westminster. His writings
are those which ought especially to be
circulated and read among the educated
laity, as the exposition of that truth
which is the special antidote to the fatal
errors of the times. They are especially
suitable for this purpose, because they
are the writings of a bishop; and it is
to the priests of the church, and especially
to the chief priests and pastors,
to whom is committed the office not only
of teaching the faithful personally, but
of giving to the writings of the subordinate
clergy and of learned laymen the
only canonical sanction which they
possess, that the laity are to look for
instruction in sound doctrine under the
supreme authority of the Holy See.
The private opinions of a bishop have,
indeed, no more weight than is given
them by their argumentative value. This
is always very great in the writings of
Archbishop Manning, who is accustomed
to sustain his positions by a very great
force of evidence and reasoning. But a
still greater merit of his writings is found
in the fact, that he never obtrudes his
private opinions as Catholic doctrine,
or goes beyond the mark placed by the
authority of the church or the common
teaching of approved theologians. Not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
only does he avoid extenuating, but he
equally avoids exaggerating statements
respecting Catholic doctrine. And,
moreover, although of uncompromising
strictness in his orthodoxy, and apostolic
severity in his language respecting contumacious
heretics and rebels against
divine authority, he is considerate and
gentle towards those whose errors may,
in charity, be regarded as excusable. In
this respect, his writings are a model for
those who undertake the advocacy of
the great Catholic truths which are opposed
to the errors of the day. May
God preserve the worthy successor of
the great English cardinal to see the
triumph of the church in the land of S.
Edward and S. Thomas of Canterbury!</p>

Gospel for Each Day of Lent. By the
Bishop of Northampton. New York:
The Catholic Publication Society.
1873.</p>

<p class="p1">We recommend this little book to all
who wish to spend the season of Lent in
conformity with the spirit and intention
of the church. The style is simple and
chaste; the thoughts are elevated and
suggestive. There is, too, an air of serenity
and even cheerfulness about the
book which we cannot but consider as
in perfect accord with the true nature of
penance as understood by the church:</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">
“Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure<br />
Thrill the deepest notes of woe.”</p>

<p class="p1">“When you fast, be not as the hypocrites,
sad,” says the church to her children

the ages the words of her divine Spouse.</p>

Preface by His Grace the Archbishop
of Westminster. Vol. I. From the
First Sunday in Advent to the Sixth
Saturday after the Epiphany. London:
Burns &amp; Oates. 1872. (New York:
Sold by The Catholic Publication Society.)</p>

<p class="p1">The remaining three volumes of this
work, we are told, may be looked for in
the course of the present year. The
whole will form a manual of meditations
for priests to which we have seen nothing
comparable. That such a work is needed
who will deny? For if any one
ought to meditate, it is a priest; and how
few books of meditation in our language
are at all what he wants! Of the present
compilation, then, his grace the
Archbishop of Westminster, in his prefatorial
letter to his clergy, says: “In dedicating
to you this first part of Scotti’s
<i>Meditations for the Clergy</i>, I need only
add that it is a book held in high esteem
at Rome. Having found by the experience
of many years its singular excellence,
its practical piety, its abundance
of Scripture, of the fathers, and of ecclesiastical
writers, I have thought that
it would be an acceptable and valuable
addition to your books of devotion.”</p>

<p>After this recommendation, let us simply
express a wish that the work may
become known to every priest who speaks
the English language. And again let us
thank the good Oblate Fathers for one
of the most estimable services they have
ever done for religion.</p>

<p class="p1">These meditations differ very much
from ordinary compositions with that

a single one of which will suffice
the devout soul for a whole day’s food.
There is nothing stiff and formal, nothing

now with God or the saints&mdash;there
is a deep philosophy in a very simple

It is a little coarse in some

Nevertheless, it has a great likeness

of a Sister of Charity. Baltimore: J.
Murphy &amp; Co. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">The subject of this memoir was a
French lady of rank, brought up a Protestant,
but converted in early life to the
Catholic faith. It is an interesting, edifying,
and well-written, as well as beautifully
printed, little book, not at all commonplace,
but with the freshness of unusual
incidents told in the charming
style which belongs to modern English
literature of the best class.</p>

<p>There is something very attractive in
the French character when unperverted
by scepticism and frivolity. The energy,
zeal, and enthusiasm they throw into
their work for God are very captivating
to colder natures. And the higher one
ascends in the social scale, the more decided,
apparently, do these traits become.
Whereas, in other nationalities, prosperity
and position frequently have a deleterious
effect; they often bring a Frenchman’s
better qualities into higher relief.
In the religious orders, many illustrious
examples of this remark may be found&mdash;of
men brought up in ease and affluence
who have adopted the mortified life
of missionaries, braved every danger, and
courted death itself, if thereby they could
win some souls for Christ. The French
nuns and Sisters of Charity have also
been preeminent, as the unwritten history
of the late war alone would demonstrate.
The charitable spirit which lies at the
foundation of that suavity and grace too
often characterized as surface politeness,
peculiarly fits them for the delicate and
trying duties they assume.</p>

<p>In the subject of this memoir we recognize
the same winning characteristics
to which we have adverted. Of high birth,
she left all which usually attracts youthful
ambition for a life of self-abnegation
and charity. The name Eugénie, already
endeared to thoughtful readers through
the <i>Letters</i> and <i>Journal of Mlle. de Guérin</i>
(for we learn to appreciate a character
full as much through the productions of
the subject as by the portrayal of others),
will receive new lustre from the memoirs
of another saintly wearer. Such a record,
though simple, is full of beauty and edification
to those who follow in the same
path, as well as those whose sphere of
duty, though lying in the world, is yet elevated
above it.</p>

Brann, D.D. New York: D. &amp; J. Sadlier
&amp; Co. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This book is of small size, but on an
important subject, viz., the nature and
sources of certitude. It is clear, logical,
sound, and written in a good style. As
an antidote to the wretched, poisonous
trash sold under the name of philosophy,
which is nothing but methodical scepticism
and materialism, this little book
must do good if it is read and understood
by those who have need of it. The unhappy
intellectual vagrants of our day
are afflicted with the two great miseries
which poor “Jo” complained of: “Not
knowing nothink, and starwation.” Jo
often sadly muttered to himself, “I don’t
know <i>nothink</i>!” Mr. Bain and all that
set are so many Joes, repeating for ever,
“I don’t know nothink, you don’t know
nothink, nobody don’t and nobody can’t
know nothink.” The sophist of Königsberg
was a Jo of genius, nothing more.
Dr. Brann will give a substantial breakfast
to any one of these hungry Joes who
will read his book.</p>

By Louisa M. Alcott, author
of <i>Little Women</i>, <i>An Old-fashioned Girl</i>,
<i>Little Men</i>, <i>Hospital Sketches</i>. Boston:
Roberts Brothers. 1872.</p>

<p class="p1">This book is written in a light, trifling,
flippant style, which may be very pleasant
and appropriate when used to describe
certain things, but when applied
indiscriminately to all that one sees
abroad, it certainly is not agreeable, to
say the least of it. Neither is it pleasant,
in a book of travels, to find that nothing
is considered true, or even worthy of respect,
unless the <i>author</i> believes in it. A
Mass at S. Mark’s, Venice, is described
in this way: “The patriarch was a fat
old soul in red silk, even to his shoes
and holy pocket-handkerchief; and the
service appeared to consist in six purple
priests dressing and undressing him like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
an old doll, while a dozen white-gowned
boys droned up in a gold cockloft, and
many beggars whined on the floor below.”
A visit to the Carthusian Convent, Pavia,
calls forth the following comment: “A
nice way for lazy men to spend their lives,
when there is so much work to be done
for the Lord and his poor! Wanted to
shake them all round,” etc. In the description
of the inundation of parts of the
city of Rome we read: “Livy indulged
the sinful hope that the pope would get
his pontifical petticoats very wet, be a
little drowned and terribly scared by the
flood, because he spoiled the Christmas
festivities,” etc. Victor Emmanuel is
spoken of as “the honest man,” with the
remark that “that is high praise for a
king.” Such expressions as “sullen old
gentleman in the Vatican,” “silly Madonna,”
and others of the same character,
enliven the pages in various places.</p>

<p>We can scarcely believe that this book
is from the same pen as <i>Little Women</i>,
and we think it would be far better, when
one is only willing to see things through
their ignorance and prejudices, not to
attempt to make others see with their
eyes.</p>

<p class="pind"><span class="smcap"><a id="c143a" name="c143a">God</a> our Father.</span> By a Father of the
Society of Jesus, author of <i>The Happiness
of Heaven</i>. Baltimore: John Murphy
&amp; Co. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">After reading this little book, we felt
an ardent desire to tell everybody we had
found a treasure. Its title, a rather unusual
thing nowadays, is the true exponent
of its contents. That God is our
Father&mdash;our kind, indulgent, beneficent,
merciful, loving Father&mdash;it proves as we
have never seen proved before. We do
think, if Voltaire had seen this little treatise,
he would not have called God a
“tyrant and the father of tyrants,” and
he, Voltaire, would not have been a fool
and the father of a generation of fools.
Some Christians other than Calvinists
are accustomed to regard God as a stern
judge or an exacting master, ignoring altogether
his parental relationship. This
way of regarding God not unfrequently
produces a morbid spirituality, if not
worse. Under its baneful influence, the
soul is parched up and rendered incapable
of any other sentiment than that of
fear. It is true that “fear is the beginning
of wisdom”; but it is no less true
that “love is the fulfilment of the law”
and the sublime summary of the new
dispensation. And who can love a being
whom he sees only in the light of a stern
judge, an exacting master? God, as he
is represented in this work, is a being
whom you cannot but love. In very
truth, the author himself must love much,
or he could never write so eloquently of
divine love.</p>

<p>To all Catholics who look with a filial
confidence to God, and love him as their
Father, we recommend this book as a
means of strengthening their confidence
and increasing their love. To those
Catholics, happily few, who see in God
only a rigid master, we prescribe the
perusal of this work as the best remedy
for their dangerous disease. To our
separated brethren, who want to get a
Christian idea of our common Father, we
would respectfully suggest the careful
study of this treatise; they will find it
sufficiently scriptural and sufficiently
simple for their tastes.</p>

<p>We cannot, perhaps, pay the publishers
a higher compliment than by saying
that the setting is in every way worthy of
the gem.</p>

and Practices of the Catholic
Church.</span> By Cardinal Wiseman.
New York: P. O’Shea.</p>

<p class="p1">These two volumes belong to the uniform
series of Cardinal Wiseman’s works
now being issued by Mr. O’Shea, and, as
we understand, are printed from the same
plates as the one-volume edition heretofore
issued by Kelly, Piet &amp; Co.</p>

<p>It is a strong evidence of the permanent
interest which attaches to Catholic
doctrine&mdash;the faith ever ancient, ever
new&mdash;that these lectures are read now
with almost equal avidity with that which
greeted their appearance almost forty
years ago, while as many weeks suffice
to lay on the shelf the productions of
many a popular preacher of the day.</p>

<p>This course constituted the <i>Lent</i> at S.
Mary’s, Moorfields, in 1836, when the
Oxford movement had already acquired
considerable headway, and the public
mind was alive to the subjects discussed.
In view of the audience which he addressed,
they were doubtless prepared
with great care, and may therefore be
considered most favorable specimens of
the distinguished author’s style.</p>

<p>One is struck, in looking over Cardinal
Wiseman’s works, by the fact of the singular
diversity of his gifts, and his preeminence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in the varied fields of research
and discussion&mdash;as if he had made each
a specialty. His <i>Lectures on the Connection
of Science and Religion</i>, delivered the
preceding year, has maintained a position
in the front rank of works devoted
to that subject, and may be said to have
become obsolete only in so far as science
has presented new phenomena and discoveries
for elucidation; while the present
work has remained, to our thinking,
the most exhaustive popular exposition
of Catholic doctrine in the language.
His more elaborate historical and critical
essays have attracted marked attention,
and been thought worthy of publication
in separate volumes, while his distinctively
belles-lettres works have enjoyed
almost universal favor. His <i>Fabiola</i> confessedly
stands at the head of Christian
fiction. It is a little remarkable that
<i>The Hidden Gem</i>, and one of the most
acute critiques of the day upon Shakespeare,
should have been the production
of one who it is fair to infer scarcely ever-witnessed
an acted drama.</p>

<p>The same house has brought out in
similar style the <i>Four Lectures on the Offices
and Ceremonies of Holy Week</i> by the
same author, which we hope will prove a
valuable aid to the intelligent participation
in the devotions of the present season.
The interest in the Lectures is enhanced
by the fact that they were delivered
at Rome, and relate to the ceremonies
in the Papal chapels.</p>

<p class="pc1"><i>Card of the Editor of The Catholic World.</i></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">An</span> error in respect to a matter of
Catholic faith into which the author of
an article in our last number inadvertently
fell, and which escaped my notice until
it was too late to make any earlier
correction, requires me to make the present
explanation. I do it for the sake of
the reverend gentleman who first animadverted
upon this erroneous statement, and
for others at a distance who are not in a
position to know personally the utter impossibility
of any statement bordering on
“Gallicanism” being admitted into <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World</span> with the knowledge
of the editor. The passage in question
is as follows, and is found on p. 784:
“Who can wonder if the Church, in this
dire emergency, <i>delegates to one man</i> the
power she can no longer collectively exercise
in peace?” The mistake of the
writer, who is a lay Catholic and not a
theologian, is very excusable. The responsibility
for the doctrine of the articles
published rests exclusively with me, as
the editor in the absence of the Very
Rev. F. Hecker. If any statement which
is contrary to Catholic doctrine or sound
theology is allowed to pass in any article,
it is by accident, and any reverend gentleman
or layman who notices anything of
the kind will oblige me by sending a
communication to me directly, pointing
out the error. Any such communication
will receive due attention from myself
or from the editor-in-chief, when he is in
town and able to attend personally to
the duties of his office. In this connection,
I take occasion to remark that
another worthy clergyman, entirely unknown
to me, who has recently expressed
himself as aggrieved by the remarks of
<span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span> upon Italy, has
wholly misapprehended their intention.
The articles on this subject which have
appeared have been generally written by
myself, or prepared under my direction.
I have no hostility except against the
wicked party which tyrannizes over the
Catholic people of Italy, and would with
pleasure have admitted the letter of the
Italian missionary, pleading the cause
of his country, to the columns of <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World</span>. It is the aim of the
editors of <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span> to make
it Catholic in its spirit and tone of charity
and courtesy, as well as orthodox in
doctrine, and to remember that it becomes
those who profess a special loyalty
to the Holy Father to pay attention to
<i>all</i> his admonitions, especially to that one
in which he gave such an emphatic
warning against the violation of charity
by those who are very zealous for his
authority.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> question of the origin of species&mdash;the
question, namely, whether
the vegetable and animal species now
on the earth, and those which from
the study of its strata we know to be
extinct, were in the beginning called
into existence by the direct creative
<i>fiat</i>, and substantially with the forms
they now have; or whether they
have been developed from other and
pre-existing beings with forms essentially
different from their own, in
obedience to natural law&mdash;is one upon
which, since Charles Darwin published
the first edition of his book upon
the subject, now about twelve years
ago, much has been said. We may
add that the answer given to it by
Mr. Darwin has been much misunderstood.
It has been misunderstood
in <i>itself</i> by those who would not
take the trouble to inquire in what
its precise merits consisted: how
much of certainty, and how much of
mere theory, it contained; what facts
or series of facts, if admitted, it was
incompetent to throw light upon;
and whether there were any facts,
botanical or zoological, in conflict
and irreconcilable with it. It has
been misunderstood, too, <i>in its bearings
on revelation</i>, and that by two
classes of men: on the one hand, by
mere scientists, for the reason that
they knew nothing of theology, and
were therefore not in a way to decide
whether the Bible and the theory of
development are compatible with
each other; and, on the other, by
well-intentioned advocates of Christianity,
because frequently they knew
nothing of science in general&mdash;little
of this question, and the precise
meaning and worth of Darwin’s answer
to it in particular. The former
have been at fault in asserting that a
science&mdash;theology, Catholic theology,
we mean, is a science&mdash;of which they
knew nothing did not harmonize
with a hypothesis of which they
knew perhaps all that is to be known;
the latter, in not acknowledging distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the grain of truth or of certainty
contained in the speculations
of Darwin.</p>

<p>The question is an interesting one,
and has accordingly called forth a
large literature in England, Germany,
France, and Italy. Mr. Chapman’s
book is, we believe, the only one
written in this country, and professedly
devoted to the advocacy of the
theory that, to use the author’s own
words, “the development of the
higher forms of life from the lower
has been brought about by natural
selection, and that man has descended
from a lower extinct form of which
the gorilla and chimpanzee are the
nearest living representatives”&mdash;which
is Darwinism pure and simple,
and which ought to be distinguished
from the more general theory of
“evolution.” That Mr. Chapman’s
book has been published in America,
and that we wish to say a few words
on the question which it treats, and
especially on the bearings of that
question on revealed religion, constitute
its only claims on our attention;
for neither the style of the writer nor
the lucidity of his argument, much
less its originality, entitles it to any
particular notice. The work is a
mere compilation, which, however,
may be of service to those who desire
to possess in a convenient shape
the facts, and to examine the nature
of the reasoning, by which the Darwinian
hypothesis is supported.</p>

<p>When we have said this, and that
Mr. Chapman devotes a chapter of
his book to the argument from zoology,
geology, embryology, etc., respectively,
in favor of Darwinism; that
these arguments are neither as elegant,
scholarly, or cogent as they
might be made; that he has followed
the materialists of Germany in their
version of the theory, and further than
there is even the shadow of a warrant
to follow it, we have said all
that we wish to say about his book,
and bestowed upon it the highest
praise it is in our power to bestow
consistently with truth.</p>

<p>What our views on the Darwinian
theory are will appear in the sequel.
Here we wish simply to say a few
words on certain doctrines drawn
from it by Mr. Chapman, or, if not
drawn from it, associated with it both
by him and others&mdash;doctrines which,
in our view, are not part and parcel
of it because mere assumptions in no
way countenanced by facts. Thus, Mr.
Chapman desires us expressly to understand
that “natural selection,” the
meaning of which we will explain in
a moment, does not imply the existence
of a “natural selector”; and
this, without any forced interpretation,
may be construed into a profession of
atheism. Now, as we will see a little
further on, the admission of the Darwinian
theory does not necessarily
lead to any such conclusion. Again,
he informs us, p. 14, that life is only a
“physical phenomenon, and that
the nervous system produces ideas
and all the acts of intelligence”&mdash;which
is rank materialism. That
Mr. Chapman advocates fatalism is
no less plain, for he assures us that
morality is necessarily progressive.
On the last page of his book, he defines
morals to be “duty to one’s
self.” We confess that we do not
understand how he reconciles his
assertion that morality is necessarily
progressive with his definition of
morals. It seems to us that, if necessarily
moral, men will necessarily do
their duty; or rather, they will have
no duty to do, since necessity and
duty exclude each other. According
to this theory, there can be no
distinction between good and evil,
and all the crimes that are committed
are the necessary consequences
of man’s origin. Indeed, the author
tells us, p. 180: “Crimes and outrages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
are committed even among the
most civilized, simply, in the words of
Mr. Spencer, because man ‘partially
retains the characteristics that adapted
him for an antecedent state. The
respects in which he is not fitted to
society are the respects in which he
is fitted for his original predatory
life. His primitive circumstances
required that he should sacrifice the
welfare of other beings to his own;
his present circumstances require
that he should not do so; and in
as far as his old attribute still clings
to him, in so far he is unfit for the
social state. All sins of men against
each other, from the cannibalism of
the Carib to the crimes and venalities
we see around us, have their causes
comprehended under this generalization.’”</p>

<p>Now, if all this be so, we cannot
see why murder, or robbery, or any
other crime, is not perfectly legitimate.
If to the exercise of his “old
attributes” in the struggle for existence
man owes his “survival” and
his place among the fittest, in any
degree, however small; and if there
be nothing in man not produced by
natural selection, we cannot see why
he should not even now continue the
exercise of these “attributes”; in other
words, we do not see why any propensity,
passion, or inclination originated
by the agency of “natural selection,”
to the exclusion of all other
agencies, cannot legitimately be exercised
to the full extent to which
“natural selection” has developed it.
If man exercises these “attributes”
simply in obedience to a law of nature,
we should not if we could, nor
could we if we would, resist them.
If, indeed, these views of morality be
correct, then might is right, the Decalogue
a code against nature, civilization
an abnormal condition for man,
and barbarism his only true state.</p>

<p>So much for the atheism, materialism,
and fatalism, we do not say of
Darwin&mdash;for we have reason to believe
that that gentleman himself is
none of these&mdash;but of Mr. Chapman’s
version of evolution. There is one
very important point, however, on
which Mr. Darwin, the man of
science, and the compiler, Mr. Chapman,
are at one&mdash;a point of very
great consideration because of its
bearings on revelation&mdash;the doctrine
that the difference between man and
the lower animals is not one of
“kind,” but of “degree.” We do
not wish to argue this point here in
full. What we wish to say is that
men of the school of Darwin, etc.,
should be the very last persons in
the world to make an assertion of
this character, for the reason that
they confine our knowledge to appearances,
to phenomena. The question,
however, whether man and the
lower animals differ in “kind” or
only in “degree” is not a question
of phenomena or appearances: it is a
question of <i>noumena</i>, of essence, of
reality. We do not grant that even
appearances warrant the assertion
that man differs from the lower animals
in nothing essential. There are
appearances which forbid any such
conclusion. But we maintain that,
whether they so differ or not, Darwin
and his school are, by the principles
of their philosophy, estopped from
asserting that they do or do not.
They cannot say that the same phenomena
imply the same noumena,
the same accidents, the same essence,
the same appearances, the same
reality, because, to assert the identity
of nature of two things, both must be
known in what constitutes their essence,
whereas these men expressly
say that of noumena, reality, or essence
nothing can be known.</p>

<p>Mr. Chapman is more a disciple
of Haeckel than of Darwin, and follows
that gentleman in all his vagaries&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
course well calculated to increase
rather than decrease the
amount of prejudice against what
there may be of truth in Darwinism.
Among the advocates of this, as of almost
all theories, there are extremists.
Our author seems to have gone to
school to all of them, and swallowed
all they told him, no matter how
paradoxical, no matter how little
proof to substantiate it. On the other
hand, of all that has been said
against pure Darwinism, not a word
has been recorded by Mr. Chapman;
and of those who, like Prof. Agassiz,
do not agree with Mr. Darwin, or
who, like St. George Mivart, have, as
we think, dealt his theory blows from
which it will not recover, he does not
make the smallest mention. Yet it
cannot be that Agassiz and Mivart
are too small to be noticed by Mr.
Chapman. Agassiz is too venerable
a name in science to need any demonstration
that his opinion on scientific
matters is entitled to consideration.
Mivart is, we take it, a
younger man; yet, if he has not
made himself an abiding reputation
by what he has the modesty to call
his “little book,” the <i>Genesis of
Species</i>, he has made a name which
must live, if Darwin’s, and Lyell’s, and
Huxley’s do; since all these men
have found in him a foe worthy of
their steel&mdash;and the latter of the vials
of his wrath.</p>

<p>We would not consider this article
complete without a condensed history
of the controversy between Mr.
Huxley and Mr. Mivart, occasioned
by the publication by the latter of his
admirable work, the <i>Genesis of
Species</i>. We give it here for this, as
well as for the reason that it will
serve as the best general answer it is
in our power to give to Mr. Chapman
and other writers of his character.</p>

<p>But first a few remarks on Darwin’s
theory. It is only a theory,
a mere hypothesis. Mr. Darwin
does not pretend to have proved
it himself; nor does his advocate,
Mr. Huxley, who seems to have
taken Mr. Darwin and the Darwinian
theory under his special protection,
pretend that it is proved.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that the Darwinian
theory is only a hypothesis, we
must estimate its value as we estimate
that of other hypotheses, viz.,
by its ability to account for all the
facts of which it pretends to be the
solution.</p>

<p>The Copernican system of astronomy,
for instance, is only a hypothesis;
yet, as there is no known astronomical
fact absolutely contradictory
to it, we accept it as true. If there
were only one fact which it did not
explain and could not explain; above
all, if there were one fact at variance
with the hypothesis, the hypothesis
must give way, and the fact stand;
for one fact is worth a thousand
hypotheses, and one fact in cases of
this kind, as Mr. Huxley says, as
good as five hundred.</p>

<p>Are there, then, any facts which the
Darwinian theory of development by
natural selection should explain and
does not? Mr. Huxley himself says
there is one set of such facts&mdash;the
facts of hybridism; and, as we will
presently see, there are a great many
others.</p>

<p>To St. George Mivart, a scientist,
but more than a scientist, a philosopher
in a degree, somewhat of a theologian
as well, and therefore a man
of greater intellectual grasp than
either Darwin or Huxley, we are
indebted for the fullest presentation
of the facts inexplicable by natural
selection that has yet been given to
the reading world. This that gentleman
has done in his book before
referred to, <i>The Genesis of Species</i>.</p>

<p>One of Mr. Mivart’s great merits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
is that he accords to Mr. Darwin’s
theory its full meed of praise. He is
a scientific man, and as such a good
judge of its merits and demerits,
therefore competent to acknowledge
the one and point out the other.</p>

<p>We are not at all prejudiced
against Mr. Darwin or his theory.
We agree entirely with Mr. Mivart
that it “is perhaps the most interesting
theory, in relation to natural
science, which has been promulgated
during the present century.” Before
pointing out, however, why it is the
most interesting theory of the kind,
let us see in brief what the Darwinian
theory of natural selection is.</p>

<p>In the words of Mr. Mivart it may
be stated thus:</p>

<p>1. “Every kind of animal and plant
tends to increase in numbers in a
geometrical proportion.</p>

<p>2. “Every kind of animal and plant
transmits a general likeness with individual
differences to its offspring.</p>

<p>3. “Every individual may present
minute variations of any kind in any
direction.</p>

<p>4. “Past time has been practically
infinite.</p>

<p>5. “Every individual has to endure
a very severe struggle for existence,
owing to the tendency to geometrical
increase of all kinds of animals and
plants, while the total animal and
vegetable population (man and his
agency excepted) remains almost
stationary.</p>

<p>6. “Thus, every variation of a kind
tending to save the life of the individual
possessing it, or to enable it
more surely to propagate its kind,
will in the long run be preserved,
and will transmit its favorable peculiarity
to some of its offspring, which
peculiarity will thus become intensified
till it reaches the maximum
degree of utility. On the other hand,
individuals presenting unfavorable
peculiarities will be ruthlessly destroyed.
The action of this law of
‘natural selection’ may thus be
well represented by the convenient
expression, ‘survival of the fittest.’”</p>

<p>Now as to the series of facts which
this theory throws light upon. Here
they are as enumerated by Mr. Mivart.
It explains:</p>

<p>1. Some singular facts “relating to
the geographical distribution of animals
and plants; as, for example, on
the resemblance between the past and
present inhabitants of different parts
of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>2. “That often, in adjacent islands,
we find animals closely resembling
and appearing to represent each other;
while, if certain of these islands show
signs of more ancient separation, the
animals inhabiting them exhibit a
corresponding divergence.</p>

<p>3. That “‘rudimentary structures’
also receive an explanation by means
of this theory.</p>

<p>4. “That the singular facts of
‘homology’ are capable of a similar
explanation.”</p>

<p>5. That “that remarkable series
of changes which animals undergo
before they attain their adult condition,
which is called their process of
development, and during which they
more or less closely resemble other
animals during the early stages of the
same process, has also great light
thrown on it from the same source.”</p>

<p>6. That “by this theory, and as
yet by this alone, can any explanation
be given of that extraordinary
phenomenon which is metaphorically
termed ‘mimicry.’”</p>

<p>To explain in detail the exact import
of each of these heads would
carry us beyond the limits of a magazine
article; and the reader who
wishes for more minute and definite
information on them we must refer
to Mivart’s own book, or to Darwin’s
<i>Origin of Species</i>.</p>

<p>Pass we now to those facts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Darwin’s theory is incompetent to
explain, and to the arguments against
it. Mr. Mivart enumerates them
thus:</p>

<p>1. “That ‘natural’ selection is
incompetent to account for the incipient
stages of useful structures.</p>

<p>2. “That it does not harmonize
with the coexistence of closely similar
structures of diverse origin.</p>

<p>3. “That there are grounds for
thinking that specific differences may
be developed suddenly instead of
gradually.</p>

<p>4. “That the opinion that species
have definite though very different
limits to their variability is still tenable.</p>

<p>5. “That certain fossil transitional
forms are absent which might have
been expected to be present.</p>

<p>6. “That some facts of geographical
distribution supplement other
difficulties.</p>

<p>7. “That the objection drawn
from the physiological difference between
‘species’ and ‘races’ still exists
unrefuted.”</p>

<p>Our readers will readily understand
that, if species, or rather individual
animals, were originated by natural
law, and if that law be “natural
selection,” the action of “natural
selection” must be able to explain
not only the production of the animal
as a whole, but of its several organs,
both when they have reached the
point of maximum utility, and at all
stages previous thereto.</p>

<p>Mr. Mivart shows that it does not
accomplish this; that it does not account
for “the incipient stages of
useful structures, <i>e. g.</i> the heads of
flatfishes, the baleen of whales, vertebrate
limbs, the laryngeal structures
of the new-born kangaroo, the pedicellariæ
of echinoderms”; and thus
he established his first charge on
purely scientific grounds, as a scientist
writing for scientists. The other
charges are equally well sustained.
It would, however, require the rewriting
of Mr. Mivart’s book to follow
him through all his facts and arguments,
and we must beg again to refer
the reader who would study the matter
in detail, to the book itself.</p>

<p>Another series of objections brought
forward by Mr. Mivart against the
same theory is equally well sustained&mdash;objections
that go to show that “it
cannot be applied at least to the
soul of man,” as Mr. Darwin has
applied it.</p>

<p>Here, again, everyone will see that,
if the human soul is not created by
God, it, too, must have been gradually
evolved from what, for lack of a more
convenient term, though not without
protest, we must call an animal soul,
by the process of natural selection;
and therefore there is nothing in
man’s soul which was not in the ape’s&mdash;the
same faculties, moral and intellectual,
in kind, different only in degree.
This question Mr. Mivart
discusses in a separate chapter on
“Evolution and Ethics.”</p>

<p>The result of the discussion he
thus sums up:</p>

<p>1. “Natural selection could not
have produced, from the sensations
of pleasure and pain experienced in
brutes, a higher degree of morality
than was useful; therefore it could
have produced any amount of ‘beneficial
habits,’ but not an abhorrence
of certain acts as impure and sinful.</p>

<p>2. “It could not have developed
that high esteem for acts of care and
tenderness to the aged and infirm
which actually exists, but would
rather have perpetuated certain low
social conditions which obtain in
some savage localities.</p>

<p>3. “It could not have evolved
from ape sensations the noble virtues
of a Marcus Aurelius, or the loving
but manly devotion of a S. Louis.</p>

<p>4. “That it alone could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
given rise to the maxim, <i>Fiat justitia,
ruat cœlum</i>.</p>

<p>5. “That the interval between material
and formal morality is one altogether
beyond its power to traverse.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mivart further shows “that
the anticipatory character of moral
principles is a fatal bar to that explanation
of their origin which is
offered to us by Mr. Herbert Spencer”;
and “that the solution of that
origin proposed recently by Sir John
Lubbock is a mere version of simple
utilitarianism, appealing to the pleasure
or safety of the individual, and
therefore utterly incapable of solving
the riddle it attacks.”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary that we
should dwell on these points. Our
Christian readers need no demonstration
of them. Knowing, on the one
hand, what Christian morality is, and,
on the other, what mere animal behavior,
they must know the difference
between them, and, knowing
this difference, that by no possibility
could the one be developed from the
other, there being no oneness of kind
in them.</p>

<p>Just here we would remark that, in
addition to his other arguments, Mr.
Mivart might have added that from
philology against Darwinism, and
with good effect. There are those
who, from that science, argue the
other way. But, in a series of able
articles on “Darwinism and the Science
of Language,” the Rev. J. Knabenbauer,
S. J., has shown that philology
points to a diversity of origin for
man and the lower animals.</p>

<p>He argues that the ultimate elements,
the roots of all language, are
expressive of general ideas. Now,
general ideas are the products of the
intellectual processes known as abstraction
and generalization. Hence,
before the formation of roots, before
the beginnings of language, man
was man, since he could abstract
and generalize. Hence, also, language
is not a development of animal
cries, nor man of the brute, since the
brute can neither abstract nor generalize.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Mivart shows in his
chapter on “Evolution and Theology”
that evolution and creation by no
means exclude one another; and
that a Catholic&mdash;Mr. Mivart is a
Catholic&mdash;may accept the theory of
evolution, ancient writers of authority
in the church having “asserted abstract
<i>principles</i> such as can perfectly
<i>harmonize</i> with the requirements of
modern science,” and, “as it were,
provided for the reception of its most
advanced speculations.”</p>

<p>In support of this view, Mr. Mivart
quotes from S. Augustine, S. Thomas,
Cornelius à Lapide, and refers
to the Jesuit Suarez, with the doctrines
of all of whom it is perfectly
consistent to hold that animal species
were created only potentially, <i>potentialiter
tantum</i>.</p>

<p>By that we do not mean to insinuate
that the naked Darwinian theory
is compatible with Catholic faith;
but of this more hereafter.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that Mr.
Mivart, in his criticism on Darwinism,
would meet with no opponents. He
must have expected to be attacked
from two quarters, and by two different
classes of men: by those committed
to the Darwinian hypothesis, in the
first place; and, again, by those who
value that hypothesis less for its
scientific merit than for&mdash;as they
suppose&mdash;its incompatibility with
Christian doctrine, and the service
they think it might render in the disintegration
of the Christian societies.
Among the latter we are compelled
to class Mr. Huxley, who, if a very
good scientist, is, notwithstanding,
one of the most arrogant of men.</p>

<p>He replied to Mr. Mivart, and in
his reply does neither more nor less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
than constitute himself the infallible
teacher of all mankind, the supreme
pontiff of science, empowered to
speak with authority on all matters
pertaining to religion and philosophy,
as well as to anatomy. He has the
commendable modesty, even, to tell
Catholics what they may believe, and
what they must reject. He interprets
the Bible for them, expounds the
teachings of the Fathers of the church,
comments on the schoolmen, all for
their benefit; in fact, entirely forgets
the good old maxim, “Let the cobbler
stick to his last,” and imagines
that, because he has learned a considerable
amount about brains and stomachs&mdash;dead
brains and stomachs,
for the most part&mdash;he can legislate
for the Christian world; that anything
in heaven or on earth which he cannot
weigh or measure, upon which
he cannot bring the knife, or the blowpipe,
or the spectroscope to bear, does
not exist, or exist otherwise than as
it takes form in his own by no means
humble mind.</p>

<p>In his reply to Mr. Mivart, he virtually
passes over all of the latter
gentleman’s scientific objections, and
fastens on his assertion that evolution
is at all <i>compatible</i> with Catholic
doctrine.</p>

<p>Mr. Mivart had, as we have seen,
referred to Suarez, and that, Mr. Mivart
assures us, because, in Mr. Huxley’s
words, “the popular repute
of that learned theologian and subtle
casuist was not such as to make his
works a likely place of refuge for
liberality of thought.”</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Mivart did not intend
to represent Suarez or the other
writers we have mentioned above as
advocating the very modern doctrine
of evolution, but only abstract principles
harmonizing with it; and, if anything,
broader than it, inasmuch as
they are broad enough not only to
take in the recent theory of evolution,
but any other theory of development
which may be yet advocated; yet
Mr. Huxley assumed that Mr. Mivart
meant to convey the impression that
F. Suarez was a Darwinian or a disciple
of Herbert Spencer, which he
could not well be, having lived some
centuries too early to enjoy any such
good-fortune. Having erected this
theory, Mr. Huxley went, in his “More
Criticisms on Darwin,” deliberately to
work to demolish it, in doing which
he left his way considerably, raising
questions on which Mr. Mivart had
said nothing whatever, and which in
the discussion are wholly irrelevant;
as, for instance, the meaning of the
word “day” in the first chapter of
Genesis, as advocated by some authorities.</p>

<p>Mr. Mivart retorted through the
pages of the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, and
demonstrated that Suarez was “an
opponent of the theory of a perpetual
direct creation of organisms,” and
“that the principles of scholastic theology
are such as <i>not to exclude</i> the
theory of development, but rather to
favor it.” He quoted again from
Suarez, to show that that writer, treating
of the opinion that individuals of
kinds like the mule, leopard, lynx, etc.,
must have been created from the
beginning, expressed the view that
the contrary seemed to him more
probable, thus asserting <i>the principle</i>
that those kinds of animals which
are <i>potentially</i> contained in nature need
not be supposed to be directly and
immediately created. More than
this, Mr. Mivart shows that the
same authority recognizes the possibility
that certain organisms may be
originated directly from the inorganic
world by cosmical influences.</p>

<p>Our readers already know what
were the views of S. Augustine on this
matter. Mr. Mivart shows that other
theologians besides S. Thomas, such
as S. Bonaventure, Albertus Magnus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Denis the Carthusian, Cardinal
Cajetan, Melchior Canus, Bannes,
Vincentius Contenson, Macedo and
Cardinal Noris, Tosti, Serri, “and
others down to the present day,”
agree with S. Augustine in his views
on the question we are considering.</p>

<p>The great result&mdash;the only result
in which we feel especially interested&mdash;of
this controversy was the bringing into
clearer light the fact that the kernel
of truth contained in Darwinism
or in evolution is not at variance
with revelation, as indeed it cannot
be and be true. This is what Mr.
Huxley has done for the church.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Huxley’s treatment of his
opponent’s objections on the score
of morality we have nothing to say
which would be of the least service
to our readers.</p>

<p>Remains the question: How far
may a Catholic accept the special
Darwinian theory or the doctrine of
evolution? Mr. Mivart asserts that
a miraculous origin of the body of
man is not necessary; that it might
have been evolved from that of some
lower being by natural law. Darwinians
and evolutionists generally
maintain an analogous origin for the
human soul. Is there anything in
this contrary to revelation?</p>

<p>We have not space, if we had the
ability, to go into a lengthy examination
of this question. Nor is there
any reason that we should. It has
already received the attention of able
Catholic writers, and we can do no
better than give the results of their
investigation. They have shown<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
that, with respect to all organisms
lower than man, the doctrine of the
fathers is that Catholic faith “does
not prevent any one from holding
the opinion that life, both vegetable
and animal, was in the world in
germ at its creation, and afterwards
developed by regular process into all
the various species now on the
earth”; therefore, that “all living
things up to man exclusively were
evolved by natural law out of minute
life-germs primarily created, or even
out of inorganic matter,” is an opinion
which a Catholic may consistently
hold if he thinks fit so to do.</p>

<p>As to the question of the <i>body</i> of
man, the same writers have shown,
and we take it to be the safer opinion&mdash;in
which, perhaps, we differ from
Mr. Mivart&mdash;“that to question the
immediate and instantaneous (or
quasi-instantaneous) formation by
God of the bodies of Adam and Eve&mdash;the
former out of inorganic matter,
the latter out of the rib of Adam&mdash;is
at least rash, and probably proximate
to heresy.”</p>

<p>That the human soul was specially
and separately created is an article
of Catholic faith.</p>

<p>There is not a fact in science at
variance with these views of the origin
of the body of man and of the
human soul. Even Mr. Wallace&mdash;to
whom the credit of pointing
out the influence of “natural selection”
in modifying organic beings belongs
by right of a title not less valid
than that of Mr. Darwin&mdash;believes,
and he has reason to believe, in the
action of an overruling Intelligence in
the production of “the human form divine”;
and that, in view of man’s special
attributes, “he is, indeed, a being
apart”&mdash;not, therefore, evolved,
either as to his body or his soul, from
any inferior organism. When a man
like Mr. Wallace holds such a view, we
may rest assured that the facts in the
case do not require any one to hold
the contrary. Let us now endeavor
to sum up the results in relation to
the Darwinian theory and the bearings
thus far obtained:</p>

<p>1. The tendency of every kind of
animal and plant to increase in geometrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
progression, and to transmit
a general likeness with individual
differences, as well as to present minute
variations of any kind in any
direction, the great length of past
time, the struggle of animals and
plants for existence, and the preservation
and intensification of favorable
variations, are facts on which
the theory is based.</p>

<p>We accept these facts.</p>

<p>2. We do not accept the theory,
because, although it throws light on
some facts, there are others with
which it is not compatible; and because
those even on which it does
throw light do not require us to accept
it.</p>

<p>3. There is nothing in the Darwinian
theory, or in the more general
theory of evolution countenanced by
facts bearing on the development of
life, which a Catholic may not accept,
if he wishes so to do.</p>

<p>4. The teaching of Darwinism as to
the origin of man’s body is probably
next to heretical. At all events, the
only safe opinion is that it was not
evolved from the body of a lower
being, but was directly and quasi-instantaneously
created by God.</p>

<p>5. Its teaching concerning the origin
of the human soul is in direct and
irreconcilable contradiction with an
article of Catholic faith.</p>

<p>6. There is&mdash;apart from revealed
doctrine&mdash;an absolute scientific certainty
of the truth of that same doctrine
respecting the creation of the
human soul, and the highest probability
of the immediate creation of
the human body.</p>

<p>So much for the facts, so much for
the theory, so much for its bearings
on revelation.</p>

<p>In all we have said, we do not
wish to be understood as advocating
the Darwinian theory, even in so far
as it does not conflict with Catholic
faith, nor as committing ourselves
to the general doctrine of evolution.
The fact is, we do not care as Catholics
to pledge ourselves hastily to any
hypothesis whatever. We know
some little of the history of hypotheses,
and we know that it has been a
history of failures.</p>

<p>When the Darwinian hypothesis or
the theory of evolution shall have
stood the test of years and facts, and
the most searching investigations, let
the Catholics who will be then alive
accept them. There is no special
reason why we should profess our
faith in them. We do not need them
to account for the phenomena about
us.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we can readily
understand why a certain class of
minds should subscribe to it.</p>

<p>The human mind naturally seeks
for an explanation of the origin of
things. Intelligent men know the
human race has not always been on
the earth, that the phenomena about
us are not eternal, that animal and
vegetable life must have had a beginning
here. Catholics know the same,
and knew it before science had demonstrated
it or discovered its minutiæ.</p>

<p>Men who wish to get rid of God
welcome any hypothesis which seems
to remove him to a greater distance
from them, even before that hypothesis
has more in its favor than against a
it. Catholics, who believe in God,
have no such anxiety. They are
willing to wait, since they have already
an explanation of the origin
of things in their belief in God, and
in the teachings of his revelation that
he in the beginning created the
heavens and the earth, and all that
they contain. The minutiæ, the How
of that creation, they leave it to science
to discover. When discovered
and proved, they will accept it. But
science can never give them anything
not contained in the first article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of the Creed: “I believe in God the
Father Almighty, Creator of heaven
and earth.” All it can do is to explicate
and confirm this.</p>

<p>If it be objected that scientists accept
the theory, and that we therefore
should, we reply, <i>mere</i> scientists do;
and of all men, the least safe of
guides is the mere scientist. No
other man is more apt to become
a blind worshipper of the idols of the
Cave. He confines himself within
the narrow limits of his laboratory,
among instruments of death, and
then would excogitate a solution to
the problems of life and of the universe;
as if with bolts and screws
he could wring from nature the secret
it will not yield.</p>

<p>Goethe well knew that from such
men we need not expect the answer
to the riddle of the universe; that
one glance at the world as a whole
as it lies bathed in the sun on a summer’s
day tells us more than all the
tomes of philosophers.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Ah me! this dungeon still I see,<br />
This drear, accursed masonry,<br />
Where even the welcome daylight strains<br />
But darkly through the painted panes,<br />
Hemmed in by many a toppling heap<br />
Of books worm-eaten, gray with dust,<br />
Which to the vaulted ceiling creep,<br />
Against the smoky paper thrust,<br />
With glasses, boxes, round me stocked,<br />
And instruments together hurled,<br />
Ancestral lumber stuffed and packed:<br />
Such is my world: and what a world!<br />
And do I ask wherefore my heart<br />
Falters, oppressed with unknown needs?<br />
With some inexplicable smart<br />
All movement of my life impedes?<br />
Alas! in living nature’s stead,<br />
Where God his human creature set<br />
In smoke and mould, the fleshless dead<br />
And bones and beasts surround me yet!”</p>

<p class="p1">And although we can see some
force in the general theory of evolution,
we cannot accept it till it settles
its account with the principle on
which the whole inductive method is
raised&mdash;the constancy of the laws of
nature.</p>

<p>The theory of evolution strikes, it
seems to us, at the very root of this
principle. It proclaims that there is
not and has never been any constancy
in nature. It devours all other
law, or rather destroys it. It means
simply change. Permanency, constancy,
and their synonymes are opposed
to it; and thus the theory of
evolution must invalidate all the sciences
which are founded on the
assumption that nature is constant;
in other words, that it does not
change, does not evolve. The definition
of evolution given by Mr. Spencer
makes it simply a change. True,
he states the method or law of that
change. But the method is discovered
by induction. Induction is in
turn annihilated by evolution. The
fabric as it rises loses its foundation,
and floats in the air, a baseless vision.</p>

<p>But if we are in no haste to yield
assent to Darwinism or evolution in
general; as applied to man’s soul by
advocates like Spencer or Chapman,
we reject it <i>in toto</i>. It is incompetent
to account for the facts, nay, in glaring
contradiction to them.</p>

<p>We take our stand against man’s
relation to the ape on facts as undeniable
as any the zoologist or anatomist
advances in its favor. These
compare man’s body and the ape, and
<i>find</i> no very great superiority of the
one over the other as they lie recently
dead on the anatomist’s table. Let
the two lie there only a little longer,
and none at all will be discoverable.
A little dust which the winds of heaven
will soon scatter to the four
points of the compass is all that will
be left of either. Shall we therefore
infer their oneness of kind? By no
means.</p>

<p>We know that man is in some respects
not unlike the ape in form; but
we know, too, that there are Godlike
faculties in man which are not in
the ape. We know this, and we
know, moreover, that the philosopher
through whose brain roll vast choruses
of thought; who stands on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
heights of Christian philosophy and
human speculation, and discourses
on death and immortality; who, from
the eminence to which Christianity
has raised him, looks down, not with
indifference and not with contempt,
but with deep serenity, on the little
loves and little hates of the world,
because conscious of his eternal destiny&mdash;we
know, we have an intuition,
which we trust more than we trust
Darwin and Huxley, that this philosopher
is more than a developed
ape.</p>

<p>And when the anatomist tells us
there is little anatomical difference
between man and the ape, therefore
between man as man and the ape as
ape there is little difference or a difference
only of degree, we reply: Between
man and the ape, between a
Newton or even a savage and a monkey,
there is, in the intellectual order,
a vast difference, an infinite difference.
<i>This</i> we take as the fact, and
draw the conclusion that the amount
of anatomical difference between a
monkey and a man is no criterion or
measure of the real difference.</p>

<p>We treat the argument from embryology
in the same way. Because
at a certain stage in its development
the human embryo cannot be distinguished
from that of certain of the
lower animals, we are assured that
man differs from these only in degree.
We grant the fact, we reject the inference;
and we reason: notwithstanding
you can detect no difference
at certain stages between the two,
time develops one so great that the
one may become a Shakespeare, the
other becomes only a Shakespeare’s
dog. What follows? Simply this:
that there is a something in the human
embryo which is not in the other&mdash;a
something which the sense cannot
detect, but the existence of which the
mind may infer; that there is more of
life than the embryologist can find
out by his methods, as there is more
of the rose than is found in its ashes&mdash;more
of life than we would be apt to
see in a dissecting-room or a charnel-house.</p>

<p>No; whatever force the special
Darwinian theory may have to the
student of animal life, to the student
of man as an animal, it can have
very little to him who views man in
his higher manifestations. Whatever
else it may account for, it never can
throw any light on the facts of man’s
moral nature. It never can explain
the origin of a being who believes in
purity or pity.</p>

<p>Let the Darwinian, indeed, explain,
if he can, how, if man owes his existence
and his development, physical,
moral, and mental, to success in the
struggle for existence&mdash;in other words,
to natural selection&mdash;and this success,
in turn, to the exercise of the selfish
or combative faculties, or to both
combined&mdash;faculties which, according
to this theory, he must have exercised,
his present and previous states taken
together, for ages unnumbered&mdash;so
long, indeed, that they ought to have
grown into uncontrollable instincts&mdash;and
which are the only ones he can
have exercised from the beginning, to
which, therefore, as the most imperious,
all others should be subordinate&mdash;let
him, we say, explain who can
how this tendency to battle, inherited
through infinite ages, has not
taken complete possession of man,
nor caused his life to be a continual
strife with his fellows; let him explain
how, instead of all this, there <i>are</i> men
who have learned, not to hate, but to
love their enemies, to compassionate
the weak, the poor, and the lowly, to
nurse the sick and the dying, to care
even for the dead; nay, how it comes
that there are men who are guided
by the sublime command: “Love
them that hate you, bless them that
curse you, pray for them that persecute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and calumniate you”; or,
further yet, how, in spite of the exercise
of the selfish and combative
faculties, in the struggle for existence,
the tendency of which must have
been to strengthen by use the organs
of destruction, the same organs
should gradually disappear, and that
in man not one of them should be left.</p>

<p>Let him explain, again, how out of
mere animality, by “natural selection,”
out of the mere brute, in a “struggle
for existence,” beings should come&mdash;men
to whom this would be a law:
Be pure; for “he that looketh after a
woman to lust after her hath already
committed adultery with her in his
heart.” There are such men&mdash;men to
whom this is a law, and who obey it.
Will a Vogt or a Büchner believe
it? Will a Darwin account for it by
“natural selection”?</p>

<p>Finally, let him explain how, if
man has always been only growing
out of some lower condition, he has
yet learned, in a measure, to go beyond
himself, to harbor an ideal which
he has never reached, but towards
which he ever strives, inasmuch as he
endeavors to fulfil the command of
the Son of God: “Be ye perfect, as
my heavenly Father also is perfect.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c157" name="c157">PEACE.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">This</span> supplication of the Suffering
was that also of the Militant Church,
which daily offered it as now with
sighs and tears, and, by the light
which this reflection casts on history,
we can catch a glimpse for an instant
at the immense multitude of the
pacific men who in the middle ages
were existing upon earth; for as
many as were joined in spirit to the
church, were united with her in this
ardent, insatiable desire of peace.
How do we know that the Catholic
Church, which the holy Fathers call
the house of peace, was so profoundly
attached to peace? From a simple
review of her liturgy: for in the
first place, her great daily sacrifice
itself was nothing else but the mystery
of peace, the pledge of future
and eternal, the diffusion of present
peace to man. At this holy and tremendous
celebration in which God
hath given peace reconciling the
lowest with the highest in himself,
the good of temporal peace was also
formally invoked, at the <i>Gloria</i>, at the
<i>Te igitur</i>, at the spreading of the hands
before the consecration, at the <i>Libera
nos</i> at the salutation of the people, at
the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, at the three prayers
which follow it, and in the prayer
for the king; for as the apostle assigns
the reason for the latter, <i>that we
may lead a secure and peaceable life</i>,
so with that intention the holy church
prays for all rulers, even for such as
are transgressors of the divine law;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
which intention is formally expressed
in her solemn litany, where she prays
that kings and Christian princes may
have peace and true concord, and all
the people peace and unity. The
innumerable priests, who celebrated
throughout the earth, knew that the
inestimable price of the world, and the
great Victim for the salvation of men,
could only be immolated in a spirit of
peace, and with a contrite heart; and
that, as Peter of Blois says, it is never
lawful to offer it without that preparation.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Digby</span>,

<p class="pp6i">The others next, full sweetly and devout,<br />

<p class="pp6i">Whence I, unknowing which way to expect<br />
This object, turned me, almost froze with fear,</p>
<p class="pp6i">And to those trusty shoulders closely clung.<br />
Again Sordello: “Go we down and see</p>
<p class="pp6i">These mighty shades, and let them hear our tongue:<br />
Thy presence will to them right gracious be.”</p>
<p class="pp6i">Only three steps I think brought me below<br />

<p class="pp6i">As if who I might be he fain would know.<br />
‘Twas dusk, yet not so but the dusky air,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Between his eyes and mine, within the dell,<br />
Showed what before it did not quite declare.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Towards me he moved, and I towards him as well:<br />
Gentle Judge Nino, when I saw thee there</p>
<p class="pp6i">What joy was mine to find thee not in hell!<br />
We left unsaid no form of fair salute:</p>
<p class="pp6i">Then he inquired: “How long since thou didst come<br />
O’er the far waters to the mountain’s foot?”</p>
<p class="pp6i">“O but this morn,” said I, “the realms of gloom<br />
I passed: in the first life I am, but fain</p>
<p class="pp6i">Would find the next by following on this track.”<br />
Like to men suddenly amazed, the twain,</p>
<p class="pp6i">He and Sordello, hearing this, drew back.<br />
One looked at Virgil, one into the face</p>
<p class="pp6i">Of a companion sitting there, and cried,<br />
“Up, Conrad! see what God hath of his grace</p>
<p class="pp6i">Bestowed,” then turning unto me replied:</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">CONCLUDED.</p>

<h3 class="p2">III.</h3>

<p class="pc1">RUSSIAN VICTIMS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> following morning, Rasumowski
sat with his guests at a sumptuous
breakfast in his elegant summer-house,
the roof of which rested upon beautifully
ornamented pillars. Adolph
von Sempach appeared very sad; for
he had again received evidences of
Alexandra’s indomitable pride and
want of feeling. Beck remarked the
disposition of his friend, and he
thought with satisfaction of the deeply
afflicted mother in her lonely palace at
Posen.</p>

<p>“Some years ago, the emperor
emancipated the serfs&mdash;did he act
prudently?” asked the high official
of Berlin.</p>

<p>“Whatever the czar does, is well
done,” answered the governor; “and
if the future czar again introduces
the former system of servitude, that
also will be right. But you must
not understand the abolition of servitude
in a literal sense. The serfs;
were freed only from servitude to the
nobility; the Russian nobility have
lost by it. But both peasant and
noble will always remain slaves of
the emperor. Consequently servitude
still exists in Russia, the same kind
that you desire to establish in
the new German Empire. Ah! there
comes the Roman Catholic pastor!”
exclaimed the governor, his features
assuming at once their accustomed
look of ferocity. “Now, gentlemen,
see how I shall deal with this hero
of liberty, who preaches rebellion to
the people!”</p>

<p>The pastor timidly approached the
Russian dignitary, and allowed himself
to be treated in a manner unworthy
of his priestly dignity.</p>

<p>But the priest had seen many thousands
of his Catholic brethren put to
death and transported to Siberia.
He knew that, by a stroke of the pen,
Rasumowski could doom him to the
same fate; and to this must also be
added the fact that in Poland Catholic
clergyman are educated by professors
appointed by the Russian
government. These professors very
naturally train and discipline the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
seminarians according to the commands
of a government hostile to the
Roman Catholic religion. Solid theological
learning and a proper appreciation
of the dignity of the priesthood
are not sufficiently esteemed,
for which reason we must make allowances
for the cringing deportment
of the village pastor.</p>

<p>After having made a low reverence
before the governor, the latter
rudely accosted him by saying, “Have
you your sermon with you?”</p>

<p>“It is at your service, your honor,”
replied the priest, taking with trembling
hands from his pocket a written
sheet of paper, which he handed to
the governor.</p>

<p>Rasumowski began to read, while
now and then a sign of contempt or
a shade of anger would spread itself
over his face.</p>

<p>“By the heavens above me! pastor,
this is incredible; in your sermon
there is not one word said about his
most high majesty the emperor!
What is the meaning of this? Do
you wish to go to Siberia?”</p>

<p>The priest shook like an aspen-leaf.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, your honor, pardon
me!” stammered the priest. “I
preached, as your honor may condescend
to see, not about the most high
emperor, but concerning Jesus Christ,
the Saviour of the world, who has redeemed
men through his death upon
the cross, and has freed them from
the servitude of Satan.”</p>

<p>“Bah!&mdash;Saviour of the world&mdash;nonsense!”
interrupted the governor.
“You must always preach about the
most high the emperor. Your remarks
about the Saviour of the world
are altogether superfluous. And
then,” he continued, with a threatening
frown, “in your sermon you
repeatedly use words not approved
of by the government; that is, <i>freedom</i>
and <i>servitude</i>. You must never again
use such expressions, for, if you do&mdash;remember
Siberia!”</p>

<p>“Pardon, your honor! My intention
was to show the people that we
must obey God from motives of gratitude.”</p>

<p>“That, again, is nonsense!” exclaimed
the governor. “If God
wishes the people to obey him, let
him march his soldiers against the
disobedient. Our first duty is to the
emperor; this you must preach to
your parishioners!”</p>

<p>He rang the bell, which was immediately
answered by a Cossack.</p>

<p>“Bring me a sheet of official paper,
and the pen and ink!” said Rasumowski
to the servant. “Now, listen,
pastor, to what I say! If you again
preach upon <i>liberty</i> or <i>servitude</i>, you
will be sent to Siberia; for in the
holy Russian Empire there is neither
<i>freedom</i> nor <i>servitude</i>; and, in order
that you may become a practical
preacher, you must preach for a
whole year on nothing else but on
the <i>kindness</i>, <i>mildness</i>, <i>glory</i>, <i>wisdom</i>,
<i>power</i>, and <i>benevolence</i> of the emperor,
but, above all, on the strict obligation
of unconditional obedience due to
him. Will you do this?”</p>

<p>“At your honor’s command,” replied
the intimidated priest.</p>

<p>Rasumowski wrote upon a sheet
of paper which bore the printed superscription:
“Police Notice.” He
then read aloud what he had written:
“In this church the only topic
to be preached upon for a whole year
is on the high qualities of the emperor,
and on the obligations of his
subjects to him.”</p>

<p>He then folded the paper, and
gave it to the priest.</p>

<p>“That your congregation may be
informed of my command,” said he,
“you must nail this police notice
upon the church door. Now
go!”</p>

<p>Before the priest had left the garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the Berlin official burst into a
loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh! this is sublime!” he exclaimed.
“I must confess that you have
these priests under splendid subjection.
The Russian method is admirable,
and must be introduced into the
new German Empire.”</p>

<p>“My opinion,” said the professor,
in a tone of indescribable sarcasm,
“is that this Russian method is even
excelled by the Prussian. The governor
has not forbidden the pastor to
preach, he has simply given him matter
for his sermons; but upon the
doors of several churches in certain
cities of Prussia <i>police notices</i> are
placed, which forbid preaching altogether;
and not only preaching, but
even the hearing of confessions and
the celebration of Mass. I think,
therefore, that we have surpassed the
Russians.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” replied Herr Schulze;
“but the order of which you speak
is unfortunately directed only against
the Jesuits.”</p>

<p>“It is all the same,” answered
Beck. “Catholic preaching, the holy
Mass, and confession were forbidden.
The war of destruction is not made
solely against the Jesuits, but against
the church.”</p>

<p>“You are correct, professor!” answered
Schulze. “Do you know Dr.
Friedberg, of Leipzig?”</p>

<p>“Not personally,” replied Beck;
“but I am familiar with some of his
writings.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Schulze, “Dr.
Friedberg is Bismarck’s most faithful
adviser and assistant in the combat
against the ultramontanes, who are so
hostile to the empire. Friedberg has
lately published a work in which he
expressly says that war is to be made
not on the Jesuits alone, but on the
whole Catholic Church, and that this
war must be energetically carried
out.”</p>

<p>“Without reference to Dr. Friedberg’s
pamphlet,” said Beck, “it is
clearly evident to every man of judgment,
that the destruction of the
Catholic Church is the one thing
aimed at. It is really amusing to see
how opinions change. Some years
ago, the liberal press spoke of the
Catholic religion with the greatest
disrespect and contempt. The Pope
was a feeble old man, and Catholicity
tottering to its fall; it was, in
fact, not only lifeless, but even unfit
to live. To-day, however, this same
liberal press proclaims the very reverse.
The Pope is now so dangerous
that Bismarck is already using
every effort to secure at the next
election of a pope a man who has
what is popularly called <i>extended
views</i>, and who will make very little
use of the extraordinary powers of his
office. It has become evident to the
liberals that Catholicity is by no
means a worn-out, dead thing, but
that it is to be feared and is strong
enough even to overthrow the new
German Empire.”</p>

<p>“You make the newspapers of too
much consequence,” replied Schulze.
“Our journalists write under great
restrictions, of course; but they are
well paid for their work, and cost us
a great deal of money. Bismarck’s
organ, <i>The North-German General
Gazette</i>, alone costs the empire every
year over twenty thousand dollars.
Bismarck, nevertheless, has a very low
opinion of newspaper-writers; he
calls them, as is well known, <i>his swine-herds</i>.
You cannot, however, deny
the fact, professor, that the Catholic
Church is hostile to the empire.”</p>

<p>“If you ask me as an historian,
Herr Schulze, I must contradict some
of your assertions,” said Beck. “The
Catholic Church is a spiritual power,
but is not hostile to the empire, as
far as the new empire aspires after
the liberal development of noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ideas. Culture, freedom, civilization,
true humanity, are children of the
Catholic Church. As you know, Herder,
our great writer, has said: ‘Without
the Catholic Church, Europe
would have become in all probability
the prey of despots, the theatre of
perpetual discord and strife, or else a
vast desert.’ If, however, the new
German Empire intends to introduce
a Russian form of government, and
with it servitude and the knout,
then, of course, the Catholic Church
will fearlessly manifest her displeasure.”</p>

<p>The governor and Herr Schulze
opened their eyes, and gazed with
astonishment and suspicion upon the
daring speaker.</p>

<p>“Do not forget,” remarked Von
Sempach, “that my friend speaks
only from a historical standpoint.”</p>

<p>“On the whole you are right, Herr
Beck!” exclaimed the governor.
“The Catholic Church confuses the
minds of the people by preaching
about <i>liberty</i>, <i>about being the children
of God</i>, about <i>the dignity of man</i>, and
all such absurdities. The Pope and
his priests make their people proud,
obstinate, and rebellious, and difficult
to manage. Mark my prediction,
Herr Schulze: you cannot introduce
the Russian form of government into
Germany until Catholicity is exterminated.”</p>

<p>“We will rid ourselves of it,” said
Schulze confidently. “The Jesuits
are already expelled, and now we are
using stringent measures to suppress
their kith and kin&mdash;that is, all the
orders and convents&mdash;so that we
shall gradually have the Catholic
Church under the same subjection as
it is in Russia. And have you noticed,
gentlemen, how quietly all has
been effected? The Jesuits were sent
away without the least opposition on
the part of the Catholics; the riot at
Essen was only the demonstration of
a few workmen.”</p>

<p>“There was, however, great excitement
among the liberals,” replied
Von Sempach; “for, when the German
religious were innocently proscribed
and forcibly driven from their
homes, the national liberals applauded
and cried out ‘Bravo!’”</p>

<p>“If you imagine, Herr Schulze,”
said Beck, “that the patient endurance
of Catholics in witnessing the
expulsion of their priests is not dangerous,
you deceive yourself. Their
manner of combat, however, is a very
singular one. Recourse to arms, or
rebellion against authority, is forbidden
them by their religion; but history
teaches that the weapons employed
by the Catholic Church have
proved most disastrous to all her
enemies. And it is to me as clear as
the sun at noon-day that, in consequence
of this persecution of the
church, the German Empire will
succumb.”</p>

<p>“You speak in riddles, Herr
Beck!” said Schulze. “What do
you mean when you speak of the
Catholic manner of combat?”</p>

<p>“That which is, in fact, the very
essence of Catholicity,” answered
the professor. “Catholics believe
that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is
the founder of their church; they
know that God will never abandon
his church, because he has promised
to abide always with her. Since
they are forbidden to conspire and
rebel, they have recourse to prayer,
and they pray to Almighty God to
keep his word&mdash;in my opinion, a very
dangerous mode of combat; for no
power, not even that of the new German
Empire, can stand against the
Lord. And it is a remarkable truth that
the Catholics, for over 1,800 years,
have conquered all their oppressors.
If Bismarck should commence to
boil and roast Catholics, as did Nero
and other cruel tyrants who persecuted
them for three hundred years, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
would meet with the same fate that
befell the pagan emperors of Rome.”</p>

<p>“What you say, professor, is no
doubt incontrovertible, for the facts
are historical,” replied Schulze. “We
do not, however, intend, for the
present, to either boil or roast Catholics,
and it is not even necessary
to adopt such severe measures. If
the liberal government once gets undisputed
control of all the academies
and public schools, Catholicity must
naturally die out.”</p>

<p>“Another deception, Herr Schulze,”
replied Beck. “The apostate Emperor
Julian, fifteen hundred years
ago, adopted this very plan of exterminating
Catholics. He established
infidel instead of Christian schools;
but the Emperor Julian perished, together
with his empire, while the Catholic
Church still exists, and is the
terror of her enemies.”</p>

<p>“We have heard enough!” exclaimed
the governor. “We will not
deny the assertion of our learned
friend. The Catholics in the new
German Empire can suffer and pray,
and look for assistance from above,
until they say their dying prayer, as
they do in Poland.”</p>

<p>From the eyes of the professor
there shone a brilliant ray of light.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Governor Rasumowski,”
said he; “not Catholic
Poland, but the Russian Empire, is
saying its dying prayer.”</p>

<p>If lightning had come down from
heaven, it would not have made a
greater impression upon the Russian
when he heard Beck’s remark.</p>

<p>“You seem astonished, governor,”
said the professor. “Are you really
ignorant of what a volcano the Russian
Empire is standing upon? I
have made diligent inquiries upon
the subject, and know something of
the interior dissensions that prevail
in Russia. The present emperor is
also aware of it; for his father, when
dying, admonished him, saying:
‘Soucha (that is, Alexander), take
care, lest thou become the Louis XVI.
of Russia!’ Excuse my candor, and
permit me to wish you good-morning,
as I intend to accompany my
friend to the city.”</p>

<p>The two young men walked
through the garden, followed by the
angry looks of the Prussian and the
Russian.</p>

<p>Severe weather prevailed for some
days. Excursions into the country
were out of the question. Schulze
visited the public institutions of the
city, which were managed according
to the Russian system.</p>

<p>One day, Von Sempach found the
professor busily writing in his room.</p>

<p>“Are you taking notes, Edward?”</p>

<p>“I am collecting important Russian
items to send to Bolanden, that
he may use them for the good of the
German people, and for the benefit
of other nations, who do not desire to
be governed according to the Russian
mode.”</p>

<p>“I protest against it,” replied Von
Sempach. “I have no desire to
figure in a novel.”</p>

<p>“Do not excite yourself, my dear
Adolph! Bolanden will change our
names, and perhaps call the gentleman
from Berlin <i>Schulze</i>. How is
Alexandra?”</p>

<p>The young man sighed heavily,
and seemed greatly distressed.</p>

<p>“I wish that I had never known
her!” said he; “for I can tell you,
in confidence, that a deformed soul
dwells in her beautiful body. Her
pride is insufferable, her want of feeling
repulsive; in fact, she is utterly
devoid of those amiable qualities
of heart and mind which a woman
must possess in order to make a
happy home.”</p>

<p>“She is the child of a Russian
governor, who, by means of the pleti
and Siberia, keeps in subjection the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
serfs of the divine emperor,” replied
Beck. “I told Schulze and the governor
my real opinion in regard to
the decayed condition of the empire
of the czar, and yet I was very temperate
in my language; I should have
added that Almighty God also is the
arbiter of nations, and suffers the
continuance of Russian barbarities
only to show how deeply empires
can sink, and how wicked men can
become, when an emperor has unlimited
command in church and
state. The same result will take
place in Germany, if she takes Russia
as her model.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will not use such expressions
before Rasumowski,” said
Adolph warningly.</p>

<p>“No; we must not cast the pearls
of truth before swine, for they would
perhaps attack us with their Cossacks
and the pleti!”</p>

<p>“Why do you jest?” said Adolph.
“The discoveries I have made concerning
Alexandra’s real nature have
made me very sad. Why must I bind
myself for ever to such a creature?”</p>

<p>“Reason and the desire for true
happiness forbid it!” answered the
professor. “You are free, and not a
Russian serf. Act like a man; destroy
the magic charm which her
fatal beauty has woven around you.
My travelling-bag is ready, let us go
back to your dear mother Olga. I
am disgusted with everything in this
corrupt, stupid Russian Empire.”</p>

<p>The servant of Von Sempach now
announced dinner. As the two
friends entered the dining-room,
Schulze, with an air of triumph, held
out a newspaper.</p>

<p>“Herr Beck, you cannot say now
that the Germans are unwilling to
adopt the Russian form of government,”
he exclaimed. “Here, read
<i>The Cross Gazette</i>. You remember
what trouble we had with reference
to the village of huts which some miserable
and poverty-stricken wretches
had built outside the gates of Berlin.
Well, these huts have been all removed,
according to the Russian
method.”</p>

<p>“So I understand!” said the professor,
who had read the article.
“<i>The Cross Gazette</i> announces that
the President of Police, Herr von
Madai, had given orders to several
hundred policemen and soldiers to
take down, in the night from Monday
to Tuesday, the collection of huts
outside of the Landsberg-gate; the
poor settlers, who were roused from
their sleep, were driven away without
difficulty, although the men murmured,
and the women and children
wept; but there was otherwise no
disturbance or resistance. What a
fine contribution to the history of the
new German Empire!” added Beck.</p>

<p>“Is it not also stated,” asked
Adolph, whose face was glowing
with indignation, “that the humanity
on which they pride themselves held
the torch while the sorrowing women
and children were driven from
their wretched homes into the cold,
dark night?”</p>

<p>“Why, Von Sempach, do not be
so sentimental!” exclaimed the governor.
“Be like a Russian, who
wastes very little time or sympathy
on such occasions.”</p>

<p>Dinner was served. Alexandra
had never appeared more lovely;
her toilet was exquisite. She had
remarked the serious deportment of
her betrothed; for she made use of
every species of blandishment in
order to regain possession of his
heart.</p>

<p>But something happened which
brought matters to a crisis.</p>

<p>The dessert had just been laid,
when a servant of the governor
handed him an official paper. He
had only read a few lines, when a
grim smile diffused itself over his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have a surprise for you, gentlemen!”
said he. “The nearest
Prussian police-station has had the
kindness to deliver up to me the
Jesuit F. Indura, so that I may forward
him to his native place, Kosow.”</p>

<p>“A Jesuit? Oh! that’s imperial!”
exclaimed Alexandra, filled with
curiosity. “I have heard so much
of the Jesuits, and wish to see one.
Papa, will you not have him brought
here?”</p>

<p>“If it gives you pleasure, why
not? That is, if our honored guests
have no objection.”</p>

<p>“None at all, governor!” replied
Adolph von Sempach, with stern
formality. “You alone have to decide.”</p>

<p>“And I think that it is always
praiseworthy to be willing to see and
hear a Jesuit,” said Beck.</p>

<p>“Tell the commissioner of police,”
commanded Rasumowski, “to bring
before me without delay the Jesuit
of Kosow!”</p>

<p>“Oh! that will be interesting!”
exclaimed Alexandra. “I am so
anxious to see a man who belongs to
that terrible order which has sold
itself to the devil, and labors only in
the interest of hell.”</p>

<p>“Do you really believe what you
say, mademoiselle?” asked Von Sempach,
in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Certainly! I have often read in
the newspapers shocking things about
the Jesuits. They are said to possess
in an extraordinary degree the
power of deceiving people, and they
owe this spiritual power to Satan,
with whom they are in league.”</p>

<p>“You have derived your information
from the Vienna <i>New Free Press</i>,
is it not so?”</p>

<p>“It may be, I do not know exactly.
The new German Empire, in its
fear of God and love of morality,
acts very prudently in expelling these
diabolical Jesuits.”</p>

<p>“But suppose these diabolical
Jesuits come to Russia?”</p>

<p>“Oh! we are not afraid of them;
we will send them to Siberia!”</p>

<p>“Here comes the Jesuit,” said
Rasumowski, when he heard the
clattering sound made by the guards’
sabres.</p>

<p>Deep silence reigned in the dining-room.
All sat with their eyes intently
fixed upon the door. In the hall
were heard heavy, weary steps, as
though an aged or sick man was
moving forward with great difficulty.
Then a hand appeared, grasping the
side of the door, and finally the
Jesuit father, a tall, thin man, very
much bent, and leaning on a cane.</p>

<p>“Come in, quick!” cried out Rasumowski
roughly.</p>

<p>F. Indura staggered into the room.
The door was closed after him.</p>

<p>Those who were present gazed in
silence at the suffering priest, who
could hardly stand on his feet, and
who leaned exhausted against the
wall. Although still young, the incredible
hardships that he had undergone
of fatigue as well as of hunger
and thirst seemed to have entirely
destroyed the bodily strength of the
Jesuit. His face was deathly pale,
and the hand which held his wide-brimmed
hat trembled from excessive
weakness. His black habit was
covered with dust, as if he had been
driven like a prisoner on the highway.
Upon his breast there hung
an honorable sign of distinction, bestowed
by the new German Empire&mdash;the
iron cross. After having saluted
those present, this victim of modern
humanity and liberal justice silently
awaited the command of the Russian
governor.</p>

<p>“Your name is Indura, and you
come from Kosow?” commenced the
governor.</p>

<p>“Yes, your honor!” answered the
priest, in a feeble voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have been expelled by the
Prussian government, and in the holy
Russian Empire you can find an
abiding-place, and perhaps secure
for yourself a splendid position, if you
will renounce the Society of Jesus,
and embrace the Russian state religion.
Are you determined to do
this?” asked the governor.</p>

<p>“No, your honor! I prefer death
to apostasy!”</p>

<p>“Well, we will not hang you yet
awhile!” brutally exclaimed the governor.
“But we can send you to the
mines of Siberia.”</p>

<p>“That will be impossible, sir!”
replied the Jesuit, with a faint smile.
“for my strength is too far gone
ever to reach Siberia.”</p>

<p>Von Sempach had until now been
a quiet spectator of the scene; alternate
feelings of compassion and
indignation filled his breast whenever
he looked at the priest. He turned
to Alexandra, in whose impassive
features not a vestige of sympathy
was visible.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” said he in a subdued
voice, “a work of mercy is
necessary in this case. This poor
clergyman is dying from exhaustion.
Will you have any objection if I
offer him my seat?”</p>

<p>The Russian lady turned fiercely
around, like a serpent that had been
trodden upon.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?” she
answered, with a proud disdain.
“Do you think that I will grant such
a disgraceful request?”</p>

<p>An angry flush overspread the face
of the young man; his eyes gleamed
with a new light, and a proud, contemptuous
smile wreathed his lips.
Alexandra at this moment had for
ever forfeited the love of a heart of
which she was unworthy.</p>

<p>The governor meantime continued
his questions.</p>

<p>“As you still wish to remain a
Jesuit,” said he, “that is, a man
dangerous to the empire, an enemy
of modern civilization, you will be
sent to Siberia!”</p>

<p>“Will your honor not procure me
a passport to India?”</p>

<p>“What do you want to do in
India?”</p>

<p>“We have missions there,” replied
the priest. “As it is my vocation to
work for the salvation of souls, I
wish to preach there the doctrine of
Christ according to my humble capacity.”</p>

<p>“I must reflect upon your petition,”
replied the governor. “The
government may not wish the Jesuits
to continue their activity even in
India. For the present, you must go
to prison!”</p>

<p>The priest made a motion to leave,
but his strength failed him, and a
cold sweat appeared in large drops
upon his forehead. Then Adolph
von Sempach rose.</p>

<p>“Governor Rasumowski,” said he,
“I do not believe that I shall appeal
in vain to your feelings as a man. I
therefore urgently beseech you to
allow me to offer some refreshment
to this exhausted gentleman from
your hospitable table.”</p>

<p>Von Sempach spoke in such an
earnest tone of voice that it seemed
impossible to refuse him.</p>

<p>“If you wish to assume the character
of the good Samaritan, Von
Sempach, I do not object,” answered
the Russian, making a great effort to
conceal his real displeasure.</p>

<p>Adolph approached the weak and
feeble priest, and, giving him the support
of his arm, led him to his seat.</p>

<p>“Allow me, reverend sir, to serve
you.”</p>

<p>The Jesuit looked at him with
gratitude, and Adolph commenced
to fill his plate. The half-starved
owner of the iron cross began to eat,
and like a lamp whose dying flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
is revived when oil is poured upon
it, so also was it with the proscribed
priest, who soon felt the benefit of
Adolph’s tender care.</p>

<p>Alexandra had left the room when
she saw that her father would grant
the request of Von Sempach. With
an expression of unutterable scorn
and disgust, she gathered up the train
of her rich silk dress, and retired to
her own apartment.</p>

<p>“Will the new German Empire
send us any more of such guests?”
asked the governor, who was filled
with suppressed wrath at seeing a
Jesuit at his table.</p>

<p>“Hardly!” replied Schulze. “The
majority of the Jesuits are Germans
or Swiss; there are only a few Poles
among them.”</p>

<p>“Are only the foreigners expelled,
and not the Germans?” asked the
Russian.</p>

<p>“No Jesuit, even if he be a German,
can remain in the new German
Empire, and discharge any sacerdotal
or educational functions,” replied
Schulze.</p>

<p>“It has made a very strange impression
upon me,” said the professor,
“to see men condemned and
treated like criminals, against whom
not the least fault can be proved.
Even the bitterest enemies of the
Jesuits confessed this at the Diet,
saying, ‘We find no fault in them!’
An old proverb asserts that ‘Justice
is the foundation of kingdoms.’ The
conduct of Russia against Poland excepted,
there is not a similar example
in modern history.”</p>

<p>“Is your remark intended as a reproach,
Professor Beck?” asked the
Russian.</p>

<p>“I refer only to historical facts,”
replied the professor. “My personal
opinion has nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“And I must openly acknowledge
to you my belief that Germany acts
very prudently in imitating the Russian
method in treating defiant Catholics!”
retorted the governor.</p>

<p>“Then, we shall have violence
done to conscience, and the destruction
of human liberty in the highest
sense of the word,” said the professor.
“From this tyranny of conscience
would result, as a natural consequence,
a state of slavery and a demoralized
condition of affairs. Religion
would cease to ennoble man,
because her enemies would misrepresent
her doctrines in such a way that
she would cease to be the revelation
of God; she would become a machine
of the state, and this machine
would be called a National Church&mdash;a
hideous thing that would prove to
be the grave of all liberty. Finally,
an abyss would open, and swallow up
the whole; for Almighty God will
not suffer the wickedness of man to
go beyond a certain length. History
records his punishments; as, for example,
the Deluge, the destruction of
the kingdoms belonging to the Babylonians
and Persians, the destruction
of Jerusalem and of the Jewish nation.”</p>

<p>Rasumowski was about to answer,
when the Jesuit father rose from his
chair.</p>

<p>“Sir!” said he to Adolph von Sempach,
“you have, in truth, performed
a work of mercy. May the Lord in
heaven reward you!”</p>

<p>“He has already done so, your
reverence!” replied Von Sempach,
with a look at Alexandra’s vacant
seat.</p>

<p>“Accept my grateful thanks, your
honor!” said Indura to the Russian.</p>

<p>“That will do!” interrupted the
governor. “The commissioner is
waiting for you.”</p>

<p>Adolph left the room with the
priest.</p>

<p>“All learned gentlemen do not
seem to approve of the war of extermination
against the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Church,” said Schulze, in a slightly
ironical tone.</p>

<p>“At least, not those who have preserved
some sense of justice,” replied
Beck. “I cannot understand how so
many millions of Catholics can submit
to be insulted and threatened in
a way that should excite the indignation
of Christendom.”</p>

<p>“It is all very clear,” explained
Schulze. “A national church is to be
established in Germany, just as it is
in Russia. Protestantism sees the
necessity of the change, and makes
no resistance; but it is not so with
Catholicity.”</p>

<p>“I agree to the last assertion, Herr
Schulze,” said Beck. “From the
very earliest ages there have been
cowardly bishops and cowardly
priests; but the Catholic Church has
never made concessions in matters
of faith, and will never do so in all
time to come.”</p>

<p>“For this very reason she must be
exterminated, even if we have to resort
to extreme measures,” answered
the great official of Berlin, in a transport
of passion.</p>

<p>“And do you believe in the possibility
of extermination?” asked
Beck.</p>

<p>“Why not? The educated portion
of the world has long since repudiated
all belief in the nursery
tales of religion.”</p>

<p>“I most solemnly protest against
your remarks,” said the professor.
“Religion is as much a nursery tale
as is the existence of God, who manifests
himself in his works; the most
wonderful work of whose hands is
the Catholic Church, particularly her
miraculous preservation. While everything
else in the course of time falls
into decay; while the proudest nations
disappear from the face of the
earth, leaving scarce a trace behind
them; while sceptres are constantly
passing from the hands of rulers, the
chair of Peter stands immovable.
No intelligent man can refuse to respect
and admire the Catholic religion.
On the other hand, I do not
deny that liberalism in its spiritually
rotten condition, devoid as it is of
every high aspiration, is ripe for the
establishment of a national church,
which is to be fashioned after the
Russian model. The new German
Emperor-pope will be able, without
opposition from the liberals, to introduce
the Russian catechism. Liberalism
will not object to the introduction
of the pleti and to a Siberia; for
it is servile, without principle, and utterly
demoralized. Those Germans,
however, who have preserved their
holy faith, their dignity as men, and
their self-respect, are no slaves, and
will never wear the yoke of Russian
servitude.”</p>

<p>“Sir, you insult me!” vociferated
the Russian governor.</p>

<p>“In what manner do I insult
you?” said Beck. “You yourself
maintained a few days ago that the
Russians were all serfs of the czar.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are; but I will not allow
you to speak of it with such contempt,”
responded the irritated dignitary.</p>

<p>“Since we are not as yet serfs in
the new German Empire,” said the
professor earnestly, “you will permit
a free man to express his views.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not allow you to do
so!” cried Rasumowski, with a loud
voice. “If you were not, unfortunately,
the friend of my future son-in-law,
I would send you to Siberia as a
man dangerous to the empire.”</p>

<p>The professor rose.</p>

<p>“Governor!” he exclaimed, in a
tone of unmistakable self-restraint,
“your rudeness makes it impossible
for me to stay one moment longer
under your roof. The very thought
of having received your hospitality
is painful to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment, Adolph von Sempach
appeared.</p>

<p>“Governor Rasumowski,” said he,
“I have come to say farewell. Your
daughter, whom I have seen, will
communicate to you the reasons of
my departure.”</p>

<p>The Russian, with widely distended
eyes, looked with astonishment at the
young nobleman, who bowed and disappeared
with his friend the professor.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the palace, the
servant of Von Sempach held open
the door of a carriage. The friends
entered, and drove to the depot.</p>

<p>“But, Adolph, how do you feel?
Tell me what has happened!” asked
Beck.</p>

<p>“That which had to be done, unless
I chose to make myself unhappy
for my whole life,” replied Von Sempach.
“I have broken my engagement
with Alexandra.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you from my
whole heart!” said Beck, warmly
pressing the hand of his friend.</p>

<p>The next morning, the Baroness
Olga welcomed the returned travellers;
and when Adolph related what
had happened, joy and happiness illuminated
the face of the good mother,
who embraced and kissed her
son. The professor stood smiling at
her side.</p>

<p>“You see, most gracious lady,”
said he, “that the study of Russian
affairs is very apt to convince every
good German of the impossibility
of obtaining real happiness and
prosperity from the land of the
knout.”</p>

<p>A few days later the poor people
exclaimed: “Our mother Olga is
well again; her eyes have lost their
sad expression, and the kind smile
has returned to her lips.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c171" name="c171">MY COUSIN’S INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> only fault we could possibly
find with the Gastons was that they
were Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>True, they were our own cousins,
quite as well off as ourselves, and as
well educated and respectable as any
family in the country; but then,
being Romanists, you know, they associated
with such queer people, had
such singular notions, and attended
a church filled every Sunday with
families that you and I would never
think of speaking to, you know.</p>

<p>Aunt Mildred went to Mass with
them one Sabbath, just out of curiosity,
and declared there wasn’t a
decent bonnet in the whole congregation
outside of Cousin Mary’s pew;
and father, who looked in at the
chapel on Christmas Day, told us he
didn’t see a single carriage at the entrance&mdash;nothing
but a lot of farmers’
and workingmen’s wagons.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Gastons were
charming people. Our affection for
them went to the full extent of our
cousinly relationship, and I in particular&mdash;by
the way, I forgot to introduce
myself&mdash;George Willoughby,
at your service, just twenty-one&mdash;nice
age, isn’t it? Graduated at&mdash;but I
won’t mention what college in New
England, lest you might expect too
much of me. Well, as I was saying&mdash;and
I in particular had conceived
quite an attachment for my Cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Richard Gaston. He was three
years my senior, had received his
education in some out-of-the-way
Catholic college situated on the top
or at the foot&mdash;I really forget which&mdash;of
some mountain among the Alleghenies.
We had frequently met
and exchanged visits during our vacations,
and the only objection I had
to Cousin Dick was that on these
occasions he made no end of fun of
my Protestant Latin pronunciation,
asking me to read a page of Virgil,
and then rolling over in his chair,
splitting his sides with laughter.
What he found so comical in my
recitation I could not imagine. I
saw nothing in it to laugh at. This
was several years ago. I now know
the cause of his mirth.</p>

<p>But even if Dick did make fun of
my Latin, and call it barbarous, he
was a good fellow, although I must
say that at times he presumed a little
upon his seniority so as to be a trifle
mentorish. Indeed, I loved him as a
friend, independently of my affection
for him as a relative. He was considerate,
too, and never troubled me
with any of his Romanish notions,
except when I sometimes asked him
a question about the church, or
touching some point in Catholic history,
and then I generally received
more information than I either expected
or desired. One of these occasions
I well remember, for the conversation
eventually led to serious results for
me. I had gone down to spend a
week with the Gastons. One rainy
afternoon&mdash;too wet to drive over to
the village, as we had intended&mdash;I
had just waded through the strange,
eventful story of that gay and festive
American citizen, Mr. St. Elmo, and,
as usual when at a loss for something
to do, I began to look around for Dick.</p>

<p>I soon found him in the library,
but so entirely engrossed with a book
that he did not notice my entrance.</p>

<p>“What are you reading?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said he, “nothing that
would interest you.”</p>

<p>“Let me see?” I took the book,
and read the title-page: <i>Introduction
to a Devout Life. From the French
of S. Francis of Sales.</i> “Why, Dick,”
said I, “this is Thursday, not Sunday.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said I, “on Sunday you
get out the Bible, or some pious
book, and read a spell&mdash;needn’t read
very long, you know, about enough
to keep your face straight for the
rest of the day. It’s the thing to do&mdash;good
young man, and all that sort of
thing, you know&mdash;<i>Cela vous pose</i>, as
the French say; but as to pious reading,
except for that or to fight a rainy
Sabbath with&mdash;never heard of such a
thing. But what’s your book about?
Who is your Sales man? Some old
‘stick-in-the-mud’ of a stupid hermit,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Your phrase is not of the politest,”
replied Dick, “but I will answer
your question. S. Francis of
Sales was not what you describe, but
an elegant, accomplished gentleman,
a graduate of the Sorbonne at Paris,
and of the University of Padua,
where, after a brilliant examination,
he took the degree of doctor of laws
with great distinction.”</p>

<p>“That might all be,” I answered,
for I was determined not to accept
Dick’s saint without a fight, as was
indeed my duty, being a staunch
Protestant&mdash;a <i>rôle</i> no one need ever
have any trouble in filling, for, as I
understand it, you have nothing to do
but deny everything the Romanists
assert&mdash;“that might all be. I suppose
he took refuge in orders and
sanctimony because he had a game-leg,
like your Loyola man there&mdash;what
do you call him? yes, S. Ignatius&mdash;brave
fellow, by the way, and
a good soldier&mdash;or else he was jilted
by some handsome girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind. His early
years, his youth, his student life, and
his advent in the world were all
marked by a modesty, a purity, and
a piety that seemed to be the sure
precursor of a saintly life.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said I, “I have it now.
He must have been a hard-featured
fellow, so ugly, most probably, that,
piety being his only resource, he became
a regular old square-toes of a
monk in advance of the mail.”</p>

<p>My cousin took a new book off the
table, and said, “How ugly he was
you shall hear from his Protestant
biographer.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Listen:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘A commanding stature, a peculiar
though unstudied dignity of manner, he
habitually moved somewhat slowly, as
though to check the natural impetuosity
of a vigorous, healthy frame; regular
though marked features, to which a singularly
sweet smile, large blue eyes, and
pencilled eyebrows gave great beauty; a
complexion of almost feminine delicacy,
in spite of ceaseless exposure to all weathers.
His voice was deep and rich in tone;
and, according to one who knew him, he
was in appearance at once so bright and
serious that it was impossible to conceive
a more imposing presence.’”</p>

<p class="p1">“That’s all very well,” I answered,
determined not to give it up yet;
“but that work of his you were reading,
that <i>Devout life</i>, is nothing but a
string of prayers anyhow, isn’t it?&mdash;a
sort of a down-on-your-marrowbones
manual?”</p>

<p>“Quite the reverse, my dear
George. When the book was first
published, it was seized upon with
avidity, and became immensely popular,
precisely because its author, not
content with prescribing rules for exterior
acts of devotion, sought also to
lead souls into the interior life of piety.
But judge for yourself. Let me read
now a short extract from the very first
chapter, and you will at once see that,
in the opinion of S. Francis of Sales,
the mere down-on-your-marrowbones
performance, as you not very elegantly
phrase it, will not, of itself, take
you to heaven.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “Dick, this is getting
to be rather more than I bargained
for; but I’ll fight it out on this
line if it takes me till tea-time. So
go on.” And he read:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“As Aurelius painted all the faces of
his pictures in the air and resemblance
of the woman he loved, so every one
paints devotion according to his own passion
and fancy. He that is addicted to
fasting, thinks himself very devout if he
fasts, though his heart be at the same
time filled with rancor; and, scrupling to
moisten his tongue with wine, or even
with water, through sobriety, he hesitates
not to drink deep of his neighbor’s blood
by detraction and calumny. <i>Another
considers himself devout because he recites
daily a multiplicity of prayers</i>, though immediately
afterwards he utters disagreeable,
arrogant, and injurious words
amongst his domestics and neighbors.
Another cheerfully draws alms out of his
purse to relieve the poor, but cannot
draw meekness out of his heart to forgive
his enemies. Another readily forgives
enemies, but never satisfies his creditors
but by constraint. These by some are
esteemed devout, while, in reality, they
are by no means so.”</p>

<p class="p1">“That’s pretty plain talk,” was my
comment&mdash;“a good deal plainer than
they give it to us down at our meeting-house.
It sets a fellow to thinking,
too.” And here I was about to
make a damaging admission, when I
fortunately recollected that I was in
line of battle, with my enemy in
front. So I charged again with:
“Oh! it’s easy enough to write or
preach the most pious precepts, and,
at the same time, not be at all remarkable
for their practice. If your
Sales man was such a fine gentleman
as you describe, I strongly suspect
that that very fact kept him pretty
closely tied to the world, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
may have been, after all, a mere ornamental
guide-post to point out to
others the road he had no idea of
travelling himself.”</p>

<p>“George, you are incorrigible, and
I doubt that you really believe the
half of what you are saying. But I
shall not ask you to accept my opinion
of S. Francis of Sales’ personal
piety. Here is a Protestant estimate
of it: ‘There is a beauty, a symmetry,
an exquisite grace of holiness,
in all that concerns the venerable
Bishop of Geneva which fascinates
the imagination and fills the heart.
Beauty, harmony, refinement, simplicity,
utter unself-consciousness, love
of God and man, welling up and
bursting forth as a clear fountain that
never can be stayed or staunched&mdash;such
are the images and thoughts
that fill the mind as we dwell upon
his memory.’</p>

<p>“It was in 1592,” continued my
cousin, “that Francis of Sales returned
to the paternal mansion, after having
been for twelve years a scholar at
the universities, and a student of the
great world. His father had ambitious
projects for the advancement
of his only son. By agreement of
the parents on both sides, he was to
marry a rich heiress, the daughter of
the Seigneur de Vegy; and the
reigning Duke of Savoy tendered
him the high position of senator; yet,
notwithstanding the most energetic
remonstrances and prayers of his
father and many friends, he calmly
but resolutely declined both the marriage
and the senatorial dignity, and
in 1593 was received in minor orders
by the Bishop of Geneva, and ordained
priest in December of the same
year.”</p>

<p>“After which,” I interposed, “he,
of course, had an easy time of it.”</p>

<p>“Listen, and you shall hear. The
duchy of Chablais, adjoining the
Genevese territory, had in previous
years been conquered and occupied
by the Bernese, and, as one of the
results, Calvinism became predominant.
Restored to the Duke of
Savoy in 1593 as the result of treaties,
it was important to provide for
the spiritual wants of the few scattered
Catholics who remained. A
learned and pious priest named
Bouchut was sent to one of the
towns of the Chablais, but was compelled
to leave it, on account of the
fierce and hostile attitude of the inhabitants.
It was soon understood
that any Catholic priest who undertook
to minister there publicly would
do so at his peril. There was an
absolute necessity that some one
should go, but the Bishop of Geneva
naturally hesitated to order any of
his priests to so dangerous a mission.
He would gladly have sent Francis of
Sales, for he saw that he possessed
all the qualities desirable in so critical
an emergency&mdash;bravery, firmness,
prudence, and gentleness, besides a
name and family position which commanded
respect throughout the
country. Sorely embarrassed, the
good bishop convened a chapter,
and all his ecclesiastics were summoned
to be present. He laid the
matter before them, together with the
letters of the reigning duke, spoke
plainly of the difficulties and perils of
the mission, and asked their counsel
as to what should be done. As in
the case of an overwhelming peril at
sea, or a desperate charge on a fortified
place, where the captain or commander
hesitates to order men to
certain death, and calls for volunteers,
so the good bishop in this
manner really asked, ‘Who will undertake
this dangerous duty?’</p>

<p>“As the head of the chapter, it
was for Francis of Sales to speak
first. No one present knew as well
as he the most serious dangers of
the proposed mission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Amid profound and discouraging
silence, he arose, and said, ‘Monseigneur,
if you hold me capable of the
work, and bid me undertake it, I am
ready’&mdash;few words, but to the point.
Information of what had taken place
soon reached Château de Sales, and
in spite of his seventy-two years, the
father instantly ordered his horse, and
rode to Annecy, where he imploringly
remonstrated with his son, and begged
him to withdraw his offer.</p>

<p>“From the son the old man went to
the bishop, and protested in tears
against the step about to be taken.
‘I give up,’ he exclaimed, ‘my firs-tborn,
the pride and hope of my life,
the stay of my old age, to the
church; I consent to his being a
confessor; but I cannot give him to
be a martyr.’ The father’s remonstrance
was so powerful, his grief so
violent, that the good bishop was
deeply moved, and gave signs of
wavering, when Francis, perceiving
it, cried out: ‘Monseigneur, be firm,
I implore you; would you have me
prove myself unworthy of the kingdom
of God? I have put my hand
to the plough; would you have me
look back, and yield to worldly considerations?’</p>

<p>“But the father held out as well
as the son. ‘As to this undertaking,’
he said to Francis, in parting, ‘nothing
can ever make me either sanction
or bless it.’ At the last moment, several
priests offered the brave volunteer
to accompany him, but he would take
no one but his cousin, the Canon
Louis de Sales. It would be a long
but most interesting history to go
into the details of the Chablais mission.
Under other circumstances,
the people of that province might
have run the risk of being dragooned
into Catholicity as they had been
into Protestantism. But the mild
counsels of its noble apostle prevailed.
After trials, labors, and dangers
most formidable, his holy life and
winning words of peace and reconciliation
shamed persecution, transformed
hatred into respect and admiration,
and the conversion of the Chablais
was the result of his holy daring. It
was during this period that he even
penetrated into the camp of the
enemy, going to Geneva several
times to visit Calvin’s successor,
Theodore Beza, then seventy-eight
years of age.</p>

<p>“The Apostle of the Chablais, as
Francis de Sales was henceforth
called by the reigning duke, was now
urged by the aged Bishop of Geneva
to become his coadjutor, and with
great difficulty was almost forced to
accept the position. He was soon
after sent to Rome, to ask the good
offices of the sovereign pontiff in arranging
a serious dispute between
Savoy and France, as to whether
Geneva was included in the provisions
of the treaty of Vervins. Having
transacted the business of his
mission, he was notified by Clement
VIII. to prepare for a public examination
in his presence within a few
days. It is related, as characteristic
of his strong sense of justice and independence,
that, with all his reverence
for pontifical authority, and his
well-known personal humility, the
first impulse of Francis was to resist
this order as an infringement upon
his ecclesiastical rights. He laid the
matter before the ambassador of
Savoy, who immediately sought an
audience of his holiness. Clement
VIII. at once recognized the validity
of the objection, and promised that
the case should not be treated as a
precedent. He had heard so much,
he said, of the ability and talent
of De Sales, that he was desirous
of an opportunity of judging of it
himself, as was also the College of
Cardinals. The order, it was then
agreed, should stand, and the examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
go on. The only preparation
of Francis for this formidable trial
was&mdash;prayer. Indeed, there was no
time for any other, for there were but
three days between the order and the
ordeal.</p>

<p>“Among the cardinals before whom
he appeared were Baronius, Federigo
Borromeo, Borghese, and,
among their assistants, the great Bellarmine.
Added to these was a
crowd of archbishops, bishops, generals
of religious orders, and many
eminent ecclesiastics of lesser dignity.
A Spanish priest of distinguished
learning, who was to have presented
himself with Francis for examination
before this body, was so overpowered
on entering the hall that he fainted.
The scope of the examination included
civil law, canon law, and theology,
but it was confined to the last-named
branch. Thirty-five questions were
proposed, and every possible objection
was raised by the examiners to
all the answers. The examination
over, his holiness expressed his supreme
satisfaction, went to Francis,
and embraced him in presence of the
assembly, repeating the verse: ‘Bibe,
fili mi, aquam de cisterna tua, et fluenta
putei tui; deriventur fontes tui
foras, et in plateis aquas tuas divide.’<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>“In January, 1602, Francis was
sent to Paris, charged with the arrangement
of certain ecclesiastical
difficulties which had arisen in consequence
of the late transfer of the
small territory of Gex from Savoy to
France. Negotiations with royal
ministers are proverbially slow, and a
matter that Francis supposed might
be terminated in six days retained
him at Paris six months. But for
him this was not lost time. He gave
the course of Lenten sermons at the
Royal Chapel, preached constantly
in various churches and communities,
and was so tireless in his spiritual
labors that during these six
months he is said to have delivered
one hundred sermons. It was during
this visit that he suggested to
Pierre de Berulle (afterwards cardinal)
the foundation in France of
an order for the education of the
clergy, on the model of the Oratory
established in Italy by S. Philip Neri.
The project was carried out, and in
1611, when the Oratory was established
in France, its founder asked
Francis of Sales to be its first superior.</p>

<p>“The reigning King of France
was then Henry IV. He so highly
prized and admired De Sales that he
offered him every inducement to remain
in France. He recognized in
Francis the possession of all the
qualities and virtues belonging to the
model ecclesiastic, and best calculated
to make religion respected and
loved in a community scarcely recovered
from the evil effects of religious
wars. The learned Cardinal
du Perron also appeared to be of
the same opinion, for he said: ‘God
has certainly given him (De Sales)
the key of hearts. If you want merely
to convince men, bring me all the
heretics, and I will undertake to do
it; but if you want to convert them,
take them to Mgr. de Genève.’”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>“Richard, cousin of mine,” said
I, “your measure is Scriptural, heaped
up and running over. I ask you
a question about that little book
there on the table, and you give me
the entire biography of your Saint of
Sales. It’s all very edifying, certainly,
but I want to know about the
work.”</p>

<p>“Oh! <i>The Devout Life?</i>” he replied.
“I will tell you. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
place, a singular fact connected with
it is that the work was completed before
S. Francis was aware that he had
written a book. It happened thus:
A young, beautiful, and wealthy
lady of the fashionable Parisian
world was so impressed by a sermon
preached by the Bishop of Geneva
that she resolved to lead a new life,
and solicited his spiritual advice.
His counsels of enlightened piety
soon taught her that it was possible
to serve God with zeal without absolutely
leaving the world. Seeing her
but seldom, he wrote from time to
time such instructions as he wished
to convey, and also answered her
letters asking for further advice. On
a visit to Chambéry, Mme. de Charmoisy&mdash;for
that was the lady’s name&mdash;showed
these papers to the learned
and pious Père Forrier, rector of the
College of Jesuits at that place. He
was so much struck with their contents
that he had them copied, and
wrote to Francis of Sales, now Bishop
of Geneva, urging him to publish
them. The bishop did not at first
understand what he meant, and replied
that he had no talent for authorship,
and no time to write. When
the matter was explained, and he
ascertained that Père Forrier had
studied and written out what he called
his ‘few miserable notes,’ he exclaimed:
‘Truly, it is a wonderful
thing that, according to these good
people, I have composed a book
without knowing it.’ Very opportunely
there reached him at this juncture
a letter from the secretary of
Henry IV. of France, expressing his
majesty’s earnest wish that Mgr. de
Genève would write a work setting
forth the beauty of religion, and showing
worldly people that a life of piety
was not incompatible with a busy,
active career. ‘No one,’ said the
king, ‘could write such a book but
Mgr. de Genève.’</p>

<p>“Thus pressed on all sides, the
bishop set to work, made some
changes and additions<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> in the manuscript,
and published it under the
now familiar title of <i>Introduction to a
Devout Life</i>.</p>

<p>“The work had no model in French
literature. It was neither apologetic
nor controversial, but purely moral
and advisory; and this was much in a
period torn by religious dissensions and
wars. Its success was enormous. Praises
of the book and its author poured in
upon all sides. Exaggerated encomiums
disturbed the good bishop.
‘What!’ he said, ‘cannot God make
fresh-water springs to come forth
from the jaw-bone of an ass? These
good friends of mine think of nothing
but me and my glory, as though we
might desire any glory for ourselves,
and not rather refer it all to God, who
alone works any good which may be
in us.’</p>

<p>“Meantime, the <i>Introduction</i> was
translated into all languages, and so
widely read<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> that it was called at the
time the <i>breviary</i> of people of the
world.</p>

<p>“The imagery and symbolism of
the book are full of grace and attraction.
It draws illustrations from pictures
and flowers, and its style is rife
with similes and images which light
up the essential solemnity of the subject.
As Sainte-Beuve says, ‘He puts
plenty of sugar and honey on the
edge of the vase.’<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>“But this grace of language and of
style is not obtained at the sacrifice
of strength or of principle. The
work has many passages full of sombre
energy, and, in particular, a
meditation on death (first book),
which displays something of the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
vigor of a similar chapter
(twenty-third of the first book) in
<i>Thomas à Kempis</i>.</p>

<p>“Then, there is a sharpness of penetration
and a delicacy of insight surprising
to those who have not closely
watched the springs of human action
and the workings of the human heart
in themselves as well as in others.
Distinguished moralists, such as
Montaigne and Franklin, have discoursed
eloquently and effectively on
the morals and motives of men, but
you will find in none of them the
elevation and purity of S. Francis of
Sales. Take, for instance, the thirty-sixth
chapter of the third book, in
which he points out the almost imperceptible
motives of partiality and
injustice which prompt us in everyday
life to the most selfish acts, consulting
only interest and passion,
while we pretend to ourselves and
others to be totally unconscious of
anything in our conduct that is not
entirely praiseworthy. Listen and
see how admirably he introduces the
subject: ‘It is reason alone that
makes us men, and yet it is a rare
thing to find men truly reasonable;
because self-love ordinarily puts us
out of the path of reason, leading us
insensibly to a thousand small yet
dangerous injustices and partialities,
which, like the little foxes spoken of
in the <i>Canticle</i> destroy the vines;
for, because they are little, we take
no notice of them; but, being great
in number, they fail not to injure us
considerably.’</p>

<p>“Now, remark how unerringly he
places his finger on spots and blemishes
that to our eyes are apparently
as white as snow:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘Are not the things of which I am
about to speak unjust and unreasonable?
We condemn every trifle in our
neighbors, and excuse ourselves in things
of importance; we want to sell very
dearly, and to buy very cheaply; we desire
that justice should be executed in another
man’s house, but mercy and connivance
in our own; we would have everything
we say taken in good part, but we
are delicate and touchy with regard to
what others say of us; we would insist on
our neighbor parting with his goods, and
taking our money; but is it not more
reasonable that he should keep his
goods, and leave us our money? We
take it ill that he will not accommodate
us; but has he not more reason to be offended
that we should desire to incommode
him?... On all occasions, we
prefer the rich before the poor, although
they be neither of better condition, nor
more virtuous; we even prefer those who
are best clad. We rigorously exact our
own dues, but we desire that others
should be gentle in demanding theirs:
we keep our own rank with precision,
but would have others humble and condescending;
we complain easily of our
neighbors, but none must complain of
us; what we do for others seems always
very considerable, but what others do
for us seems as nothing. We have two
balances: one to weigh to our own advantage,
and the other to weigh in to the
detriment of our neighbor. <i>Deceitful lips</i>,
says the Scripture, <i>have spoken with a
double heart</i>; and to have two weights,
the one greater, with which we receive,
and the other less, with which we deliver,
is an abominable thing in the sight of
God.’”</p>

<p class="p1">“The book must be interesting,”
said I. “You must lend it to
me.”</p>

<p>“Candidly, George,” my cousin
answered, somewhat to my surprise,
“you had better select something
else for your reading; for, if you wish
merely to pass away the time in its
perusal, it will most certainly disappoint
you, and you will find it dry
and dull. If, indeed, you desire to
read it with a motive corresponding
to the author’s aim in writing it, that’s
quite another affair. The book is
for the heart and the soul, not for
the calculating head and worldly
mind. There’s nothing about it of
what your admired Carlyle calls <i>dilettanteism</i>,
and its object is your welfare&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in this world, but in the
next.”</p>

<p>“In what language,” I inquired,
“was this work written?”</p>

<p>“In French, of course.”</p>

<p>“But Francis of Sales was, you
say, a Savoyard?”</p>

<p>“True,” replied Dick; “what
then?”</p>

<p>“Why, perhaps he didn’t write
pure French?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. You are an
American, are you not, George?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am; what then?”</p>

<p>“Why, then, perhaps you don’t
speak the English language correctly.
And that,” continued Dick, “reminds
me, as our late President used
to say, of a little story. You know
that queer old original Major Eustace,
who lives just beyond the lake.
I heard him relate that, when a
young man, he was travelling in Europe,
and found himself one fine day
at Moscow without funds or tidings
from home, except a letter advising
him of the failure of his father’s
house. This was at a time when
travelling facilities were far inferior
to those of the present day. He
could not get away, and so sat down
and studied the Moscow advertisements.
One of them demanded an
English tutor for the two sons (aged
respectively fourteen and sixteen
years) of a Russian nobleman residing
at a well-known château near the city.
Eustace was a college graduate. He
felt himself abundantly qualified for
the position, and made instant application.
He was cordially received
for the chances of obtaining an English
tutor at Moscow were very slim.
The Russian questioned Eustace
very closely as to his acquirements&mdash;this
conversation being, of course, in
French&mdash;and things went on swimmingly
until he asked our American
cousin from what part of England he
came. Eustace replied that he was
an American. The Russian’s face
fell. ‘And what language do they
speak in America?’</p>

<p>“‘In the United States we speak
English,’ replied Eustace.</p>

<p>“‘But it must be a <i>patois</i>,’ objected
the Russian.</p>

<p>“‘Not at all,’ said Eustace. ‘We
have no dialects, and, taken as a body,
the American people speak better
English than the people of England.’</p>

<p>“The Russian could not comprehend
it. The result was that Eustace
was not engaged. Our nobleman went
all the way to St. Petersburg for what
he wanted, and returned home triumphant
with his born-English tutor.
Meantime, Eustace found something
else to do, and remained at Moscow
long enough to acquire the Russian
language, and make many pleasant
acquaintances. Being in London
five years afterwards, he found the
Russian colony there in a fit of Homeric
laughter over the strange mishap
of two young noblemen recently
arrived from Moscow. Eustace at
once recognized the name of the
Russian who insisted that Americans
speak a <i>patois</i>. His sons had been
taught English by the tutor picked
up in St. Petersburg, and, fortified
with plenty of money and excellent
letters of introduction, had been sent
over to acquire the polish of a London
season in the best English society.
In this society, then, they made their
<i>début</i> speaking English fluently in
<i>the broadest Yorkshire dialect</i>!</p>

<p>“Now, to return to your Savoyard
objection,” continued my cousin.
“You must know, my dear George,
that Savoy is essentially French in
tongue and general characteristics of
race. The French language is both
spoken and written there in all its
purity; and many authors of worldwide
reputation as French writers are,
in reality, Savoyards. There is, for
instance, Vaugelas the grammarian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Saint-Réal the historian, Ducis the
poet, the great Joseph de Maistre,
his brother Xavier de Maistre, whose
<i>Voyage autour de ma Chambre</i> I know
you have read; and, in our own day,
Cherbuliez, whose success as a novelist
has made the Parisian romancers
look sharply to their laurels. I have
reserved mention of S. Francis of
Sales for a special reason. He wrote
at a period when the French language
under the influence of Malherbe was
soon to settle down into its modern
form; and so pure is his language
and phraseology, even tried by the
highest French standard, that he is
one of the model authors adopted by
the French Academy when its celebrated
<i>Dictionary</i> of the language was
undertaken. The list of prose writers
included, among others, the names
of Amyot, Montaigne, Charron,
Arnauld, S. Francis of Sales, Duplessis-Mornay,
Cardinal du Perron, etc.,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> S. Francis of Sales is thus, you
perceive, a French classic. The
English translations we have of his
works,” continued my cousin, “fail
to do him justice.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said I, “the old story&mdash;<i>traduttore</i>&mdash;<i>traditore</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>&mdash;as
the Italians
say.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so, for the sense and
substance; and then, for the form
and setting, a period of nearly three
hundred years has so modified shades
of signification and value in words
which to-day apparently have the
same general meaning, that in our
modern rendering the subtle aroma
and the more delicate beauties of
thought and language appear to evaporate
in the process of translation.</p>

<p>“There is a certain charming simplicity
and quaintness in the original
to which our grand modern style refuses
to bend; and it appears to me
that we might have had an English
version of the <i>Devout Life</i> really redolent
of its author’s spirit if it could
possibly have been done by one of
that noble band of young Jesuit
martyrs judicially murdered by Queen
Elizabeth&mdash;say Campion or Southwell,
for instance, who wrote in the
English of Shakespeare’s day&mdash;a period
exactly corresponding with that
of S. Francis de Sales.”</p>

<p>“To sum it all up, then,” said I,
“you ask me to accept this work as
perfection, and yet refuse me an opportunity
of judging for myself.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, George; for,
although I contend that it is admirable
and, indeed, unsurpassed for
its purpose, I have already said that
a reader seeking in it purely literary
gratification would most certainly be
disappointed. I will say more, for
I will not allow you to monopolize
the functions of <i>advocatus diaboli</i>:
the book, to our nineteenth century
eyes, has several defects.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by calling
me the devil’s advocate?”</p>

<p>“Well, merely this, Cousin George.
In our church, whenever it is proposed
to canonize as a saint a person
of holy life, there is a member of the
commission appointed to examine the
case, whose duty it is rigidly to scrutinize
all the testimony presented as
to the holy life of the deceased, to
require the strictest proof, and to
present and urge every valid objection
to its saintliness, such as charges
of any irregularity or lapse in conduct,
morals, or faith. This official,
in short, is a sort of infernal prosecuting
attorney, and has hence received
the descriptive nickname of <i>advocatus diaboli</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Now, it appears to me,
Cousin George, that, from the moment
our conversation on the <i>Devout
Life</i> began, you have been plying
his vocation pretty vigorously.”</p>

<p>I could not deny it, so I said nothing,
and allowed Gaston to go on.</p>

<p>“No; so far from claiming perfection
for the work, I will volunteer a
criticism or two upon it. In the first
place, there is an excess of symbolism,
and the multitude of comparisons
and images becomes fatiguing.
Many of these images are full of grace
and simplicity, especially those drawn
from the writer’s observation of nature;
for S. Francis of Sales, as we
gather from this book, had a quick
and sympathetic appreciation of the
charm of landscapes, the song of
birds, the fascination of flowers, and
the thousand beauties of nature visible
only to one who truly loves nature,
and sincerely worships nature’s
God. But there is an excess of all
this; and when he gets beyond the
line of personal sympathy and observation,
the comparisons become
stiff, and frequently violate good
taste. Those drawn from natural
history, for instance, are strained and
incongruous. The writer must have
found his Paphlagonian partridges
with two hearts in Pliny. There are
many things, too, which to us appear
to be in excessively bad taste;
but that is a defect not chargeable to
the author individually, but to the
prevalent style of the age in which
he lived. After all, there are ‘spots on
the sun.’ S. Francis of Sales did not
write for fame as an author, nor, indeed,
from any worldly motive. A
‘classic style’ and ‘the French
Academy’ were inducements which
never engaged his attention. There
is nothing of the rhetorician in his
phrase, for it is almost familiar in its
ease and simplicity. But there’s
the tea-bell, my dear George, probably
a happy release for one of us,
for I fear I have bored you dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, my dear Dick,
for I have been as much edified as
interested in the saintly life you have
revealed to me.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear boy, I haven’t told
you the half of it; nor, indeed, do I
know it thoroughly. But if it at all
interests you, here it is.”</p>

<p>I read it, and have since read the
lives and some few of the works of
several other saints, with what result
it does not interest the public to
know. I can only say that I am
going to fight it out on my present
line if it takes till doomsday. Cousin
Dick and I are firmer friends
than ever, and Aunt Mildred from
time to time asks me, with a slight
tone of sarcasm, if I saw any fashionable
bonnets at our church last Sabbath?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="pc1">CONFESSION.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">At</span> our return, we found my mother
had prepared the dinner as usual on
the days we went into the country.
We joyfully seated ourselves at the
table. What is more delightful than
a family dinner? And we were all
united. Louis was also in our midst.
Victor was uncommonly lively that
evening. His face, so open, intelligent,
and kind, was radiant. I had
never seen him so social and witty.
His animation enlivened us all&mdash;we
loved him so much! Excellent
man! what made him so happy was
the remembrance of the good deed
he had done at the peril of his life.
I asked him more than twenty times
that evening if he felt any worse, and
if it were not advisable to send for a
physician. He invariably replied
that he felt as well as the day before,
and even better. But his cough
grew worse from that time, and
caused me serious alarm. During
dinner we conversed on general subjects,
and afterwards went to the
<i>salon</i>. Victor installed himself beside
the blazing fire which I always
had made for him in the evening.
My mother and sister went up to
their own apartments. We were
thus left alone with M. Louis Beauvais.
He turned towards Victor with
a look full of respect and affection,
and I observed with astonishment that
tears were streaming from his eyes.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said he to me, “I
must appear strangely to you. Ah!
that is not the worst of it. I am a
great sinner.”</p>

<p>Victor tried to stop him.</p>

<p>“No,” said he; “I will not keep
silence. Mme. Barnier must know
everything, as well as you, noble-hearted
man, whom I dare not call
my friend: I feel too unworthy.”</p>

<p>He seated himself, and, sadly gazing
into the fire, began his story in a
tone as grave and sorrowful as if he
were making a solemn avowal of his
faults before dying:</p>

<p>Ten years ago, said he, I was
a Christian, not only in name, but in
heart and soul. My mother, a pious,
energetic woman, such as we do not
see in our day, brought me up with
extreme care, and I did my utmost
to correspond to her efforts. It is
so easy and delightful to practise
one’s religion when one has faith, and
feels that his endeavors are at once
pleasing to a mother and to God!
My other studies over, I became a
candidate for the Polytechnic School,
but was not successful in my application.
I then entered another, in
order to learn civil engineering. By
the end of a year, I had given up all
my pious habits through want of
moral courage. My principles, however,
remained firm enough to condemn
me and fill me with remorse,
but they were incapable of restraining
one who had imbibed a taste for
error. Even my mother’s death and
her last words, though they affected
me, did not bring me to a sense of
duty. A short time after I completed
my studies in civil engineering, my
father gave me possession of what I
inherited from my mother, and asked
what course I intended to pursue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
“Remain at home,” I replied,” and
work under the direction of M.
C&mdash;&mdash;,” an architect of the department,
and a friend of the family. My
father gave his consent to this.</p>

<p>Left to myself, and master of my
time and property, I made no delay
in commencing a life of dissipation
and pleasure. My father was, above
all things, a man of forethought and
calculation, and my conduct disgusted
him. We had several painful
disputes, and at last he declared, to
use his own expressive language, he
would give up the reins, and cease
to reproach me, but I must not
thenceforth expect of him the least
advice or even aid, if I needed it.
He then centred all his affections
on my brother and sister. As for
me, I had begun by being idle and
extravagant: I soon became openly
irreligious. My religious principles
were a restraint, and I determined to
throw them aside. I thought this
would be easy. And I did prove
myself uncommonly impious when
the preacher we had some months
ago told us so many plain, wholesome
truths. I was not one of those
guilty of disorderly conduct, whom
all respectable people must condemn;
but&mdash;the acknowledgment is
due you&mdash;I approved of it, contemptible
and wicked as it was. My conscience
was now roused, and remorse
filled my soul with secret anger.</p>

<p>My mother being dead, there was
no longer any one at home to speak
to me of religious things. My father
is an honorable, upright man, and attentive
to his business, but as regardless
of another world as if there were
none. My young brother is pious to
a certain degree, I suppose, but he is
timid and reserved. Only my sister
remains. Aline left boarding-school
about six months ago. She is nearly
ten years younger than I, and bears
a striking resemblance to my mother.
She has the same kindness of heart
and the same tone of piety, at once
fervent and rational, which I always
loved and admired in my mother. I
had been separated from my sister
many years, and when I met her
again, I was struck, with this resemblance,
and at once conceived so
much affection and respect for her as
to astonish myself.</p>

<p>As soon as Aline returned home,
the appearance of everything
changed: the house became more
attractive. I certainly do not wish
to impute any blame to my father&mdash;I
love and respect him too much for
that&mdash;but you know as well as I that
a house is not what it should be that
has no woman to preside over it.
An Arabian poet says the mistress of
a house is its soul, and he is right.
After my mother’s death, the house
became gloomy, but there was a
marked change when Aline returned.
It seemed as if my mother had come
back after a long absence to diffuse
once more around her cheerfulness,
order, and piety.</p>

<p>But the superintendence of the
household affairs, and her obligations
to society, did not wholly fill up
Aline’s time. Like her whose living
image she was, she was eager to extend
her knowledge. Before her return,
my father had subscribed for
that wretched journal which is the
delight of the unbeliever, or those
who wish to pass as such. Aline
sometimes read it, but she disliked it,
as you may suppose. She imparted
her impressions to me, but I did not
conceal from her my sympathy with
its irreligious views.</p>

<p>“Well, I do not agree with it in
the least,” said she; “and, as I like to
know what is going on, I wish I
could subscribe for M. Barnier’s paper.
Mme. C&mdash;&mdash; has lent it to me for
some time. It is an able, thoughtful
journal, and edited by a sincere Catholic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
That is the kind of a newspaper
that suits me.”</p>

<p>“Then, order it to be sent you.”</p>

<p>“That would be ridiculous. A
young girl cannot subscribe for a
newspaper.”</p>

<p>“I see no other way of having it.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, there is. If you
were obliging, you would see the way
at once.”</p>

<p>“And subscribe for you!... I
subscribe for a <i>journal de sacristie</i>?...
That would be going rather
too far; I should be laughed at.”</p>

<p>“You must have publicly compromised
yourself, then, to fear making
people talk by subscribing for a respectable
paper.” ...</p>

<p>The cut was well aimed. I reddened,
but made no reply, and went
away. That night I subscribed for
your paper, and received my first
number. Of course I opened it at
once, out of perverse curiosity. I
should have been overjoyed to find a
single flaw in it.</p>

<p>A short time after this, the incident
at the cathedral occurred. As
I have already told you, I was not
among those who made a disturbance
at the church door, but I was
with them in heart. Père Laurent
was repulsive to me, as well as to
most of those who displayed their
anger in so reprehensible a manner.
He was everywhere the topic of conversation.
At home, my sister, who
never lost one of his sermons, annoyed
me with his praises. Above
all, she irritated me by repeating his
very words&mdash;words that seemed chosen
expressly to disturb me and force
me to reflect.</p>

<p>The day after that atrocious manifestation,
I eagerly opened your journal.
I was sure you would speak of
the outbreak of the previous day,
and wished to see how far you would
condemn it. The article surpassed
my expectations. You showed
yourself more courageous than ever.
Never had you written anything that
so directly hit my case. You made
use of certain phrases that reminded
me of my shameful course, my base
inclinations, and my secret remorse,
and in so forcible a manner that the
very perusal made me tremble with
anger. That night, at our club&mdash;that
well-known circle of young men devoid
of reason, and so many men of
riper years even more thoughtless&mdash;we
had a great deal to say about the
occurrence of the previous day, and
your article of that morning. There
was a general indignation against the
preacher, and that excited by what
you had written was still stronger.</p>

<p>One of the <i>habitués</i> of the club&mdash;one
of those men who assume the
right of imposing their opinions on
others about every subject&mdash;seriously
declared he had made a very important
discovery: the clerical party
wished to overrule the city, and assert
its adverse authority as in the fearful
times of the middle ages; but,
however well contrived the plot
might be, it had not escaped the sagacious
eye of the speaker. The
Conference of S. Vincent de Paul,
more flourishing than ever; the new
development given to the journal you
edit; the arrival of an eloquent
preacher&mdash;were they not all so many
signs that ought to arouse us to the
imminence and extent of the danger?</p>

<p>The simplest and worst members
of the club allowed themselves to
be influenced by this absurd declamation.
I was, I confess, of the
number. Others shrugged their
shoulders. The orator perceived it.</p>

<p>“Ah! you smile, messieurs; you
think I exaggerate! In a year you
will confess I was right, but then it
will be too late! Your wives will
have become devotees, the very
thought of whose bigotry is enough
to make anybody shudder; your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
daughters will only aspire to the happiness
of entering a convent; the
theatres will be closed for want of
patronage; and, if any one wishes an
office, it will only be obtained by
presenting a certificate of confession.
<i>Allez! allez!</i> when that black-robed
tribe undertakes any scheme, it
knows how to bring it about. Instead
of shrugging your shoulders
when I reveal what is going on, you
would do better to take proper precautions.
It is high time.”</p>

<p>A young fop in the assembly, the
head clerk of a notary, notorious for
his volubility, his shallowness, and
his assurance, rose and took up the
thread of discourse in his turn:</p>

<p>“I agree with what M. Simon has
just said. We must consider the
means of utterly routing this dark
race. The shortest course would be
to attack their leader. I will take
that on myself. Barnier shall hear
from me.”</p>

<p>“No rashness!” was the exclamation
on all sides. “We must beware
of making a martyr of him!”</p>

<p>“What course shall we take, then?”
asked some of the party.</p>

<p>“Intimidate him,” said a voice.
“Write him a letter of warning of so
serious a character as to make him
desist.”</p>

<p>“That is also a bad plan,” objected
M. Simon. “Anonymous letters are
treated with contempt, or are laid
before the public. In either case, the
effect would be unfavorable to us.”</p>

<p>The young fop who had begun
the subject now resumed:</p>

<p>“M. Simon, who has so clairvoyant
an eye with respect to danger,
ought himself to suggest some way
of bringing Barnier to reason.”</p>

<p>M. Simon assumed a solemn air:
“I only know of one way, but that
is a good one. We must bribe him,
not to withdraw from the paper&mdash;that
would be a false step, for another
would take his place, and continue
to annoy us&mdash;but to induce
him, in consideration of a certain
sum, to wage henceforth only an
apparent war on us. That is the
best thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the young fop, “it
is hardly worth while to criticise
others, and then propose something
not half so good. Barnier is not to
be bribed.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked M. Simon.</p>

<p>“Because a man whose opinions
are the result of conviction can never
be bought. He fights for his flag,
and is not much concerned about
anything else.”</p>

<p>“Convictions!&mdash;flag!&mdash;disinterestedness,
indeed!” retorted M. Simon,
with a gesture of supreme contempt.</p>

<p>It was in vain to say that most of
us had carefully observed you, and
were not mistaken as to your character.
We were nearly all of the
clerk’s opinion. For once in his life,
the fellow had a correct notion. We
then separated without coming to any
decision, but each one promised to
think of some means of bringing you
to reason, as we expressed it. I
dwelt on the subject the whole evening,
and was still thinking of it the
next day when I took my place
among the family at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Aline was at that time greatly interested
in the <i>soirée</i> to which you
were afterwards invited, and the preliminaries
were discussed at table.
To my great astonishment, she proposed
to place your name on the list
of invitations. This proposition
made me angry, and I flatly declared
it absurd. I was sure my father
would make a similar reply. I had
no idea he would open the doors of
his <i>salon</i> to you, for I knew there
was no similarity of opinion between
you. The result was precisely contrary
to my expectations. Was my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
father desirous of gratifying Aline?
Or did he wish to seize an opportunity
of showing how little value he
attached to my opinion? I know
not. But he allowed me to finish
what I had to say, and then said, in
a dry tone:</p>

<p>“Aline, send M. Barnier an invitation.
It is my wish.”</p>

<p>I was confounded. In my fury, I
inwardly swore to be revenged.
The means of intimidating you,
which the members of the club had
not been able to find without compromising
themselves, I thought I
had discovered myself the night before.
I communicated my plan to
two of my friends whose names I
will not give. They declared it excellent,
and promised to second me.</p>

<p>What took place you know, but I
will give you some details impossible
for you to have ascertained. I did
not attend the <i>soirée</i>, but one of my
accomplices was there to keep me informed
of your movements. When
you were ready to leave, he came to
my room to notify me. It took only
a moment to disguise ourselves. We
went out by a private door, and
dogged your steps. Ah! my dear
friend, what infamous behavior!
What had you done to me that I
should thus dare violate in your person
the laws of hospitality which
even savages respect?</p>

<p>At this revelation, I turned pale.
M. Louis Beauvais perceived it.</p>

<p>“Is not such an act unpardonable,
madame?” said he. “And do you
not look upon me as worthy only of
your contempt and hatred?”</p>

<p>“I have forgiven those who committed
this wrong, whoever they
might be,” I replied. “Now I know
it was you, and see how fully you repent
of it, I forgive you even more
willingly.”</p>

<p>Thank you, madame, said he;
but let me assure you that, culpable
as my intentions were, they were less
so than they must have seemed to you.
We were desirous of intimidating M.
Barnier, and making him believe he
exposed himself to constant serious
danger by the boldness of the course
he had taken. We did not&mdash;I mistake&mdash;I
did not intend to show any
physical violence, for that I considered
base and criminal. I was indignant
when I saw one of our number
strike him. I have ever since regarded
that young man with profound
contempt. I had more than
one fit of remorse that night. The
next morning, Aline, after accosting
me, said:</p>

<p>“You know what happened to M.
Barnier last night after leaving us.
It is infamous! It must have been a
plot. I am sure you know the guilty
authors! Who are they? They
ought to be punished.”</p>

<p>“How should I know them?” I
exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>“You know them only too well,”
said Aline, regarding me with an air
of severity; ... “but you are
not willing to betray your friends....
What friends!”</p>

<p>I endeavored to appear unconcerned.
She continued looking at
me with a steadiness that made me
shiver.</p>

<p>“Do not add to my distress,” said
she. “Do not lay aside the only
virtue you have left, my poor brother&mdash;your
customary frankness! I
understand it all, and know what I
ought to say to you, but words fail
me. Ah! if our poor mother were
still alive!” ...</p>

<p>Aline went away without another
word. As for me, I remained motionless
and silent for some moments,
by turns filled with shame, remorse,
and anger.... It would seem as if
so grave an occurrence should have
led me to serious reflection. I felt inclined
to it at first, but resisted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
inclination. I found excuses for myself,
and soon thought no more of it.</p>

<p>I continued, therefore, to live as I
had for five years, one pleasure succeeding
another, and spending my
property without reflecting what I
should do hereafter. But the day
was at hand when I found myself in
a critical position in consequence of
my prodigality.</p>

<p>When my father, in order to avert
cause for contention, put me in possession
of my mother’s property, I at
once took my papers to a man in
whom I placed entire confidence. I
did this in order to throw off all care.
He had been for a long time my father’s
cashier. He was and is honesty
itself.</p>

<p>“F. Martin,” said I, “here is
all I possess. It will be a care for
me to keep these papers and collect
my income. Do me the favor to
take charge of my property.”</p>

<p>F. Martin was confused and gratified
at such a proof of confidence.
But his pleasure was somewhat modified
when I added the following
words:</p>

<p>“F. Martin, I attach one condition
to this arrangement: you are
not to take advantage of it to sermonize
me. I now tell you, with a
frankness that will preclude all surprise,
I wish to amuse myself....
To what degree, or how long, I cannot
say, but such is my present intention,
that is certain.”</p>

<p>“O M. Louis, if your mother
could only hear you!”</p>

<p>“F. Martin,” said I, with a gesture,
as if to take back my portfolio,
“if you are going to begin to preach
to me, take care!... I shall give
my papers to some one who may rob
me. Then, instead of merely curtailing
my property a little, I shall spend
it all in two years, or four at the
furthest; or rather, we shall spend it
between us.”</p>

<p>“Dreadful boy! I always said you
had the faculty of making everybody
yield to you. Well, I will do as you
wish.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is right. One word
more. When I have but twenty
thousand francs left, you may warn
me&mdash;not before!”</p>

<p>Things went on thus till a few days
ago. I spent my property with a
rapidity that frightened me when I
thought of it. My father perceived
it. My extravagance excited his indignation,
but, faithful to his resolution
to avoid all contention, he forebore
saying anything. Not quite a fortnight
ago, I met with a sad disappointment.
An old aunt of mine
died. I had calculated on being her
heir, but she left all she had to my
sister and other relatives, and gave
me nothing. My unwise conduct
had for some time prejudiced her
against me. This disappointment
made me quite thoughtful. I wrote
F. Martin that I wished to know
the exact state of my affairs. The
next day Martin arrived at the appointed
hour. He was pale and agitated&mdash;pitifully
so.</p>

<p>“M. Louis,” said he, “you anticipated
me. I was going to request
an interview with you. You have
now only twenty thousand francs!”</p>

<p>I made a strong effort to control
myself, and replied, with a smiling
air: “Well done! that is rather fast
work!”</p>

<p>“So fast that I can hardly believe
you have come to this. But it is
really so!”</p>

<p>“Where are the twenty thousand
francs, Martin?”</p>

<p>“Why, I have not got them, M.
Louis! I have only five thousand
left besides what you took.”</p>

<p>At this, my strength almost failed
me. I at once realized I was completely
ruined. Fifteen months before,
I had withdrawn twenty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
francs from Martin’s hands under
the pretext of investing them in a
particularly advantageous manner.
A trip to Germany, play, and some
pressing debts absorbed this sum
without Martin’s knowing it. I quietly
dismissed him, saying I would
see him again the next day. Left
alone, I balanced my accounts.
Alas! my affairs were desperate!
The five thousand francs in Martin’s
possession were all I had left, and
my debts amounted to four times
that sum!</p>

<p>All day yesterday I remained stupefied,
as it were, at so unexpected a
disclosure. My father had gone to
Paris. I resolved to take refuge in
the country, and come to some decision.
I went, scarcely knowing what
I was about, angry with myself, with
everybody else, and desperate. All
night I sought some way of escape
from the terrible blow that had befallen
me. I walked to and fro. From
anger I sank into the most profound
dejection. The very thought of applying
myself to any occupation whatever
appeared, above all, intolerable.</p>

<p>When morning came, I mechanically
went to walk beside the river
that runs about a hundred yards from
our house, and fell into a gloomy reverie.
The sleepless nights, the rioting,
the habits to which I had successively
given myself up for years, the
painful anxiety of the previous night,
had excited and weakened my nervous
system. I was, as it were, deprived
of my reason.</p>

<p>While I was thus lingering on the
shore, it seemed as if a mysterious
voice invited me to bury myself in the
current before me. A terrible struggle
took place between my reason, the
instinct that restrained me, and the
hallucination that kept drawing me
nearer the bank. Reason failed me.
In a fit of despair, I cast myself into
the stream. As soon as I felt the
cold water, my reason, my faith,
awoke as ardent as in the days of my
boyhood. A cry issued from the very
depths of my soul: “O Mary, save
me!” It would be impossible to tell
you with what fervor, what terror, I
uttered this short prayer&mdash;impossible,
also, to express the immense joy that
filled my heart when I realized I was
saved. But what confusion mingled
with this joy&mdash;what gratitude, too,
what admiration of the designs of
God, when I saw it was you who had
rescued me at the peril of your life!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p class="pc1">BROTHER AND SISTER.</p>

<p class="p1">M. Louis Beauvais had finished
his story.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Victor, in the
cheering, confidential tone of one
friend who wishes to encourage another,
“what are you going to
do?”</p>

<p>“That is precisely the question
that preoccupies me. In fact, I see
no way of solving it. Were you to
ask me what I am not going to do,
oh! then I should not be embarrassed
for a reply. At all events, had I even
the means, I should not wish to continue
the life I have led. Nor do I
any longer desire to escape from the
trying position I am in by having
recourse to the cowardly, criminal
means I took in a moment of madness.
Suicide fills me with horror!
One must behold death face to face,
as I have to-day, to realize how easily
a man can deceive himself. I had
really arrived at such a state of indifference
and insensibility that it seemed
as if I had never had any religion;
but the terrible thought no sooner
sprang up in my soul that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
about to appear before God, than I
found myself as sincere a believer as
on the day of my first communion.
My whole life passed in review before
me, and I condemned myself
without awaiting the divine sentence.
When I recall the inexpressible terror
of that moment; when I remember
if God had not sent you to my assistance,
and that, had it not been for
your heroism, I should have been for
ever lost, there springs up in my heart
a continually increasing gratitude to
my heavenly Father, and to you who
were the agent of his mercy.”</p>

<p>“Then, my friend,” replied Victor
gravely, “you will allow me to make
one request.”</p>

<p>“Consider whatever you would ask
of me granted in advance.”</p>

<p>“Then, forget the past six or eight
years of your life, and become again
what you were under your mother’s
influence.”</p>

<p>“I pledge you my word to do so,
and hope by the divine assistance
never to break my promise&mdash;a promise
I make with inexpressible joy.
But that is not all. What course do
you advise me to take?”</p>

<p>“If I may form an opinion of your
sister from what you say, she must be
a person of intelligence, kind feelings,
and decision. In your place, I would
go to her, make known my exact
situation, and ask her advice.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is the best course to
take. The idea pleases me. I will
put it in execution this very evening.
My father is to be absent a day or
two longer. I shall have a good opportunity
of talking freely with Aline.
I will go directly to her when I leave
you. To-morrow morning I will return
and give you an account of our
interview.”</p>

<p>Louis left us a few moments after.
We commended him to God with all
our hearts at our evening devotions.
It was so impressive a spectacle to
behold a soul break loose from past
habits, and return to God humiliated
and conscious of his weakness&mdash;repentant,
and burning with ardor to
enter upon a new life.</p>

<p>During the night, Victor was seriously
ill. Fearing he was going to
die, I exclaimed, in a moment of
anguish:</p>

<p>“Oh! that unfortunate adventure!
That wretched young man will be the
death of you!”</p>

<p>“Take that back, dear,” said Victor;
“it pains me. Instead of deploring
this occurrence, and calling it
unfortunate, you should thank God.
He has thus granted my dearest wish.
From the time I found my days numbered,
I prayed God to grant me
every possible opportunity of showing
how earnestly I wished to serve him
during the short time left me on earth.
He has now granted my desire. If
my going into the water to-day leads
to my death, I shall have the infinite
joy of being in a certain sense a
martyr, for I fully realized the danger.
But an interior voice whispered:
‘There is a soul to save,’ and I
plunged into the river.... Others
would have done the same, but God
does not give every one such an opportunity.
I thank him for having
granted it to me.”</p>

<p>By degrees Victor’s alarming symptoms
wore off. When he awoke the
next morning, he was much better
than I had dared hope. He recalled
with a lively joy the events of the
previous day, and expressed an eager
desire to know what Louis and his
sister had decided upon.</p>

<p>We were not kept in suspense long.
Louis arrived about nine o’clock.
Seeing his face was calm and happy,
my poor husband manifested a livelier
satisfaction than I had ever known
him to express.</p>

<p>“Sit down there,” said he, pointing
to an arm-chair beside his bed, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
give us the details of all you have
done.”</p>

<p>As we agreed upon last evening,
replied Louis, I went directly home
after leaving you, and inquired if my
sister was in. They told me she was.
I went to her room. It was vacant.
A servant informed me that she had
given up her old chamber some weeks
before, and now occupied my mother’s.
I found Aline sitting in the
middle of the room beside a stand, in
the same arm-chair my mother made
use of to the last. I cannot express
the emotion that overpowered me
when I entered. The aspect of the
room, the sight of the well-known
furniture, Aline’s grave air, and her
resemblance to my mother, all carried
me back ten years. It seemed as if I
were once more in the presence of
her whom I loved so much, but
whose counsels I had followed so
poorly. My agitation increased when
Aline sprang towards me, clasped me
in her arms, and covered my face
with her tears.</p>

<p>“Wicked, wicked boy, she cried;
you wished to put an end to your
life! How sinful in you! and what
sorrow for us! Oh! conceal nothing
from me.... You are very unhappy,
then?... You have no confidence
in me?... Come, tell me all.
Leave me no longer in a state of uncertainty.
And, first, have you renounced
your horrible project?”</p>

<p>Her voice betrayed such profound
emotion, her eyes such tender
affection and deep anxiety, that I was
affected to tears. I began by begging
pardon for all the anxiety I had
caused her. I pledged my word to
enter upon a new life. When we
were both somewhat calmer, I told
her all I had related to you. At the
end of the account, she looked at me
as a mother would at her son, and
said:</p>

<p>“Louis, the hand of God has visibly
interposed in your behalf. Everything
shows you would have been
drowned. And what a horrible end!&mdash;in
that river where so few people
go, especially the spot you chose, had
not Providence, at the very moment
you plunged into the water, sent a
man, a noble-hearted man, to save
you at the peril of his life. That is
not all. When you were able to
thank your deliverer, you found it was&mdash;the
very man who had already
been brought to death’s door through
your fault. If I am not deceived,
this is a wonderful interposition of
Providence. You have been a great
sinner, my poor boy, and your conversion
had to be effected by a great
sacrifice. This sacrifice has been
offered by M. Barnier in risking his
life in order to restore you to existence,
which you wished to deprive
yourself of. I believe&mdash;pardon my
great frankness&mdash;God wished, I believe,
to inspire you with thorough
repentance by showing you your victim
under the form of your deliverer.
Oh! if this repentance is not lasting,
I shall tremble at the thought of the
chastisement that the justice of God,
weary of pardoning you, has in reserve.
But, no!&mdash;there is no fear of
that. And now, what are you going
to do?”</p>

<p>“Put an end to my idle life.”</p>

<p>“Very well. It was idleness especially
that caused your ruin. But
what occupation will suit you? No
imprudent heroism! You must do
something that will be congenial.”</p>

<p>“I am an engineer. It is time to
remember it. I am going to Paris.
Either there or elsewhere I can easily
find a place in some manufactory.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Father is to return
to-morrow evening. What has occurred
cannot be concealed from
him. I am even of the opinion it
would be best to tell him the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>truth. Only ... you will allow
me to speak with the frankness of a
sister who loves you, will you not?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes. Speak to me as our
mother would.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I must acknowledge
father is extremely offended with you.
He is kind, very kind, as you know,
but he cannot endure want of calculation,
especially in money matters,
and your manner of conducting has
excited his indignation. I fear,
therefore, he will at first be greatly
irritated at learning what has taken
place. Public rumor will at once inform
him of it, so that, when he sees
you for the first time, you will not be
able to induce him to listen to you.
With your consent, I will talk with
him first. To prevent a premature
explanation with him, I propose you
should go and pass two or three
days with Aunt Mary. She is now
at her country-seat in M&mdash;&mdash;. It is
not far off. I can easily send you
word when it is time for you to return.”</p>

<p>I need not say with what gratitude
I accepted this proposal, which revealed
the kindness of a sister, the
delicacy of a woman, and the prudence
of a mother.</p>

<p>Aline continued: “I have two
more requests to make. If you were
a different person, I might hesitate.
But you were once pious. You are
better instructed in our religion than
most of the poor young men of our
day. In a word, you have never
lost your faith. Do not delay having
recourse to the remedy. Go to confession
as soon as possible. Confession
develops repentance, puts a seal
on our good resolutions, and confers
a special grace to keep them. I
speak as I think. A repentance that
remains purely human cannot be
lasting.”</p>

<p>I promised to go to confession to
Father&mdash;&mdash;, and shall keep my promise.</p>

<p>“One favor more,” resumed Aline.
“It is a somewhat delicate matter,
but let us talk with the same freedom
and simplicity that we did in our
childhood. That is the shortest way
to come to an understanding. You
say you are fifteen thousand francs in
debt. Knowing my father’s disposition
as I do, I am sure this will
cause trouble if he knows it. He is
a man who would forgive your spending
a hundred thousand francs, but a
debt of five hundred would make him
extremely angry. This is strange,
but it is so. And you may be sure
as soon as your creditors hear of
your ruin, they will come upon you.
We must, therefore, hasten to forestall
them. We must settle with
them where they are. Will you permit
me to render you a little service?...
Sit down here, and draw up, as
papa would say, a schedule of your
debts. I will give it to our head
clerk to-morrow, bind him to secrecy,
and before noon you will be free from
debt.”</p>

<p>I was profoundly moved by so
much generosity, and so profuse in
my thanks as to greatly touch Aline
herself. But she concealed her emotion
under a lively, playful manner.
I had to make out a list at once. I
did so, and gave it to Aline. She
took it with a smile, and folded it up
without looking at it. There were
two small sheets, one of which was
nearly blank.</p>

<p>“Why two papers?” she asked
mechanically.</p>

<p>“One contains the list&mdash;the sad
list; the other is a note which”....</p>

<p>“Ah! that is too much! Louis, my
poor Louis, you are only half converted!
You do not really love me!
You are unwilling to receive anything
from me. You would deprive me of
the pleasure of giving this to you.
Ah! that is wrong. Oh! the contemptible
<i>rôle</i> you wish me to play!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>I lend it to you! Fie, fie!” ...</p>

<p>So saying, Aline tore up the unfortunate
note.</p>

<p>The night was far advanced before
we separated. I had already bidden
my sister good-night. She retained
my hand in hers, and, looking at me
with a caressing air, said:</p>

<p>“Louis, one favor more! Let us
say our night-prayers together at the
foot of that bed where our dear mother
made us say them so often. We
will pray for her. She watches over
us. What has happened to you is a
proof of it.”</p>

<p>We sank on our knees beside each
other. Aline said the prayers aloud.
I repeated them with my lips and in
my heart, and with so much joy and
emotion that I melted into tears.</p>

<p>This morning I took leave of
Aline. She means to come here herself,
in order to express her gratitude.
My mother could not feel more.
Oh! how she loves you! As for
me, I am going away ruined, but
happier than if my fortune were increased
tenfold. Pray for me. And
you, my dear friend, take care of
yourself. I trembled yesterday at
the thought of the danger to which
you had exposed yourself in order to
save my life. I trembled as I came
here, fearing your heroic imprudence
might have led to fatal results!
Thank God! there is nothing serious.
But redouble your precautions; I
shall need you for a long while. You
will be my best guide in the new way
upon which I have now entered.</p>

<p>Louis then departed, leaving us
exceedingly happy at the favorable
turn in his affairs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="pc1">ALINE’S HOPES.</p>

<p class="p1">The second day after Louis’ departure,
we had in the afternoon an
agreeable surprise: Aline called to
see us. All that Louis had told
us about her prepossessed us in
her favor. The sight of her only
increased our disposition to love
her.</p>

<p>Aline was at the time I am speaking
of&mdash;and still is&mdash;a fine-looking woman,
tall, well-formed, and with a pleasing,
intelligent face. Her manner is
a little cold at first, but her reserve is
not unpleasing, for it indicates a
thoughtful mind. When she came
into the room, my husband and I
were reading. She went directly to
Victor, and with emotion, but without
any embarrassment, said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I am late in expressing
my gratitude. Pardon this delay.
It has not been without good reasons.
I was expecting my father every moment,
and was greatly preoccupied
with all I had to communicate, as
well as about the reply he would
make.” ...</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” replied Victor
gently, “there is no need of excusing
yourself. I am happy, very happy,
to see you, but had no right to expect
your visit.”</p>

<p>“No right, monsieur?... What!
did you not save my brother’s life?...
And was it not you the unhappy
fellow had before” ...</p>

<p>“O mademoiselle! do me the
favor never to mention that circumstance!”</p>

<p>“You are generous, monsieur!
But that is no reason why we should
show ourselves ungrateful&mdash;rather the
contrary. Louis and I can never
forget that, before you saved his life,
he had injured you to such a degree
that he can never be sufficiently repentant.
As to my father, I have
not dared inform him of these details
too painful to be acknowledged. My
father, alas! is not religious. Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>’
fault would seem so enormous to him
that he would never forgive him.”</p>

<p>“It is, however, of but little account.
If harm has resulted from it,
Louis was only the involuntary cause.
Let us adore the divine decrees, and
forgive our poor friend. He had
not, after all, any very criminal intentions.”</p>

<p>Aline looked at Victor with a sadness
she could not wholly conceal.
His wasted features, his eyes hollowed
by suffering, his air of languor,
nothing escaped her observation.</p>

<p>“I wish I could think so,” murmured
she, as if speaking to herself.
“Ah! poor Louis, what remorse he
must feel!”</p>

<p>This allusion to Victor’s sad condition
brought tears to my eyes.
Victor suspected my emotion, and at
once changed the subject.</p>

<p>“M. Louis has become my friend,”
said he to Aline; “therefore pardon
my curiosity, mademoiselle, if it is indiscreet.
May we hope to see him
again soon? Is M. Beauvais greatly
offended with him?”</p>

<p>Everything is arranged for the
best, though not without difficulty.
My father was not originally wealthy.
It has only been by dint of order,
economy, and industry, that he has
attained the position he now occupies.
When he learned that Louis
had lost, or rather squandered, his
maternal inheritance, his anger was
fearful. But by degrees I made him
comprehend that Louis, though ruined,
had shown new resolution&mdash;that
he was willing to work; he wished to
become useful, and regain all he had
lost. My father then grew calm. And
yet all my fears were not allayed. I
had to tell him of Louis’ sad attempt
at suicide, of which he was still ignorant,
but which he could not fail to
learn. I told him of it, dwelling on
your devotedness, which struck him
most of all.</p>

<p>“Has Louis shown himself duly
grateful to M. Barnier for the service?”
he asked. I replied that he
had.</p>

<p>“So much the better. Such a sentiment
does him honor. This circumstance
may lead to a friendship
between them which cannot be too
intimate, in my opinion. And you
say our prodigal son is willing to
work? What is he going to do?”</p>

<p>“Anything you wish, father.”</p>

<p>“That is easily said, but a poor
reply. Nothing is well done that we
do not like to do. Has he manifested
an inclination for any special occupation?”</p>

<p>“Louis is a civil engineer. He
would like to find a place somewhere
in that capacity.”</p>

<p>“Ah! he at length remembers he
is a civil engineer!... He
wishes to turn his acquirements to
some account?... It is a
wonder! He need not exile himself
for that. You know Mr. Smithson?”</p>

<p>“Is not he the cold, ceremonious
gentleman who came to see us Sunday?”</p>

<p>“The very one. Mr. Smithson is
a wealthy Englishman who has been
in France these twenty years. He
came on account of his health. He
settled at first in Paris, where he
married a charming woman&mdash;a Catholic
of no property, but of a good
family. This excellent Mr. Smithson
was so foolish as to speculate too
much at the Bourse some years since,
and his losses were considerable. To
withdraw himself from such a temptation,
he established his residence at
St. M&mdash;&mdash; six months ago. The situation
pleased him, and there was another
inducement: a large paper manufactory
there was offered for sale. He
bought it, hoping not only to find
occupation, and feed his incessant
activity, but to repair the losses of the
last few years. The mill is well situated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and well patronized. Everything
would prove advantageous if
Mr. Smithson were better versed in
the knowledge of machinery. But
though an Englishman, he has not
been through the studies necessary
to enable him to superintend his industrial
project as he ought. Besides
this, he is subject to frequent attacks
of the gout. He has therefore besought
me to find him a man capable
of superintending the mill under his
direction, and even of taking the
whole charge if necessary.”</p>

<p>“So much for Louis’ affairs. What
do you think of the arrangement?
I approved of it without any restriction.
And you, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“I think, mademoiselle,” replied
Victor, “that Providence continues to
treat Louis with parental kindness.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; truly parental! He will
now remain under your influence.
Even in the house he is to enter,
everything will encourage him, I
hope, to persist in his good resolutions.
Mme. Smithson is said to
be a woman of lovely character.
She has a daughter who must be a
prodigy, unless I have been misinformed.
My father, who is very
practical, and but little given to exaggeration,
is enthusiastic in her
praise.”</p>

<p>Victor knowingly smiled at this
last communication.</p>

<p>“You have divined my thoughts,”
said Aline, blushing a little. “Well,
yes: this thought at once occurred to
my mind. I said to myself, if Louis
can find at Mr. Smithson’s not only
an occupation that will enable him
to forget the past, but an affection
that will continue to sustain him in
a better course, I shall consider him
the most fortunate of men. But it is
too soon to speak of that. This dear
brother must first return home, and
be accepted by Mr. Smithson, to
whom my father wrote to-day.”</p>

<p>The next day both these things
took place. Louis returned. Mr.
Smithson at once accepted him as
his assistant. After calling on us
with his father, he left for St. M&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>While M. Beauvais was speaking
to me, Louis said to Victor, in a low
tone:</p>

<p>“Everything is done. The bonds
of iniquity are completely broken.
I have been to confession and to
Holy Communion, and a new life
has begun!”</p>

<p>The air of satisfaction with which
he uttered these words, the calmness
and unaffected gravity he manifested,
all announced he had indeed become
a new man.</p>

<p>“In a year he will be an eminent
Christian!” said Victor, as Louis
disappeared.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c195" name="c195"></a>CONCILIAR DECREES ON THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.</h2>

<p class="pc1">FROM THE ETUDES RELIGIEUSES.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> church has been commissioned
to teach all mankind. It is
by preaching she fulfils this great
work. But to aid her in this divine
mission, her Founder has furnished
her with books written under the inspiration
of the Holy Ghost, which
contain the very word of God graven
in ineffaceable characters. So precious
a treasure has always been preserved
by the church with the respect
it merits. Her doctors have
carefully weighed every word of
these holy books; they have taken
pleasure in developing the different
significations; and their commentaries
form the finest monuments of
Christian literature. There, as in a
well-furnished arsenal, they have
sought spiritual arms in their warfare
against the enemies of the faith, and
they have defended the Bible with
unequalled zeal against all attacks
and alterations by heretics. The
Scriptures have been the object of
the fury of persecutors, and more
than one hero has shed his blood to
defend them from the insults of the
unbeliever, and thereby had his
name inscribed on the glorious roll
of the martyrology.</p>

<p>Protestantism, at its very birth,
was desirous of profiting by this respect
of the Christian world. It affected
an ardent zeal for the sacred
books, and, carrying its veneration
beyond reasonable limits, maintained
that the Bible is the only rule of
faith. But its very exaggerations, by
a law of Providence, have led it to
the opposite extreme. Three centuries
have hardly elapsed, and the followers
of those who acknowledged
no other rule of faith than the Bible,
gradually led to the verge of rationalism,
accord a merely human authority
to the sacred volume.</p>

<p>Even from the very dawn of the
Reformation, the pernicious influence
of free examination gave a deadly
blow to the canon of Scripture. Luther
was the foremost. Everything
in Holy Writ that conflicted with his
doctrines of wholly imputative justification,
of free-will, and the sacraments
was boldly consigned among
the apocryphal books. The canon
of Scripture, thus at the option of
individuals, no longer had any stability.
Individual caprice led to the
admission or rejection of books that
had been regarded as inspired from
all antiquity. The authenticity of
the Scriptures was not only questioned,
but also their legitimate
meaning. Luther denied the doctrinal
authority of the church, and
was obliged to make the Bible the
ground of faith; that is, the Bible interpreted
according to the particular
notions of each believer. In reality,
Luther wished to subject his followers
to his own interpretation. Like
rebels of every age, he arrogated an
authority he refused to legitimate
power. But logic has its inevitable
laws. The Lutheran theory claimed
absolute independence. It made all
Christians, even the most ignorant,
even those the farthest from the
knowledge of the truth, judges of the
real signification of the Scriptures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
It promised each believer the interior
illumination of the Holy Spirit
in ascertaining the true meaning of
the sacred text beneath all its obscurities.
But, as the divine Spirit is
not pledged to fulfil the promises of
the Reformer, each Protestant interprets
the Bible according to his own
views, and the various sects sprung
from the Reform have, in the name
of the Scriptures, maintained the
most contradictory opinions.</p>

<p>Besides the change in the canon,
and the false interpretation of the holy
books, there was another abuse&mdash;that
of unfaithful translations. Protestantism
rejected the authority of
the church, therefore it would not receive
her version of the Scriptures.
It had no regard for the Vulgate.
The innovators, with Luther at their
head, undertook new translations.
In their boldness, they did not shrink
from attempting to surpass the work
of S. Jerome. They were not well
versed in the knowledge of the original
idioms; they had access to but few
manuscripts; the copies they had
were not the choicest; and yet they
imagined they could excel the great
doctor who spent so large a part of
his life in Palestine, absorbed in the
profound study of the ancient languages;
who took pains to collate
the best manuscripts, and was aided
by the ancient rabbis the most versed
in the knowledge of Hebrew antiquities
and in the languages of the
East. Every day a new translation
appeared, which, under the pretext
of adapting God’s own Word to the
common mind, diffused heretical
novelties by means of insidious falsifications.</p>

<p>The Reform was equally unscrupulous
as to the correctness of the
text. The Bible was left to the arbitrariness
of its editors and the carelessness
of printers. Through unscrupulousness
or negligence, many incorrect
expressions crept into the versions
sold to the public. The new heresy
was not wholly responsible for the
numerous faults in the various editions
of the Bible. The sacred book had
for ages been subjected to all the
hazards of individual transcription.
The distractions of the copyist had,
in many instances, caused the substitution
of one word for another, the
omission of a part of a verse, or the
transferring of the marginal gloss to
the text. Hence so many copies alike
in the main, but full of discrepancies.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Such was the state of the Bible
question at the opening of the Council
of Trent. Its importance could
not escape the bishops who composed
that assembly, and the theologians
who assisted them with their acquirements,
consequently it was the first
proposed for consideration. On the
8th of February, 1546, the fathers
being assembled in general congregation,
Cardinal del Monte, the chief
legate of the Holy See, proposed the
council should first consider the
subject of the Holy Scriptures, and
make a recension of the canon, in
order to determine the arms to be
used in the struggle against heresy,
and also to thereby show Catholics
whereon their faith was grounded,
many of whom lived in deplorable
ignorance on this point, seeing the
same book accepted by some as
dictated by the Holy Spirit, and rejected
by others as spurious.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The
president of the council afterwards
determined the principal points to be
submitted to the consideration of the
Fathers.</p>

<p>But this is not the place to review
the account of this interesting discussion.
We will only state the results.</p>

<p>In the fourth session, held April 8,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
1546, the council promulgated its
celebrated decree respecting the
Holy Scriptures, which comprehended
two very distinct parts: the first,
dogmatic; the second, disciplinary.</p>

<p>The dogmatic part established the
authority of the sacred books in
matters of faith and morals, their divine
origin, the canon, the authenticity
of the Vulgate, and the rules
for interpreting the inspired text.</p>

<p>The disciplinary prescriptions had
reference to the use of the Vulgate
in the lessons, sermons, controversies,
and commentaries; the obligation
of interpreting the Scriptures according
to the unanimous teachings of the
Fathers; the respect to be paid to the
divine Word, and, consequently, the
crime of those who apply it to profane,
light, or superstitious uses.
The council likewise enacted severe
laws against publishers who issue the
holy books, or commentaries on
them, without a written authorization
of the ordinary, and against the vendors
or holders of prohibited editions;
finally, it ordained that the Holy
Scriptures, especially the Vulgate, be
henceforth printed with all possible
correctness.</p>

<p>To these prescriptions of the fourth
session we will add the first chapter
of the decree of reform, continued
in the fifth session, ordering the institution
of a course of Holy Scripture
in certain churches, in order that
the Christian community might not
be ignorant of the salutary truths contained
in the sacred volume. Such
was the reply to Protestant calumnies
which accused the church of withholding
the sacred treasure of God’s
Word from the faithful.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, were the labors of
the Council of Trent with regard to
the Holy Scriptures. The importance
of the decree of the fourth session
must not be estimated according
to the brief place it occupies in the
canons, for, brief as it is, it has had
an incalculable influence on sacred
science. This decree, in fact, gave
rise to those admirable works of criticism
that have defended the authentic
canon against the attacks of heresy,
and reduced the pretended discoveries
of Protestantism respecting
the true canon of holy books to their
proper value; thence the number of
excellent commentaries that for three
centuries have been enriching Catholic
theology; and thence so many
apologetic works which have defended
the truth of the Biblical narrative
against the false pretensions of rationalistic
history. To this same decree
we owe the many learned researches
concerning the original text,
the primitive versions regarded as
genuine in the ancient churches, and,
above all, the incomparable edition
of the Vulgate&mdash;the result of thirty
years’ labor by those most versed in
the study of sacred literature.</p>

<p>It would seem as if there were no
necessity of reconsidering a question
so fully weighed by the Council of
Trent. And yet the Fathers of the
Vatican also deemed it proper to take
up the subject of the Holy Scriptures,
in order to reaffirm what had been
defined by the Council of Trent, to
give greater prominence to points
that the council had left obscure,
and to clear up some difficulties of
interpretation that had arisen within
three centuries even among Catholic
schools. The dogmatic part of the
decree of Trent alone was renewed
and completed by the Fathers of the
Vatican. The exclusively doctrinal
character of the decree <i>Dei Filius</i>
admitted no reconsideration of the
disciplinary laws relating to the publishing
of the holy books, or their
commentaries, and the abuses that
might be made of the sacred text.
Besides, the penalties decreed by the
Council of Trent were such as in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
day could not be put in execution, as
they consisted not only of spiritual
censures, but pecuniary fines. The
ecclesiastical authority, deprived of
its ancient tribunals, and living in the
midst of a society whose leading
maxim is liberty of the press and
liberty of conscience, could not revive
the old penalties. The Fathers
of the Vatican also omitted everything
respecting the authenticity of
the Vulgate. Many of them, however,
requested the council to ratify
the decree of the fourth session of
Trent on this point, but the greater
part of the bishops did not deem it
advisable to accede to the request.
What, indeed, could they add to that
which had been so wisely defined by
the Fathers of Trent? Besides, is not
the Vulgate received without protest
by the whole Catholic world as the
only version recognized by the
church as authentic? As to the rationalists,
it is not the translation of
the sacred books they attack, but the
books themselves, their canonicity
and supernatural origin.</p>

<p>Laying aside, therefore, all these
questions so important in themselves,
but which are not now points of controversy,
the Council of the Vatican
only dwelt on the authority of the
Scriptures, their divine origin, the
canon, and the rule of interpretation.
On all these points it had to oppose
modern rationalism, and banish false
and dangerous theories from Catholic
schools of theology.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>First, in opposition to rationalism,
the council teaches that divine revelation
is comprised in the Scriptures
and tradition. This was declared in
the same terms by the Council of
Trent, but it was by no means useless
in these times to renew so fundamental
a definition. Modern science
rejects revelation: to be consistent,
it ought also to reject its
monuments. It regards the Holy
Scriptures as merely of human authority.
It does not, it is true, imitate
the cynicism of the philosophers
of the XVIIIth century: it does not
make our holy books the butt of their
foolish railleries. On the contrary,
it affects a profound respect for them,
though it refuses to accept them as
the organ of divine communications.
It regards them as it would the discourses
of Socrates&mdash;as books full of
admirable wisdom which every philosopher
ought to know and study,
but which do not owe their origin to
inspiration, properly so-called, or to
revelation.</p>

<p>Discussion as to such an error was
impossible. The council had merely
to pass its judgment, and repeat what
the church had taught its members
for eighteen centuries, as a fresh
proof that the Christian faith does
not falter in encountering the many
new forms of incredulity. Having
affirmed the truth of revelation, it
was necessary to point out what it
was contained in, that the Christian
might know where to study the
science of salvation. It says:
“This supernatural revelation, according
to the belief of the universal
church, as declared by the holy
Council of Trent, is contained in the
written books and in the unwritten
traditions that have come down to
us.”</p>

<p>But what books contain this revelation?
Pursuing the subject, the
council defined anew the canon of
Scripture, which the state of the
times made, if not necessary, at least
very opportune. Protestant critics
have not ceased since the Reformation
to attack the canon sanctioned
by the authority of the church. Rationalism
has come to the support
of Protestant criticism, and sometimes
flatters itself it has, by its historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
discoveries, blotted out the
entire list of the holy books. The unadulterated
traditions preserved by
the church have no scientific value
in the eyes of rationalism, which only
admits the canonicity of those books
that can trace the proofs of their origin
back to the very time of the
apostles. Tertullian took a wrong
stand in asserting that the dogmas
of faith should have prescriptive
proof. In vain the Catholic points
out the wholly exceptional circumstances
that surround the Scriptural
canon&mdash;the impossibility from the
very first of admitting books of
doubtful origin as coming from the
apostles, or that these books could
have been changed in any respect
under the jealous guardianship of a
church and hierarchy spread over
the face of the earth, and charged
with the conservation of the sacred
deposit. The incredulous critic refuses
to receive proofs which the
most common mind perceives the
full value of as well as the good
sense. What does he substitute for
them? Theories founded on mere
conjecture, and constantly changing,
but which are welcomed as the final
conclusions of science. Have we
not seen the school of Tübingen
found on some obscure words of Papias
a whole system tending to establish
the more recent composition of the
Gospels? These new doctors regard
the books of divine truth as some of
those legends that are embellished as
they pass from mouth to mouth till
they are collected in a definite form
by some unknown writer. And has
not this strange theory met with ardent
panegyrists in France, as if it were
the definite solution of the great controversy
on the origin of the Gospels?<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Whoever attentively examines these
strange theories will soon perceive
their weak point. But where are the
men in the present generation who
read with sufficient care to see the
hollowness of such solutions? Their
authors have seats in our academies;
they occupy the most important
professorships; there is not an honorary
distinction that does not add its
recommendation to their apparent
knowledge. Skilled in praising one
another, the journals and reviews regarded
as authorities, even by certain
Catholics, extol their labors.
One would think they had a monopoly
of science. Has not all this been
a source of real danger to the faith
of Christians?</p>

<p>The church had to counteract the
influence of a criticism as bold as it
was easy, by her immutable decrees.
It must once more affirm the ancient
canon of Scripture. This catalogue
of the sacred books had been solemnly
approved at the end of the IVth
century, in a celebrated decree of the
Councils of Hippo and Carthage, in
which the Fathers declared they received
this canon from their ancestors
in the faith. A little later, Pope S.
Innocent I. sent this same canon of
Scripture to S. Exuperius, the illustrious
Bishop of Toulouse. S. Gelasius,
in 494, included it in his synodical
decree. Finally, the Council of
Florence, in its decree relating to the
Jacobites, and, at a later period, the
Council of Trent, sanctioned it by
their supreme authority. Several of
the Fathers of Trent proposed to subject
it to a re-examination; not in
order to retrench anything, but to
satisfy the heretical, and convince
them by such a discussion that the
Church of Rome had not lightly decided
on the list of the inspired books.
But a large majority of the Fathers
thought, and with reason, that such a
discussion was appropriate to schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of Catholic theology, but to a council
it belonged to pronounce authoritatively.
The canon of Scripture,
being a dogma of faith, formally defined
by popes and councils, and
consequently unchangeable, could
only be proclaimed anew and without
discussion.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The Council of the
Vatican came to a like decision, and,
in declaring its acceptance of the
canon of the Council of Trent, with
each of its books, in all the parts, it
strengthened the faith of Christians
against the shameful pretensions of
false science.</p>

<p>This course has shocked the Protestant
historian of the council. M.
de Pressensé is indignant at so summary
a procedure. “The council,”
he says, “has fallen into a profound
and dangerous error on two important
points. In the first place, it proclaims
the indisputable canonicity of
all the books of the Vulgate, including
the Apocrypha<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of the Old Testament,
thus showing it regards the
immense labors of the critics of the
XIXth century as of no account, and
acknowledging that it is not permitted,
for example, to question the origin of
the Gospel of Matthew, or the author
of the Epistle to the Hebrews, by referring
to such and such an expression
of a Father of the IId and IIId
centuries.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>The Catholic Church is
thus prevented anew from taking any
part in the great work of Christian
science of our day, which consists in
establishing a safeguard to the true
canon of Holy Scripture by free and
conscientious research. What confidence
can we have in Catholic theology,
on those points disputed by
rationalism, like the authenticity of
the fourth Gospel? Examination,
even, is forbidden. Everything must
be accepted in a lump. How much
valuable co-operation is thus lost or
made fruitless through the council!”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The church, then, at the bidding
of this Protestant theologian, should
renounce her right to decide on the
true Scriptures, and give up the
canon to the researches of rationalistic
science, and this in order to provide
a safeguard for this same canon.
An amusing idea, to give up the
catalogue of holy books to the
caprice of incredulous critics in order
to preserve it intact! And besides,
what new documents can rationalistic
science bring to light not perfectly
known and considered by the Catholic
theologians of the last three centuries?
Catholic doctors have seen
and weighed these difficulties as fully,
to say the least, as Protestant critics,
but they have not thought a few obscurities
ought, scientifically, to outweigh
immemorial prescription, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
dogmatically, the perpetual usage of
the church and the decrees of councils.</p>

<p>Rationalism, on the contrary, appeals
to obscure passages, or hasty conclusions
sometimes to be met with in
the Fathers, in order to exclude books
from the Scriptural canon that have
been venerated from time immemorial
as inspired. On which side is the
real scientific method? If historical
records merit any confidence in spite
of difficulties of detail, no person of
sincerity would hesitate to give the
preference to the theological rather
than the rationalistic method.</p>

<p>As to the reproach made against
the church for confining criticism
within such narrow limits as to stifle
it, nothing is more contrary to experience.
The Council of Trent likewise
decided on the canon of Scripture,
and yet what extensive labors,
how many learned works, have been
published within three centuries in
reply to the attacks of Protestantism,
and in order to establish the authenticity
of the books rejected by the
Reformer! No, indeed; the church,
in defining the canon of Scripture,
does not discourage the researches
of the learned respecting the Bible.
The love of sacred literature, in the
first place, and also the necessity of
defending Catholic belief against the
constantly renewed attacks of heterodox
criticism, will keep Catholic
apologists constantly at work. The
church, in maintaining its canon, directs
their labors, but without putting
any restraint on their abilities.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Besides reaffirming the ancient decrees
relating to the canon of Scripture,
the Council of the Vatican has
completed and explained more clearly
what faith requires us to believe respecting
the origin of the holy books.
This point had not been fully decided.
The wants of the times had not before
required it. But the attacks of
rationalism, and the misinterpretations
of semi-rationalism, required a
more definite decision in order to put
an end to dangerous teachings even
in Catholic schools.</p>

<p>Christians have from the beginning
believed God to be the author of the
Holy Scriptures. The Fathers of the
fourth Council of Carthage, in the
profession of faith required of the
new bishops, expressly made mention
of this truth. The same profession
of faith is made in our day by
those who are promoted to the episcopate.
Pope S. Leo IX., in the
profession of faith to which he required
Peter of Antioch to subscribe,
declared God to be the author of the
Old and New Testaments, including
the law, the prophets, and the apostolic
books. The Council of Florence
inserted this same article in the decree
about the Jacobites: The most
holy Roman Church “confesses that
it is one and the same God who is
the author of the Old and the New
Testament; that is to say, the law,
the prophets, and the Gospel; the
saints of both Testaments having
spoken under the inspiration of the
same Holy Spirit.” Finally, the
Council of Trent, renewing the decree
of Florence, accepted all the
canonical books of the two Testaments,
God being the author of
them both: <i>Cum utriusque unus Deus
sit auctor</i>. Besides, all these decrees
were only an expansion of the words
of the Nicene Creed: <i>Qui locutus est
per prophetas</i>.</p>

<p>The Catholic dogma is explicit:
“God is the author of the books of
the Old and the New Testament.”
The definitions of the ancient councils
had for their direct object the
condemnation of the errors of the
Manichees, who made a distinction
between the two Testaments, attributing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the first to the evil principle,
the second to the true God. But,
secondarily, these definitions, referring
to the actual origin of the Holy
Scriptures, declare they have God
for their author. The Council of
Florence gave this explanation: “Because
the saints of both Testaments
wrote under the inspiration of the
same Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p>But what is meant by inspiration?
An important question, on which not
only Protestants differ from Catholics,
but on which even orthodox
writers are not agreed.</p>

<p>To say what Protestantism understands
by the inspiration of the
Scriptures would be difficult, or, to
speak more correctly, impossible.
In a system where all belief is founded
on free examination, there must
be an infinite variety of doctrinal
opinions. The first Reformers understood
the inspiration of the holy
books in the strictest sense&mdash;every
word of Scripture was sacred. Now,
Protestantism, even the most orthodox,
allows greater latitude. Constrained
to make more or less concession
to the encroaching spirit of
rationalism, it takes refuge in vague
expressions that leave one in doubt
as to the part God had in the composition
of the sacred books. Here
is a pastor who considers himself orthodox,
and boasts of remaining
faithful to the principles of Luther
and Calvin; he enters upon the subject
of the Scriptures, and speaks at
length on the inspiration of the Holy
Ghost. Nevertheless, in these holy
books inspired by God, he admits
the possibility of complete error when
there is any question of history or
science which does not touch directly
on religious dogmas or precepts.
Even in what relates to religious
truth, inspiration, to him, is reduced
to I know not what particular
assistance granted those who had
witnessed the life of Christ, in relating
what they had seen and heard.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>According to this theory, every
way so vague, we ask ourselves, What
was the nature of the inspiration imparted
to the Evangelists SS. Mark
and Luke, who were not witnesses
of our Saviour’s deeds, but merely related
what they had heard from
others; what was the nature of that
imparted to S. Paul, who had never
seen Christ, and took something very
different for the subject of his epistles
from the acts and discourses of the
Redeemer?</p>

<p>The incertitudes of Protestantism
had pervaded more than one Catholic
school, especially in Germany.
Jahn, in his introduction to the
books of the Old Testament, confounds
inspiration with assistance.
A book composed by the mere light
of reason and pure human industry
might be placed on the catalogue of
Holy Writ, if the church declared
God had preserved the writer from
all error in the composition of the
work. Who does not see the falseness
of a system which would include
all the dogmatic decrees of the popes
and councils in the canon of Scripture?
Others confound inspiration
with revealed truth. Every book
written according to the precise spirit
of divine revelation could be placed
in the canon. According to this,
not only the definitions of popes and
councils, but many ascetic works,
sermons, and catechisms, might be
reckoned among the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>Finally, others, desirous of explaining
the difference to be seen in the
various books of the Bible, think several
kinds of inspiration are to be
distinguished. Sometimes the truths
the sacred writer had to record were
above human comprehension, or at
least unknown to him, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
only be learned by actual revelation.
The inspiration God accords for this
class of truths supersedes all effort
on the part of the writer. It is a
suggestive inspiration, or, as it is
called, <i>antecedent</i>.</p>

<p>If the sacred writer was himself
aware of the facts he related, and the
philosophical maxims he proposed to
insert in his book, or if he had drawn
from any other source the truths he
undertook to record, he had no
need of suggestive inspiration. His
book, however, is to be regarded as
the work of God if he received special
assistance to guide him in the
choice of the truths he recorded, and
prevent him from making any mistake
in expressing himself. This is
what is called <i>concomitant</i> inspiration.</p>

<p>Finally, suppose a work composed
by mere human wisdom, without any
other participation on the part of
God than general assistance, and it
comes to pass that God, by the testimony
of his prophets, or the voice
of the church, declares this book exempt
from error, it is thereby endowed
with infallible authority, and
may be reckoned among the Scriptures.
This kind of approval has
been styled, though very improperly,
<i>subsequent</i> inspiration.</p>

<p>These three distinct kinds of inspiration
have been taught by eminent
theologians, such as Sixtus of Sienna
(<i>Biblioth. Sac.</i> l. viii. Hæres, 12
ad. obj. sept.), Bonfrère (<i>Proloq.</i> c.
viii.), Lessius and Hamel (<i>Hist.
Congreg. de Auxiliis</i>, a Livino de
Meyere, l. i. c. ix.). But these doctors
never actually applied this distinction
to the books that compose the canon
of Scripture. It was for them a mere
question of possibility: could books
thus authentically approved have a
place in the Scriptural canon? They
replied in the affirmative. But are
there actually any of our holy books
that are wholly due to human industry,
and which God has declared sacred
by subsequent approval? We
give Lessius’ opinion: “Though I
do not believe this kind of inspiration
produced any of our canonical
books, I do not think it impossible”
(<i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>

<p>But the wise reserve of these great
theologians has not been imitated by
all. A learned German professor,
who is likewise a highly esteemed
author, has not hesitated to apply
the distinction of these three kinds
of inspiration to the existing books:
“The kind of inspiration,” he says,
“that produced such and such a
book, or such and such a passage,
it is almost impossible to determine
in particular. We can only
say that the parts where we read,
<i>Thus saith the Lord</i>, or a similar formula,
probably belong to the first
kind of inspiration; the historical
narrations that came under the writer’s
observation belong to the third
(subsequent inspiration); the poetical
books seem to come under the
second (concomitant inspiration).”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>These systems, it is manifest,
weaken one’s idea of the inspiration
of the sacred volume as always understood
by the church. We want
an inspiration by virtue of which the
book is really the work of God, and
not of man&mdash;the truths it contains of
divine, and not of human, origin:
man is the instrument, he who dictates
is the Holy Ghost: man lends
his hand and pen, the Spirit of truth
puts them in action. But in the systems
referred to, it is not really God
who speaks: it is man. Supernatural
testimony gives indeed a divine
authority to a book, but it could not
make God the author of what was
really composed by man. And
though these writings should contain
the exact truths of revelation, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
would be as much the result of human
wisdom as sermons, catechisms, ascetic
books, and even the creeds and
decrees of councils which clearly
state the doctrines of the church.</p>

<p>It was the duty of the council to
put an end to interpretations which,
depriving the sacred books of the
prestige of divine origin, diminished
their authority among the faithful.
It has therefore defined what every
Catholic must believe concerning
the degree of inspiration accorded
to the sacred writers. This definition
is first stated in a negative form:
“The church holds them (the Holy
Scriptures) as sacred and canonical,
not for the reason that they have
been compiled by mere human industry,
and afterwards approved by
her authority; nor only because they
contain revelation without error.”
To this definition in a negative form
succeeds a positive one, in which the
council declares the essential condition
of a book’s being placed in the
canon of Scripture&mdash;“because, having
been written under the inspiration
of the Holy Ghost, they have God
for their author”: <i>propterea quod Spiritu
Sancto inspirante conscripti, Deum
habent auctorem</i>.</p>

<p>The council, therefore, by this dogmatic
definition, has excluded any
other meaning to the inspiration of
the Scriptures that does not ascribe
them to the special agency of God.
The schools are still free to discuss
what this divine operation consists in,
and the conditions on which a book
may be said to have God for its author.
But they must first reject
every explanation that reduces the
agency of God to mere assistance,
and, still more, to subsequent approbation.
It is in this sense we must
understand the fourth canon of the
second series: “If any one shall refuse
to receive for sacred and canonical
the books of the Holy Scriptures
in their integrity, with all their parts,
according as they were enumerated
by the Holy Council of Trent, or
shall deny that they are inspired by
God, let him be anathema.” It is
the same anathema pronounced by
the Council of Trent, to which the
Council of the Vatican has added the
express mention of the inspiration of
the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>There are other important observations
to be made concerning this
definition. Though by no means
favorable to the system of Sixtus of
Sienna, Bonfrère, and Lessius, it does
not, however, condemn them in formal
terms. These theologians, as we
have said, only considered the subject
<i>in abstracto</i>: Would subsequent inspiration
or approbation give a book a
right to be placed in the canon?&mdash;a
verbal question rather than one of
doctrine. It is certain that such a
book would have a sacred authority,
but it is also certain that it could not
be called the work of God in the
same sense as the holy books now in
our possession. The council, in its
definition, only considered the actual
point; it declared all the books of
our canon have God for their author,
because the Holy Ghost was the
chief agent in their composition.
But the opinion of the modern exegete
who applies the doctrine of subsequent
approbation to the books contained
in our actual canon appears
to us really condemned by the new
definition.</p>

<p>Now, the decree of the Vatican
does not forbid the division of the
holy books into several classes according
as the truths they contain
are recorded by the writer as a special
revelation, or from knowledge acquired
by his natural faculties. But this
distinction does not infringe on the
overruling agency of God in the
composition of the book.</p>

<p>Finally, the question of verbal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
inspiration, so often discussed by
theologians, remains as free since the
council as before. It is not necessary
for a ruler who issues a decree to
dictate every expression, but merely
the substance of the new law: the
secretary clothes it in his own style.
The latter is not a mere copyist: he,
too, is the author of the decree, but in
a secondary sense. It is the same
with regard to the Holy Scriptures.
The Holy Spirit suggests the truths
to be recorded in the prophecy, and
directs the writer, but David and
Isaias clothe them in their own royal
style, Amos in his rustic language.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>We come now to the question of
the interpretation of the holy books.
On this point, also, the Council of the
Vatican has renewed and completed
the decree of the Council of Trent,
which, in its fourth session, endeavored
to check the boldness, or, to
make use of its own expression, the
restlessness of the free-thinkers of
the age. Protestants are constantly
appealing to the Scriptures, but to
the Scriptures according to private
interpretation. Agreed merely in
their opposition to the church and
its doctrines, they are divided infinitely
as to the signification of the
simplest texts. The strangest interpretations
are daily astonishing the
faith of the believer, and giving rise
to scandals among Christians. To
obviate this abuse, the Council of
Trent made the following decree:
“In order to restrain restless spirits,
the council decrees that no one, relying
on his own wisdom in matters
of faith and morals pertaining to the
edification of the Christian doctrine,
shall wrest the Holy Scripture according
to his own private notions,
and have the boldness to interpret it
contrary to the true sense in which
it has been and is held by our holy
mother, the church, to whom it belongs
to judge of the interpretation
of the Holy Scriptures, or contrary
to the unanimous consent of the
Fathers.”</p>

<p>This decree, as to its form, is chiefly
disciplinary: it prohibits interpreting
the Scriptures contrary to the definition
of the church and the unanimous
opinion of the Fathers in all
that relates to faith and morals.</p>

<p>This disciplinary prescription is
based on a dogmatic principle which
the Council of Trent did not define,
but which it referred to as an incontestable
truth: to wit, that to the
church it belongs to judge of the
true meaning of the Scriptures:
<i>cujus est judicare de vero sensu et interpretatione
Scripturarum sanctarum</i>.
This truth is the necessary consequence
of the supreme magistracy of
the faith. All Catholics venerate
the church as the depository of revealed
truth, and consequently of
the Scriptures. But the deposit is
not merely a material one. The
Christian receives the Scriptures from
her, first, because it is by her testimony
he is assured of the true
canon, that they have God for their
author, and that he is enabled to distinguish
the real text from the inaccuracies
that have, in the course of
time, been introduced by the carelessness
of copyists, as well as the
unscrupulousness of heretics. Moreover,
he receives them from the
church, because through her he is
made aware of their true meaning.
What would it avail him to possess
the inspired volume, if, like the book
in the Apocalypse, it were sealed
with seven seals? And who has the
power to break these seals but the
church&mdash;bride of the Lamb?</p>

<p>In vain Protestantism repeats that
the Scriptures are plain in themselves,
or, at least, that the interior
illumination of the Holy Spirit renders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
them intelligible to all. If this
is really the case, why, whenever the
voice of the church is unheeded, the
infinite number of ways of interpreting
the same passages? How was
it that Calvin plainly saw a mere
figure of the Presence in the passage
relating to the Eucharist, when Luther
clearly understood it to mean
the Real Presence? Would the
Holy Spirit speak to Luther in one
way, and to Calvin in another entirely
opposite? Whatever the Reformers
may say, the Scriptures are
full of obscurity. The truths of salvation
they contain are not expressed
in the didactic manner of a
theological treatise. The truths are
there, but veiled in mystery, expressed
in a language now dead, and
full of allusions to a history and to
customs widely differing from ours, as
well as to the institutions and local
circumstances of a nation no longer
existing. Private research would, no
doubt, enable a small number of men
of intelligence and learning to comprehend
many parts of our holy
books; but this means is not accessible
to the masses, who would remain
for ever deprived of the truths contained
in the Scriptures if there were
not on earth an authorized interpreter
of the divine text. What certitude
would the learned themselves
have on this point without the help
of the church? How many divergent
opinions would not liberty of
interpretation produce! It was,
therefore, necessary that the church,
when entrusted with the Scriptures,
should at the same time receive
power to interpret them authentically.
This is why the Council of Trent forbids
interpreting them contrary to
the defined meaning of the church.</p>

<p>Now, the church acquits itself of
its duties as interpreter in two ways:
by solemn definitions, and by the ordinary
teachings of its doctors. The
definitions of the church are not, in
fact, restricted to the declaration of
dogmatic decisions: they often decide
the real meaning of the Scriptures.
Thus we see the Council of
Trent is not satisfied with defining
the divine institution and existence
of the sacrament of Extreme Unction:
it also declares that the well-known
words of the Apostle S. James
refer to this sacrament, and designate
its ministry, its matter, its form,
and its effects.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In like manner,
with regard to the sacrament of
Penance, not content with defining
its existence, it declares, in the first
chapter of the fourteenth session,
that our Lord referred to this sacrament
when, addressing his disciples,
he said: <i>Quorum remiseritis peccata</i>.
We could point out many other passages
of Scripture of a similar nature
which the Council of Trent and
other councils have authentically defined
the meaning of.</p>

<p>But the interpretation of the sacred
text is more frequently shown
by the usage of the church, especially
in its liturgy, and by the unanimous
or almost unanimous teachings
of the Fathers and doctors. It was
thus the meaning of the passages
concerning the Eucharist were clearly
determined by the liturgy, the writings
of the Fathers, the teachings of
the schools, and the general sentiment
of the Christian world a long
time before it was expressly defined
by the Council of Trent. In the
same way, the church did not wait
for the definition of the Council of
the Vatican to regard the promises
of Christ to S. Peter as made to the
See of Rome, and including the essential
prerogatives of the Pontifical
power.</p>

<p>Such was the twofold manner of
defining the meaning of the Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the Council of Trent had in
view when it forbade their interpretation
on points of faith and morals
contrary to the sense in which
they are held by holy church and
the unanimous consent of the Fathers.</p>

<p>This decree appears sufficiently explicit.
And yet semi-rationalism
found two ways of eluding its bearing.
The first was to regard this
part of the decree of the fourth session
as purely disciplinary, doubtless
necessary in the condition of Christendom
at the time of the Council of
Trent, but susceptible of being afterwards
modified. Now, in our day,
the Catholic faith is no longer attacked
as it once was through the authority
of the Scriptures. Knowledge
has increased. The commentator is
forced to be mindful of the progress
of human intelligence, and to reconcile
the meaning of the Scriptures
with the discoveries of the age. If
one persists in asserting that the decree
of the council relates to faith
as well as discipline, semi-rationalism
has recourse to another evasion: it
understands this decree merely in a
negative sense; namely, that it is not
lawful to interpret the Scriptures
contrary to the Catholic belief, which
does not imply any obligation to regard
the meaning the church attaches
to a passage of Scripture as an
article of faith. According to this
rule, the Catholic theologian could
not interpret any text in opposition
to the existence of the sacrament of
Extreme Unction, but, notwithstanding
the declarations of the Council
of Trent, he would remain within the
bounds of orthodoxy, even if he denied
that the words of S. James had
any reference to this sacrament.</p>

<p>Such is the half-way manner in
which unsubmissive souls flatter
themselves they can remain true to
the faith without accepting the teachings
of the church. For a long time
this doctrine was practically followed,
though not formally stated. We will
give an example. In the XVIIth
century, the Oratorian, Richard Simon,
carried the boldness of his criticisms
to such an extreme that he
openly acknowledged he made no
account of traditional interpretation,
the authority of the Fathers, and the
teachings of the church; pretending
to correct, according to the Hebrew
or Greek text, the meaning constantly
followed by the doctors of the
church. Our readers are well aware
with what vigor Bossuet attacked a
system so thoroughly Protestant.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>But this way of understanding the
decree of the Council of Trent was
in direct opposition to the terms in
which it is conceived. The form
doubtless is disciplinary, but the
foundation of this law is expressly
stated, and is wholly dogmatic:
<i>Cujus (ecclesiæ) est judicare de vero
sensu et interpretatione Scripturarum
sanctarum</i>. This was not a mere
disciplinary prescript made for the
first time by the council, but the reminder
of an obligation imposed on
all Christians by the very nature of
revelation and the authority of the
church.</p>

<p>If it is not true that this decree is
purely disciplinary, it is still less so
that it should be understood in a
mere negative sense, as if the council
only intended forbidding the interpretation
of the Scriptures contrary to
the express dogmas or even the
definitions of the church and the
unanimous opinion of the Fathers.
The principle on which this decree is
founded goes still further: “It is to
the church it belongs to judge of the
true sense and interpretation of the
Holy Scriptures.” Consequently, we
ought not only to refrain from contradicting
her authentic interpretation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
but should regard her as our guide,
and her decision in matters of interpretation
as binding on every Christian,
so that he would fall into heresy
who should refuse to accept the
meaning of a passage of Scripture as
defined by holy church. Such is
the evident meaning of the decree
of the Council of Trent.</p>

<p>This truth is so manifest that the
profession of faith by Pius IV. substitutes
the positive and general form
for the negative and restrictive terms
of the decree: “I also admit the
Holy Scriptures according to that
sense which our Holy Mother the
church hath held and doth hold, to
whom it belongeth to judge of the
true sense and interpretation of the
Scriptures; neither will I ever take
and interpret them otherwise than
according to the unanimous consent
of the Fathers.” Here the teachings
of the church and the opinions of
the Fathers are plainly made the
positive and authentic rule of interpretation.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt as to the
meaning of the Fathers of Trent.
But a controversy having arisen on
a point of so much importance, the
Fathers of the Vatican were forced
to explain this decree in such a way
as to prevent any ambiguity. They
did so in these terms: “And since
those things which the Council of
Trent has declared by wholesome
decree concerning the interpretation
of the Holy Scriptures, in order to restrain
restless spirits, are explained
by some in a wrong sense; we, renewing
the same decree, declare this
to be the mind of the synod: that, in
matters of faith and morals which
pertain to the edification of Christian
doctrine, that is to be held as the
true sense of the sacred Scripture
which Holy Mother Church, to whom
it belongs to judge of the true sense
and interpretation of the sacred
Scriptures, has held and holds: and
therefore that no one may interpret
the sacred Scripture contrary to this
sense or contrary to the unanimous
consent of the Fathers.”</p>

<p>It follows from the definition of
the Vatican that the decree of the
Council of Trent was not purely disciplinary,
but likewise dogmatic:
that consequently it was not intended
for a particular epoch and exceptional
circumstances, but was the expression
of a divine law applicable to
every age, and as lasting as the
church and the world; that this
decree not only forbids understanding
the Scriptures contrary to the
belief and interpretation of the
church, but makes it a positive obligation
to accept the meaning the
church attaches to the sacred text;
in short, that the disciplinary law is
founded on a dogmatic truth which
makes the authentic interpretation
of the church a rule of faith to which
every mind should submit in the
study of Holy Writ.</p>

<p>It is thus the Council of the Vatican
has renewed, explained, and
completed the definitions of the
Council of Trent touching the great
question of the Scriptures. The
second chapter of the Constitution
<i>Dei Filius</i>, in addition to the decree
of the fourth session of the Council
of Trent, henceforth forms the basis
of theological teachings in everything
relating to Biblical science.</p>

<p class="pind">This bald, unjointed chat of his, my lord, I answered indirectly&mdash;<i>Shakespeare, Henry IV.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Authors</span> are proverbially not the
best judges of their own works. It
is as rare, therefore, as it is gratifying
to meet with one whose verdict on
his own production exactly coincides
with that of the critic. Such a fortunate
concurrence of opinion between
the writer and the person to whose
lot it has fallen to pass sentence on a
work for a certain portion of the public,
relieves the latter gentleman of a
vast amount of responsibility, and
renders his difficult task infinitely
lighter and more pleasant than such
a task generally proves to be.</p>

<p>When, then, Mr. Fiske, the author
of <i>Myths and Myth-Makers</i>, is kind
enough gratuitously to inform us in
his preface that the “series of papers”
of which his book is composed
is “somewhat rambling and unsystematic,”
it can be considered no injustice
to him, and no presumption
on our part, to say that we cordially
agree with him. And when he further
informs us that, “in order to
avoid confusing the reader with intricate
discussions, he has sometimes
cut the matter short by expressing
himself with dogmatic definiteness
where a sceptical vagueness might
perhaps have been more becoming,”
we find nothing whatever to object
to in this statement, with the solitary
exception of the word “perhaps,”
which, if suppressed, would bring it
nearer the exact truth.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Fiske has here furnished
us with a very fair idea,
of what the reader is to expect
from his <i>Myths</i>. He himself has
passed sentence on himself. He
tells us practically that we must
not expect too much from his
“rambling” papers; he forestalls, if
he does not deprecate, criticism by
assuring us at the outstart that his
fault has not been on the side of
modesty of opinion and judicial
weighing of what he set forth. What,
then, is left for the critic to do but to
confirm the self-condemnation of the
author?</p>

<p>But we cannot allow Mr. Fiske to
escape us in this fashion. Mr. Fiske
is an M.A., and Mr. Fiske is an LL.B.,
and a professor, and a professor of
philosophy&mdash;at Harvard, too. So
that, although the dates so carefully
affixed to the end of each of his
“rambling and unsystematic” papers
indicate that Mr. Fiske knocked this
book off in three months, still three
months of philosophic chaff from a
Harvard professor ought surely to
contain some grains of wheat.</p>

<p>The book in itself is not an uninteresting
one. It is chock-full of
mythical stories, or folk-lore, or whatever
people may please to call what in
our younger days we should have comprised
under the one delicious head
of fairy-tales. To be sure, the stories
were all told before and by somebody
else; but then, Mr. Fiske gives
everybody due credit, and confines
his own portion of the work to a running
commentary with an undercurrent
of foot-notes, and all sorts of quotations,
from the Rig-Veda down to
Jack and Jill. We cannot in justice
say that Mr. Fiske’s portion is as interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
as the myths themselves,
though partaking considerably of
their character.</p>

<p>But to come to the point&mdash;what
does Mr. Fiske mean by his book?
What idea would he convey to us?
What would he have us infer from
it? “A book’s a book, although
there’s nothing in’t.”</p>

<p>If it is suggestive of anything at
all, it is this: all or the chief portion
of the great myths of antiquity refer
to the struggle between darkness and
light. It was the phenomenon of
night and day which puzzled people
in the dawn of the world, ages before
men possessed the great blessing of
this XIXth century, which blessing
is, according to Mr. Fiske, <i>via</i> M.
Littré, “scientific faith,” seemingly
the only sure thing in this enlightened
age.</p>

<p>Some people might require a definition
of this wonderful faith of
modern invention; but then, some
people always will ask disagreeable
questions. For their benefit, it may
be said to mean taking nothing for
fact or truth except what you can
arrive at, or prove, or demonstrate by
a scientific process: in plain English,
no faith at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Fiske then takes up this theory:
that all men, being puzzled by
this daily phenomenon of light and
darkness, day and night, and having
no “scientific faith” to guide them,
and nothing better (Mr. Fiske will
pardon us this little bit of heresy
against the XIXth century) to supply
its place, set to thinking and endeavoring
to solve this tremendous
problem. They were all a dreadful
sort of people all the world over:
they “knew nothing about laws of nature,
nothing about physical forces,
nothing about the relations of cause
and effect, nothing about the necessary
regularity of things.” As a
set-off against all these “nothings,”
they possessed a something in the
shape of “an unlimited capacity for
believing and fancying, because fancy
and belief had not yet been
checked and headed off in various
directions by established rules of experience.”
To all of which, and a
great deal more of the same nature,
we feel very much inclined to append
that awkward <i>Q. E. D.</i> of the geometry
which somebody would tag
on to the end of those beautiful propositions
at school, and which our
professor terrified us by translating,
“Which must be proved.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fiske, then, having set this
profound and eternal conundrum before
the crazed intellects of the human
race, which were gifted, according
to him, with nothing but this
“unlimited capacity for believing
and fancying”&mdash;one would imagine
that there might have been room for
Revelation here; but Revelation, of
course, clashes with “scientific faith,”
and is therefore a myth in Mr. Fiske’s
eyes&mdash;what were the poor beings to
do but endow everything, particularly
the sun, with the “volition”
which they felt within themselves?
How or why this <i>must</i> have been so
Mr. Fiske fails to explain, or indeed
that it was so at all. However, just
for argument’s sake, let us take his
word for it, though by so doing we
are false to scientific faith. Mr.
Fiske’s proposition, then, runs thus:
Given the sun, and given the people
with eyes to gaze at the sun, the people
must necessarily have endowed
the sun with “volition,” and worshipped
the sun as a god. Once
more, <i>Q. E. D.</i></p>

<p>Hence Mr. Fiske proceeds to argue:
“The conception of infallible skill
in archery, which underlies such a
great variety of myths and popular
fairy-tales, is originally derived from
the inevitable victory of the sun over
his enemies, the demons of night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
winter, and tempest. Arrows and
spears which never miss their mark,
swords from whose blow no armor
can protect, are invariably the weapons
of solar divinities or heroes.”
Consequently, Mr. Fiske is cruel
enough to knock on the head a considerable
number of fictitious characters
who were much better known
and loved by us years ago than
many real characters to-day. He
levels his shaft tipped with scientific
faith, whiz!&mdash;and down drop William
Tell, William of Cloudeslee, Beth-Gellert,
Jack and the Beanstalk, Roland,
Sir Bedivere, Ulysses, Achilles,
Balder the Beautiful, Hercules, and
a whole host of other famous heroes&mdash;or
rather they mount, for one and all
represented the sun, and were types
and figures of his solar majesty.</p>

<p>Well, though we grieve to say it,
it may be so; but the consolation is
still left us that, even if it be so, “it’s
of no consequence,” as our old friend
Mr. Toots was wont sagaciously to
remark. There is so much of reality
around us, and so much real sham,
to speak a paradox, to wing with
our arrows, to shoot at all our lifelong
and make no visible impression
on, that we have neither time, nor
inclination, nor patience to bother
our brains with wire-drawn theories
as to whether Tell was Tell or the
sun; whether a man ever performed
the impossible feat of piercing an
apple, which happened to be on his
boy’s head, with a shaft or not, or
whether a dog was killed by its master
in mistake. Such things may
serve to amuse children or people
who can find nothing better to occupy
their time. So far there is nothing
to object to in it. But when a
man takes every imaginable story,
collects them all as he would old
fossils, and tickets each off with a
bad explanation, or throws them together
into a bag, as it were, and,
charlatan-like, shakes them all up in
order to see if by any chance they
might tumble out in a shape antagonistic
to Christianity, a work which,
in view of the many realities around
us, is rubbish at the best, becomes in
Mr. Fiske’s hands rubbish at the
worst.</p>

<p>For he does not hold to his tether;
he will go out of his way to drag religion
into a place where, if it must
enter, it shows itself, as always, full
of majesty, and beauty, and sublime
truth, but not a thing of ridicule, as
this writer, by hint, and innuendo, and
insinuating little foot-note, and sly
little chuckle, and weak little laugh,
and wit of the very smallest, would
make it.</p>

<p>“The religious myths of antiquity,
and the fireside legends of ancient
and modern times, have their common
roots in the mental habits of primeval
humanity. They are the earliest recorded
utterances of men concerning
the visible phenomena of the world
into which they were born.”</p>

<p>Now, there is nothing particularly
startling in this passage; it is just
such an one as the reader might or
might not assent to, being really utterly
careless on the subject. He
would scarcely stop to inquire how
far Mr. Fiske’s “religious myths of
antiquity” extended. There is a
seemingly unconscious vagueness
about the phrase that allows it to
pass without question. And Mr.
Fiske’s theories, if we may dignify
them by such a title, run on smoothly
enough in killing Beth-Gellert for the
thousandth time, and bringing his
powerful mind and the infallible test
of his “scientific faith” to bear on
old nursery jingles&mdash;such, for instance,
as:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Jack and Jill went up the hill<br />
To get a pail of water;</p>
<p class="pp6i">Jack fell down and broke his crown,<br />
And Jill came tumbling after.”</p>

<p class="p1">“This may read like mere nonsense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>”
says Mr. Fiske. Again we
agree with him it may; but the rising
smile fades on the lip when met
by the solemn assurance immediately
following: “But there is a point of
view from which it may be safely said
that there is very little absolute nonsense
in the world.”</p>

<p>We grieve to say that the thought
which struck us immediately on reading
this aphorism of Mr. Fiske’s was
that, if one thing more than another
could tend to make us dubious as to
its truth, it would be the perusal of
his own book. But <i>revenons</i>: “The
story is a venerable one,” he proceeds
<i>in re</i> “Jack and Jill.” “They&mdash;the
children&mdash;fall away from one
another as the moon wanes, and their
water-pail symbolizes the supposed
connection of the moon with rainstorms.”</p>

<p>Leaving our readers to ponder over
this profound mystery so solemnly
set forth by the author, dazzled and
bewildered, doubtless, by this latest
exhibition of moonshine, we pass from
it to other things. It is of a piece
with all the author’s deductions, and
as fair a sample as any other of the
ingenuity of his argument and the
profundity of his conclusions. We
do not attempt to refute them; that
task is above us; we leave such questions
to be argued out in their more
fitting sphere, where the characters
in the story are best known and believed
in&mdash;the nursery.</p>

<p>To all this sort of thing we do not
object; it is very harmless, and though
scarcely the style of study and method
of deduction one might expect
from a professor of philosophy at
what is esteemed the leading university
in the United States, we can only
arrive, however regretfully, at the conclusion
that we had perhaps made a
false estimate of the intellectual standing
of that university, and of the calibre,
mental and moral, of its professors.
Still, Mr. Fiske may argue all
his lifelong in this fashion, and we
can only wish him better employment.
But unfortunately he does not stop
here.</p>

<p>All the unravelling of these worthless
myths has one aim and tendency:
the connecting with them true
religion, Judaism first, and afterwards
Christianity, the belief in Christ, the
Christian sacraments, Christian observances,
Christian practices; not as
the one truth of which all these
myths formed so many broken and
distorted fragments, but&mdash;hear it,
Christian fathers who send your sons
to Harvard to learn wisdom and truth
from such men as the one under our
notice&mdash;a myth with the rest of them!</p>

<p>Ulysses, Achilles, Ormutz, Thor,
Tell, William of Cloudeslee, the sun,
Jesus Christ&mdash;“These be thy gods,
O Israel!”</p>

<p>A mad world, my masters! We
are all wrong; living in a myth, worshipping
a myth, teaching a myth,
our social and political state to-day
built upon a myth. “We may learn
anew the lesson, taught with fresh
emphasis by modern scholarship,
that in the deepest sense there is nothing
new under the sun.” So says
Mr. Fiske. There is nothing sure
but scientific faith as expounded by
M. Littré and&mdash;Mr. Fiske. All the
rest is myth.</p>

<p>It would be no surprise to us if
Mr. Fiske were indignantly to reject
the construction which the Catholic,
or the Christian reader of whatever denomination,
who possesses any knowledge
of Christianity, must put upon his
words. Apparently he himself is not
sufficiently acquainted with Christianity
to understand the meaning of those
words; and yet he is a “professor
of philosophy” at a presumably
Christian university. He is, to judge
him by this book, of that school of
would-be atheists so fashionable tod-ay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
who talk mild infidelity over
their tea, and take it down with their
muffins&mdash;a toast-and-water infidelity,
nice to take hob-and-nob with and to
the admiration of some antiquated
Blue-Stocking. Mr. Fiske, like his
class, might be considered an atheist
did he only possess the faintest
conception of what Christianity
meant. An atheist is not a man
who does not, but who <i>will</i> not, know
God&mdash;a rebellious spirit who, like the
fallen archangel who has seduced
him, rejects God, flings back his offering,
and cries out: “I will not
serve!”</p>

<p>Such is atheism&mdash;negation, not unconsciousness;
denial, not lack of
knowledge. Mr. Fiske’s toast-and-water
stuff partakes of the latter character.
It is so very weak, so very
thin, so supremely unconscious of its
feebleness, so full of self-sufficiency,
so sublimely ignorant of the fact that
the poor little hobby-horse which it
rides astride of, and on which it
pranks out, with “all the pomp and
circumstance” of mimic warfare, to
have a tilt with the church, has been
long ago ridden to death by far
doughtier champions than Mr. Fiske,
but with a like result&mdash;a tumble in
the dust. Like the carpet-knight,
who, “but for those vile guns, might
himself have been a soldier,” but for
the vile faith, these carpet-atheists
might themselves have become
Christian. Did we not recollect that
they possess immortal souls destined
for one of two eternities, we might
almost congratulate ourselves on
their defection.</p>

<p>But not to lay so very serious a
charge at Mr. Fiske’s door without
just grounds, we proceed to give a
few instances of that gentleman’s
mythical contortions, which will sufficiently
vindicate the severe strictures
we feel compelled to pass upon his
book&mdash;a book, indeed, which should
have passed unnoticed, only that it
is typical of the tone and tendency
of the class of writers remarked upon
above.</p>

<p>Mr. Fiske would seem to have received
some sort of a Christian education,
if we may so call it, in his
youth; for he tells us “of that burning
Calvinistic hell with which his
childish imagination had been unwisely
terrified.” Calvinism probably
drove him into revolt against
Christianity, as it has driven so many
others, and, instead of returning, and
examining, and searching for truth,
he has adopted the easier course of
saying that it was all a sham&mdash;the
devil was only a bogy conjured up
by nurses to frighten children and
make them good. Christianity was
an excellent religion for children and
timid old maids; but for <span class="smcap">MEN</span>, men of
the XIXth century, it was a little too
much. On reading the fables of the
pagans, he found that they had their
bogies to frighten their children, as
the heathen possesses them still. All
the same, all the same, all the way
down to the cradle, if there be such,
of the race.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Black spirits and white,<br />
Red spirits and gray,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Mingle, mingle, mingle,<br />
You that mingle may.”</p>

<p class="p1">Such, if put into a coherent shape,
would be, we think, Mr. Fiske’s
mode of explaining his belief. To
him all mystery is myth, and the one
true guide is scientific faith.</p>

<p>There is no mention of Revelation
from beginning to end of the book:
the author evidently does not believe
in it. But though he is careful not
to say so in express words, the meaning
of all his deductions is very clear;
and passages from the sacred Scriptures
are contorted to suit his purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, we are told<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that “the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
idea of an archfiend, Satan, which
Christianity received from Judaism,
seems to have been suggested by the
Persian Ahriman, or at least to have
derived its principal characteristics
from that source. There is no evidence
that the Jews, previous to the
Babylonish captivity, possessed the
conception of a devil as the author
of all evil. In the earlier books of
the Old Testament, Jehovah is represented
as dispensing with his own
hand the good and the evil, like the
Zeus of the <i>Iliad</i>.”</p>

<p>Of course, to a man of Mr. Fiske’s
vast knowledge and profound erudition,
it would be an impertinence to
suggest that, as the name&mdash;the mere
name, apart from all belief in it&mdash;Jehovah
is the more ancient of the
two, it might have been more in order
to invert its position, so that it would
run: “The Zeus of the <i>Iliad</i>, like
the Jehovah of the Old Testament,
was the dispenser of good and evil.”
But Mr. Fiske studiously sets Jehovah
first in place, though second in
time, giving one to understand thereby
that Zeus was his precursor. This
may have been done inadvertently,
but, if so, there is a strange method
in Mr. Fiske’s carelessness. He is
clearly a believer in that</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">
“Divinity which doth shape our ends,<br />
Rough hew them as we may.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then, again, Mr. Fiske is correct
enough in the passages which he cites
as showing that the Jehovah of the
Old Testament dispenses “with his
own hand the good and the evil.”
There is nothing startling in this: it is
the soundest Catholic as well as Jewish
doctrine. We believe that God does
dispense the good and the evil alike;
but the “dispensing of the good and
the evil” is a very different thing
from the phrase which concludes the
preceding sentence: “The author of
<i>all</i> evil.” Mr. Fiske plumes himself
on his philological knowledge; he is
great in word-science, if we may so
call it; does he, then, recognize no distinction
between “a dispenser” and
“an author,” or again, between evil
and evil, or still further, between
“evil” and “<i>all</i> evil”?</p>

<p>“Evil is natural and moral,” says
the dictionary. In the first sense, it
means what we generally comprehend
by the word “misfortune”; as, evil
tidings, evil news, evil accident. In
this sense, God is said to be the dispenser
of evil; that is, of trials which
he sets his children, as a father sets
his son a hard task, to prepare them,
to test them, to educate them, to lift
them up to the fulness of manhood,
which is in God. “Whom the Lord
loveth, he chastiseth.” But “moral
evil” or what Mr. Fiske calls “all
evil,” is a very different thing. It is
that which is evil naturally, <i>in se</i> and
<i>per se</i>, which is in the will of the
devil, and which it is blasphemy to
attribute to God. Evil in the first
sense may be, is generally, good in
itself: the latter, never. It may not
be blasphemy in Mr. Fiske, for, as
we said, he does not, from insufficient
acquaintance with the subject, know
the meaning of his own words. But
observe how carefully all these words
are placed in connection and juxtaposition
one with another, and how
easily each slides into its wrong place.
Again, there is a singular method in
Mr. Fiske’s glaring&mdash;for a milder term
in the face of what we have just
pointed out would be impossible&mdash;inaccuracies.</p>

<p>He goes on: “The story of the
serpent in Eden&mdash;an Aryan story in
every particular, which has crept into
the Pentateuch&mdash;is not once alluded
to in the Old Testament.” To this
he adds a note: “Nor is there any
ground for believing that the serpent
in the <i>Eden-myth</i> is intended for
Satan?” Though Mr. Fiske is overrunning
our space far more than we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
intended he should do at the beginning,
the next sentence is too good to
omit, as replete with a piece of criticism
unique in its simplicity and loftiness
of tone: “The identification (of
the serpent in the Eden-myth with
Satan) is entirely the work of modern
dogmatic theology, and is due, naturally
enough, to the habit, so common
alike among theologians and laymen,
of reasoning about the Bible as if it
were a single book (!), and not a collection
of writings of different ages and
of very different degrees of historic
authenticity.”</p>

<p>To all his readers the question will
naturally suggest itself: Has Mr.
Fiske ever been outside the walls of
Harvard? But there&mdash;we leave the
matter: it suggests its own comment;
and, moreover, Mr. Fiske
promises us, “in a future work entitled
(start not, ye publishers!) <i>Aryana
Vaedjo</i>, to examine, at considerable
length, <i>this interesting myth</i>
of the Garden of Eden.” We hope
to see it.</p>

<p>Well, here we have in plain English
the whole story of the fall of man,
the origin of good and evil in this
world, and the cause of all the consequences
which followed therefrom;
the whole story of the Creation in fact,
as in another place that of the Deluge,
set aside quietly and easily, without
a word of doubt, or difficulty, or hesitation,
as a myth. It would be interesting
to know what Mr. Fiske
does believe on these points&mdash;but
his book is to come. We trust he
will take the pains to set us right on
the subject of the origin of man and
of the Creation generally. Of man
we should judge him to have as high
an opinion as Mr. Darwin, when he
explains his present condition as
being brought about by “that stupendous
process of breeding which
we call civilization; which has
strengthened the feelings by which we
are chiefly distinguished from the
brutes, leaving <i>our primitive bestial
impulses</i> to die for want of exercise, or
checking in every possible way their
further expansion by legislative enactments.
(Draw this to its legitimate
conclusion, and there is no such
thing as morality, it being merely
synonymous with law or education.)
But this process which is transforming
us from savages into civilized men
is a very slow one; and now and
then there occur cases of what physiologists
call atavism, or <i>reversion to an
ancestral type of character</i>.... Now
and then persons are born possessed of
the bestial appetite and cravings of primitive
man, his fiendish cruelty, and
his liking for human flesh.”</p>

<p>This is a Harvard professor who
thus explains what people generally
accredit to the maxims of the Gospel
and the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Morality is simply education or force,
and evil is inherent in the naturally
brutal being, man, who, like Topsy,
gradually “growed” up to what he
is.</p>

<p>It were easy to go on thus multiplying
instances of the truth of our
observation, that Mr. Fiske reduces
Christianity to a myth; but we think
there is enough proof already. We
pass by many things, therefore, where
the author’s display of shallow learning
is only equalled by his flimsy remarks.
In a note (p. 48), he would
have us infer that the Jews believed
in a plurality of gods just as did the
pagans, because Elohim&mdash;God&mdash;is
plural&mdash;a common use of the word
even in the English Version, as when
God says, “Let us go down and
confound their tongue,” etc.; but
the Jews certainly never interpreted
it as meaning anything else than the
one God, whom they adored. It was
merely a foreshadowing of the doctrine
of the Trinity. In another
place, he informs us that S. Ursula is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Artemis and Aphrodite, S. Gertrude
the heathen Holda. He is evidently
unaware that one of the most popular
books of Catholic devotion is written
by the “heathen Holda.” Stupid
inaccuracies of this description are
unaccountable. In any other person
they would indicate a mind inflated
with that dangerous “little learning”
which Pope warns us against; in a
Harvard “professor of philosophy,”
they doubtless take the form of Shakespeare’s
sins against grammar and
good taste, and go down as “beauties.”
“Angels&mdash;women with large
wings” (<i>sic</i>)&mdash;are kinsfolk of the werewolf
family, and Christianity has “<i>degraded</i>
the beneficent lightning-god,
Thor,” into the “grotesque mediæval
devil.” Odin and other glorious divinities
undergo a similar hideous
transformation under the “degrading”
influence of Christianity. In
fact, Christianity is but a system of
plagiarizing, and plagiarizing which
by no means improves on the old
pagan superstitions. The devil is
really a good-natured sort of being,
or was till Christianity came and
spoiled his temper and himself generally.
Of course such a being never
existed except in the brain of superstitious
people unendowed with scientific
faith, who were racking their
brains to find out the meaning of that
eternal puzzle, darkness and light, so
that they at length came to embody
darkness in the form of the devil, and
light in the person of God, or Jupiter,
or Apollo, or William Tell. That is
the plain English of Mr. Fiske’s
book.</p>

<p>Mr. Fiske seems to think that he
has struck a new vein, and opened up
to the world a golden ore long hidden.
His theory is as old as any
other; and he has only given us a
poor rehash of what much cleverer
men than he have oversurfeited us
with ages ago. Before attempting to
handle the subjects he has touched
upon, it would be advisable to go to
school again, and he might thus be
saved a lamentable display of childish
ignorance on points known to all the
world, save apparently to Mr. Fiske.
In a very weak review of a most interesting
and clever book, <i>Juventus
Mundi</i>, written by a scholar and a
thinker, neither of which titles we feel
justified in applying to Mr. Fiske,
this latter gentleman remarks, with
astonishment, that Mr. Gladstone
draws an analogy between the gods
of heathendom and the God of Christianity;
in other words, between distorted
truth and its first original.
This, again, is as old as the hills.
<i>Prometheus</i>, for instance, has struck
all readers as a wonderful type of the
Saviour; and so with other gods and
heroes of antiquity. Scholars are
pleased to draw likenesses between
the characters of the fables of pagan
antiquity and those of the sacred
Scriptures; such connection is by no
means necessary to prove the truth
of Christianity and of the doctrines
of Revelation. Christianity is here,
around us, living, real: we are in it.
It is clear, well defined, unchanging,
distinct, a solemn and awful fact: deal
with <i>it</i>, study it, destroy it, if you can.
It has no connection, claims no connection,
needs no connection, with
paganism. It stands alone, self-sufficient,
for God is its centre. It embraces
the world; it rules nations;
and the better the governments, the
nearer they approach to the observance
of its codes. History hallows
it; scientific discovery only tends to
confirm our faith in it. It is superseding
all things, as its Founder meant
it should; and people have the impudence,
for it is nothing else, to come
and tell us to-day, in out-of-the-way
notes in silly books, that this stupendous
fact is a myth! We can only
say to them, <i>tolle, lege</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>It is easy for a man to sit down in
his chair, and spin out a theory, connecting
the most distant objects together
in his own mind. Thus Mr.
Fiske drives Tell back to the sun, or
Ulysses, or Odysseus, as he prefers to
call him, for he takes kindly to what
we may be pardoned calling the <i>Grotesque</i>
etymology; and even in this,
like all poor imitators, goes beyond
his master. Homer tells us Ulysses
was a man, a great traveller, who had
seen many lands. Oh! no, says Mr.
Fiske; Homer made a great mistake;
he did not know what he was talking
about; Ulysses was meant for the
sun. And yet Mr. Fiske tells us
that the “minds of primitive men
worked like our own, and, when they
spoke of the far-darting sun-god,
they meant just what they said.”
Why should not this reasoning hold
good for Ulysses, as well as for
Apollo?</p>

<p>Why, we might take up the story
of Mr. Stanley’s discovery of Livingstone,
and concoct a far better myth
out of it than Mr. Fiske has out of
many of his materials. Livingstone,
like Ulysses, is a man who had seen
many lands; he is hurried away and
lost to the world in a dark and fiery
country&mdash;a land of demons and impenetrable
burning deserts. The world
laments his loss, and Stanley, the
youthful, the Dawn, goes out to seek
him, and, after the usual obstacles,
finds him in the dark land, clothed in
rags, with a blue cap on his head,
adorned with a gold band, a long
beard falling gray over his breast,
surrounded by the dark children of
the desert. When that fabulous New
Zealander sits on the ruins of London
Bridge, some future Professor Fiske
will probably take up this story of
to-day, and weave a myth out of it as
the present one has done with Ulysses;
but Mr. Fiske may remember
that the prophet who foretold the
New Zealander in his incongruous
position only did so to serve as an
example of the indestructibility of
God’s church.</p>

<p>If he must refer everything back to
light, why not go a little beyond the
sun to the <i>Lux Mundi</i>&mdash;the light
which shineth in the darkness, but
which the darkness comprehended
not? Light and fire run from the
beginning to the end of the New and
Old Testaments, as typical of God.
The first thing God made was light;
he spoke to Moses in a burning bush;
his angel accompanied his people in
a cloud and a pillar of light. Man
cannot look upon his face and live,
for the glory of it. Is it possible that
Mr. Fiske, who is so keen at connections,
could miss such palpable indications
of the connection between
the traditions he has mentioned and
Revelation, without being struck by it,
unless he did so intentionally?</p>

<p>Had we space, we could show by
comparison that the very words he
has quoted from Indian and other
traditions of the Michabo, the great
white One, of the origin of the world
and the history of the Deluge, are
almost identical in phrase even with
the Scriptures. From F. De Smet’s
interesting Indian sketches, appearing
in the <i>Catholic Review</i>, we find
that the Indians adore the Great
Medicine, who is, above all, the All-powerful,
and sacrifice to him through
the sun and the thunder, because
the sun is his great servitor.</p>

<p>And as for the devil, whom Mr.
Fiske finds such an amusing character
(happy man! may he never be
undeceived!), it may make him laugh
at us, but, for our part, we have a very
decided belief in his existence and
power to do harm; in fact, did we
only discern a spice of something
stronger and more powerful than Mr.
Fiske presents us in his book, just the
faintest flavor of the genuine article&mdash;real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
brimstone and fire&mdash;we should
have been led to refer its authorship
to the very personage whom Mr.
Fiske so despises. As it is, the work
is unworthy of his Satanic majesty.
He inspired the idea which animates
it long ago, but the present execution
is by too weak a hand for his.
In this we find an indication that the
idea is used up and gone beyond
working order&mdash;driven to death, in
fact.</p>

<p>Superstition undoubtedly did exist
in the middle ages; perhaps&mdash;for we
are not too ready to believe this age
so very far superior in many points
to those days as is generally conceded;
at all events, the world, as the
world, is materially even very little
better off than it then was, notwithstanding
all our boasted science, and
the rest, and the days allotted to man
are not lengthened&mdash;perhaps, then,
superstition did flourish at that time
to a greater extent than it does to-day;
but what does that prove?
Simply that Christianity, “that stupendous
process of breeding,” did
not convert the world in a day.</p>

<p>Did superstition prevail to a greater
or less degree than it did prior to the
introduction of Christianity, before
the old Jewish order passed away,
and gave place to the new&mdash;to the religion
which was no longer to be restricted
to a single nation, but which
was to spread abroad, to become Catholic,
and embrace the world, the
family of God’s human creatures,
within its bosom? Was it, so much
of it as did exist, more or less hideous
in the supernatural figures with which
it peoples the universe? Were the
Norse gods of blood and bestiality,
Thor, and Odin, and Friga, “degraded”?
Could they be degraded?
Was Venus degraded, or Jupiter, or
Bacchus, or the multitude of others, by
being replaced by the truth, by the
light which was so long coming and
expected of the nations&mdash;by the Sun
of Justice?</p>

<p>It was this bursting of the light of
the world upon nations which dispelled
for ever the dark mists of superstition
that had so long hidden the
creation from its Creator; this was
the Sun the nations dimly saw and
adored; this was the victorious
Conqueror who overcame all obstacles
by his own sufferings, and
death, and sacrifice; who, like Prometheus,
“came to cast fire upon the
earth,” and who died in agony to
save his fellows, and destroy the false
Jove with his heaven of immorality&mdash;Jesus
Christ! at whose name “every
knee shall bow.”</p>

<p>And the darkness was this very
devil, the author of all evil, who fell,
freely and consciously, in eternal rebellion
against God; who cannot be
destroyed, for God created him immortal;
who uses the power still left
him, which was once heavenly, in
order to lead into rebellion all creation
against the God he hates with
an eternal hatred; who is permitted
by God to tempt man, for man is a
free agent&mdash;God not having endowed
a mere machine with the breath
of life, the breathing of his spirit&mdash;and,
if man falls, he falls freely and
consciously as did Satan.</p>

<p>Here lay the puzzle of darkness and
light, good and evil, right and wrong.
The world saw itself bounded everywhere
by the impassable; by its wickedness
it had lost the clear knowledge
of its God; it would overleap those
barriers, and reach him again. The
craving of its heart was eternal; it
saw the marks of its God around it:
“The heavens declared the glory of
God, and the firmament displayed the
wonders of his works.” Men felt the supernatural,
and worshipped; but their
eyes were blinded, and, groping in the
darkness for their God, they mistook
his enemy, and worshipped him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Paganism was and is the worship
of the devil. The evil one allows
men to worship him under whatever
form they please, provided only they
rebel against God. Impurity, bestiality,
drunkenness, intellectual pride, all
things that lead astray, are for him
good; but the law of God is one and
unchangeable, the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever; and, therefore,
though it is hard to kick against the
goad, the free-will of man whispers
rebellion to him ever, for he finds
God everywhere.</p>

<p>What, then, dealt the death-blow
to superstition? Was it scientific
faith, or the coming of Christ?</p>

<p>In order completely to fill a void,
you must have something adequate.
The world through all the ages had
this yearning for a something wanting,
this searching after a something
lost. It felt the supernatural, the beyond&mdash;it
felt, but did not see. So
each one made him a religion of his
own. To fill that eternal void, to
make all one, to satisfy the craving
of the world, that void must be filled.
But what can fill it, save the supernatural?
An infinite want can only
be filled by infinity. Jesus Christ
came in form and with surroundings
the very reverse of what those who
had waited most anxiously for him
expected. Consequently, their pride
revolted, and they refused to accept
the Messiah. Nevertheless, no sooner
was his doctrine made known, than
the world outside, the gropers in the
darkness, felt the Sun; the scales dropped
from their eyes, the void was at
length filled, the craving satisfied;
they saw their God, and knew him.
Then superstition ended, for they
found a reason for every mystery in
the all-powerful, all-pervading God.</p>

<p>Had the world to wait for scientific
faith to clear up its doubts and give a
reason for its longings and beliefs, superstition
would still reign paramount
among men. What is scientific faith?
What can it do? That science has
advanced since the days when men
built the pyramids, constructed cities
whose ruins are the wonders of to-day,
converted the Eastern deserts
into gardens, constructed the alphabet,
built the Parthenon, devised the
geometrical figure, organized the sciences
of numbers, philosophy, the
heavens, and set up leaning towers,
we concede; but the men who performed
those wonders can scarcely
be set down as “knowing nothing of
the laws of nature, nothing about
physical forces, nothing about the relations
of cause and effect.” This
age has made an advance on them, it
is true; but an advance utterly disproportionate
to the centuries which
have rolled between; nay, in some
things it has retrograded.</p>

<p>Did people wait, then, for scientific
faith to lift the veil from their eyes,
or was it the teachings of Christianity
and the appearance of Jesus Christ
which lifted it? How much more
has scientific faith taught us than it
taught the men who centuries ago, by
their intimate and accurate knowledge
of natural causes, wrought those wonders
touched upon above? The supernatural
still confronts us as it did
them. Science ends with the scientist.
Can it tell him who he is, or
why he is? Can it touch the lightning,
weigh the sun, reveal the mystery
of life and death? It can tell
us we live and we die; that, when such
or such a circumstance occurs, what
we call life is over. But can it tell us
what is life, whence it came, whither
it goes? what the world is, who made
it, why it was made? what the seed
is, why it grows up into a tree, why
the leaves sprout from the hard wood,
who set all this principle of life going,
and why? Here lies the mystery
that puzzled men; here science
stops, and God reveals himself: it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
awed into silence, and listens for his
voice.</p>

<p>On reading this article once more,
the thought has occurred to the writer
that objection may be taken to its
tone as not exactly in accordance
with that myth of myths which goes
by the name of “amenities of literature.”
Catholics very rarely come
across this pleasing illusion in the columns
of adverse writers. But even
should this charge be well grounded,
it is idle for Catholics to wrap what
they have to say in wadding, lest it
fall too roughly on the delicate sensibilities
of people who undertake to
insult a religion of which they know
nothing. Mr. Fiske is only a type of
a class to whom is entrusted the sacred
mission of educating the youth
of this country, those particularly
whose means admit of the highest
education, and from whom, therefore,
much should be expected. Men wonder
at the immorality of our youth&mdash;the
young man of society of to-day.
Why wonder, when his professors
teach him that morality is a name,
Christianity a fable, and all religion a
sham? We cannot affect to toy
when the stakes played for are so
high. The morality of the coming
race depends on the education it receives.
When, therefore, we find
men, set in high places in our foremost
universities, abusing their position,
and striving by every means in
their power to sap and undermine
Christian education, we think studious
phrases idle and polished courtesy
thrown away. Insult and evil
must be met with other weapons. If
Mr. Fiske wishes to know whether
Christianity is a myth or not, let him
sit down and study before pronouncing.
When he has sought and inquired
earnestly, he will find plenty
to furnish him with the right answer.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> all things that are not of precept,
we must needs, if we wish to
influence the world, take the world
as it is. We may deplore that the
stream has passed the romantic scenery
through which its course once
flowed, but we are powerless to
turn the current back. Indeed, its
oncoming strength is so ominous
that no wise man can stand long on
its banks without seeing the urgent
need of providing fresh outlets for its
impetuosity, lest it should come upon
him unawares, and sweep him away
in a roaring inundation. The mental
ferment of our age is this stream
which demands of us new channels
whereon to spend its exuberant activity;
and it perhaps depends upon
Catholic action whether the new development
shall be a blessing or a
curse. The church knows that her
place is in the van of humanity, and
to each young century she turns her
speedy encouragement, bidding it go
forth and do its allotted work under
her banner. She hallows all discoveries,
and knits them to herself by the
services she causes them to render to
the truth, and, a bolder innovator
than the veriest sceptic, she opens
her arms to every development
whose capabilities may be turned to
a divine account. We may depend
upon this: that no new thing or idea
which does not at once draw upon
itself the church’s approving notice,
is worth more than a passing thought.
She lets the ephemeral go by, and
fixes her eyes only on the stable and
the solid. More than that, all that is
claimed as new and good is contained
or foreshadowed somewhere within
her pale, either in the hidden
achievements of her sons, or in the
written record of her attitude towards
human progress.</p>

<p>Now, the position of woman is a
topic universally discussed, and one
which it has become the fashion to
look upon as the pet offspring of this
particular century. There are two
questions involved in the discussion:
one theoretical, upon which we have
already touched, and one practical.
The former treats of the abstract right
of equality between man and woman,
the latter (more sensibly) of the employment
of women, and of their fitness
for bread-winning purposes.
Woman has so many spheres that it
is difficult to mass her duties and
rights in one sweeping code; and,
though her peculiar gift of home
ministry is the one which renders
her most amiable in the eyes of the
opposite sex, it should be remembered
that it is this very domesticity
which often obliges her to take to
self-supporting labor. In this, how
far superior is womanhood to manhood!
For whereas a man’s chief
thought when entering a profession
or learning a trade is for his own advancement
and pecuniary success in
life, a woman’s intention when working
for her bread is almost invariably
the support of one weaker than herself,
or the lightening of the burden
already borne by the other. In this
sense, we may say that woman is
more heroic than man, constrained
as she is by the very nobility of her
nature to ennoble the lowest things
with which necessity brings her in
contact. Work in itself, simply as occupation
and discipline, is a noble
thing and the fulfilment of the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
law, but when undertaken with a
motive such as the support of aged
parents and of sick children, or the
reparation of an act of dishonesty
committed by a dishonorable member
of the family, it rises even to sublimity.
Women are not exempt from
the law of labor, though it has
been an immemorial custom that
their fathers, brothers, and husbands
should shield them from its
heaviest penalties. Work, in a mitigated
sense, has always been the lot
of woman, but among Christians it is
so hallowed as to be rather a privilege
than a yoke. In heathen nations,
woman’s work was merely that
of a female animal, necessarily not
quite so hard as man’s, but only lighter
in consideration of her physical
powers, and certainly not in reverence
for her rightful dignity. It was
not the wife and mother who was
thought of then: it was the female
beast of burden, at most the favorite
of the hour. Judaism, the dawn of
a broader and holier dispensation,
naturally betrayed its divine origin
by protecting the person and property
and regulating the labor of woman,
thereby elevating drudgery into
home duties, and raising to the dignity
of a contracting party one who
had been hitherto but a servile tool.
Christianity went a step further, and
threw open the doors of the temple
to woman, suffering her to assume
every position her mental or moral
ambition led her to desire, save the
office of the priesthood. Judaism had
sanctified and glorified marriage by
looking upon every union as a possible
link in the future genealogy of the
Messiah; and the perfection of the
Hebrew ideal culminated in Mary,
the veritable human mother of the
Eternal Word. But Christianity had
an additional crown to bestow on
womanhood, and, unlike Judaism, instead
of leading up to this new perfection,
it first reared its ideal, and
then called upon all unborn generations
to follow it as closely as might be.
Thus the two systems, marriage and
virginity, converged for one miraculous
moment in the stainless person
of the Blessed Virgin Mary; and
since after that unique motherhood
there could be no aspiring to become
an earthly ancestor of the Promised
One, a new relationship with God&mdash;that
of Spouse&mdash;came to be the highest
honor attainable by womanhood.
Step by step, God had brought about
woman’s enfranchisement, had united
in his law the dignity with which the
Jews had invested her, and a new,
mysterious, unearthly dignity which
he alone can understand, and had, in
one word, made perfection easy of
attainment by her. Her work, too,
necessarily came under this ennobling
process, and she can look back
with pride to the example of the typical
woman&mdash;the last perfect Jewish
matron, the first perfect Christian
virgin&mdash;and see the daughter of
kings and the Mother of God stooping
to lowly household duties.</p>

<p>The Old and New Testament are
full of circumstances or sayings with
reference to the subject of woman’s
work. Although it is not expressly
mentioned in the curse pronounced
on Adam after the Fall, there can be
little doubt that it is included in it.
The race of man was there doomed
to earn its bread by the sweat of its
brow, and though a special punishment
was also awarded the offending
“mother of all the living,” still she
seems to have been included in the
general curse of labor. Events have
proved this, and so long and regular
a succession of events must needs
have had a deeper reason than mere
temporal expediency. In the history
of Jacob and his two wives, we see a
plain reference to the importance of
woman in a question of wages and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
inheritance. Jacob, after serving his
father-in-law Laban for twenty years,
departs secretly, but before doing so
takes counsel with his wives, and puts
his case before them, calling them to
witness that Laban has overreached
him and striven to do him harm.
Their answer is as practical as could
be wished for: they complain of
their father having wasted their lawful
inheritance and having counted
them as strangers, while they commend
Jacob for championing their
rights by taking, as the Lord had
commanded, all that was otherwise
denied them.</p>

<p>In the history of the infant Moses,
Pharaoh’s daughter makes a regular
engagement with the child’s unknown
mother “to nurse him for her,
and she would give her <i>her wages</i>.”
It was a fair contract, by which the
Hebrew woman earned an equivalent
for her services as nurse.</p>

<p>Then, again, we have Anna, the
wife of Tobias, a genuine bread-winner,
though perhaps a lesser example
of patience than she is of energy.
“Now, Anna his wife went daily to
weaving work, and she brought home
what she could get for their living
by the labor of her hands.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The
picture of her domestic trials is pathetic,
and her husband seems to
have had but a poor opinion of her
discretion, for he asked her one day,
when she had brought home a
young kid, whether she were sure
that it was not stolen? Her answer
was certainly petulant, and consisted
of what many modern wives would
say under the same provocation, but
it was ungrateful towards God. Human
nature was much the same then
as it is now; and one charm of the
old Bible narratives lies just in this,
that they <i>are</i> so naïvely human. In
the Book of Ecclesiasticus we read:
“He created of him [man] a helpmate
like to himself: he gave <i>them</i>
counsel and a tongue, and eyes, and
ears, and a heart to devise....”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
The woman is here expressly included
in the intellectual benefits heaped
upon man, and it is contrary to the
whole spirit of the Scriptures to suppose
that these gifts were in her
merely ornamental. Matters of foresight,
discretion, and business evidently
come under the head of things
to be “devised.” Again, a little further
on we find that “a good wife is a
<i>good portion</i>,” and “the grace of a
diligent woman shall delight her husband
and shall <i>fat his bones</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> By
this is meant “increase his substance,”
which a woman can do in
two ways&mdash;by husbanding her means,
or earning something herself. Even
if the “diligent woman” gave her
husband nothing but counsel, that in
itself would be a material help: “A
<i>prudent</i> wife is from the Lord.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>To guard against the abuses of
unremunerated labor, to which
through poverty or improvidence the
Hebrews might be subjected, Moses
provided the law of the seventh year of
remission and the fiftieth of jubilee.
“Thou shalt not oppress him with
the service of bond-servants, but he
shall be as a <i>hireling</i> and a <i>sojourner</i>,”
and “<i>his wages</i> being allowed for
which he served before.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> With regard
to women, the laws were the
same. “When thy brother a Hebrew
man or Hebrew <i>woman</i> is sold
to thee and hath served thee six
years, in the seventh year thou shalt
let him go free. And when thou
sendest him out free, <i>thou shalt not
let him go away empty</i>; but shalt give
him for his way out of thy flocks,
and out of thy barn-floor and thy
wine-press,”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and it is specially recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that bondmen and bondwomen
should not be of the chosen
race, but of the “nations around” the
Hebrews. As to the responsibility
of women concerning vows, we read
that a woman under the power of
her father or husband shall be
bound to fulfil a vow contingently on
the consent of her superior, but an
independent woman is bound like a
man: “The widow, and she that is
divorced, <i>shall fulfil whatsoever</i> they
vow.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> This argues at least a recognition
of woman’s full powers of
reasoning, choice, and accountability,
all of which are involved in the serious
matter of a vow. In the Gospel
of S. Luke, there is a passing allusion
to female manual labor in the parable
that foretells Christ’s second
coming: “<i>Two women</i> shall be
<i>grinding</i> together, the one shall be
taken and the other left”&mdash;which allusion
is not meaningless. All through
the New Testament, additional light
is thrown on the figurative expressions
by the common customs of the
country during our Lord’s human
life in Judea, and so we may infer
that in those days women frequently
helped their husbands in various agricultural
pursuits.</p>

<p>Martha, the sister of Lazarus, has
always been looked upon as a type
of active, busy life, according to our
Lord’s words, “Thou art troubled
about many things.” But this was
not wholly meant as a rebuke, for
there is a great difference between
being <i>troubled</i> and being <i>absorbed</i> by
worldly matters. Some among us
must bear the domestic burden, in
order that others may have the
leisure needed for contemplation.
Their place in the world is none the
less holy because it is not the most
perfect, for if there were no rungs to
the ladder but the topmost one, how
would it be possible to reach heaven?
The workers of this world have a
mission as well as the seers, and
Martha holds almost as high a place
in heaven as her sister who chose
“the better part.” In the Acts of
the Apostles, it is related that S.
Paul, going out of the gates of Philippi
and seeing there some women
assembled, spoke to them, whereupon
“a certain woman named
Lydia, <i>a seller of purple</i> of the city
of Thyatira ... did hear ... and
when she was baptized, <i>and her
household</i>, she besought us, saying:
... come into my <i>house</i> and abide
there. And she constrained us.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
This woman must doubtless have
been sufficiently well-off, and was
most likely a widow or an unmarried
woman. Her business, which she
probably conducted herself, since she
is distinguished by the epithet “a
seller of purple,” must have brought
her affluence, for her house and
household are specially mentioned,
and it strikes us also as a proof of
her self-supporting and successful
operations, that, being of the city of
Thyatira, she had travelled to Philippi
and established a home for herself
within its walls. S. Paul and
Silas are put in prison and freed
again while in Philippi, and as soon
as they leave their confinement, it is
to Lydia’s house that they again repair.
“And they went out of the
prison, and entered into the house of
Lydia; and having seen the brethren,
they comforted them and departed.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
The natural inference is
that the house of the generous
“seller of purple” was the centre, for
the time being, of the little Christian
community; that here were the assemblies
held and religious ceremonies
performed; and that Lydia, in
fact, gave up her dwelling to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
practically a school and church.
Her riches were her own; legitimately
accumulated by an ordinary trade.
We are told nothing of her origin,
her education, her social position;
she appears only as a “seller of purple”
and a docile recipient of God’s
Word. There was probably nothing
at all wonderful about her&mdash;she was
the ordinary business woman of her
day: thrifty, since she had worked to
so successful a purpose&mdash;simple-minded,
since she so quickly believed the
Word of God&mdash;generous, since she
“constrained” the Apostles to dwell
with her. S. Paul, who found in women
such powerful auxiliaries, speaks
in his Epistle to the Romans of
“Phœbe, our sister in the ministry of
the church [a deaconess] ... that
you assist her in whatsoever <i>business</i>
she shall have need of you: for she
also <i>hath assisted many</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Now,
this clearly points to her having, or
having had, either great possessions,
which must have entailed many cares
of management, or great zeal in stirring
up others who were wealthier,
which zeal also proves a capability
for affairs. But let us turn back to
yet more emphatic Scriptural proof
that woman is noways debarred
from a certain share in even great
enterprises, so long as her modesty
is not endangered by it. Judith, the
queenly widow, occupied a position
of this kind. “And her husband
left her great riches, and very many
servants, and large possessions of
herds and oxen.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The sequel of
Judith’s history showed that she was
as wise as she was rich, and that
prudence and discretion were her
most conspicuous gifts. She must
have had great powers of government,
and an eye for ruling the
many subordinates whom she probably
employed in the management
of her possessions. She was no
doubt a mother and a guardian to
her servants, and, although young
and beautiful, as the Scripture tells us
she was, yet possessed a gravity and
dignity beyond her years. Her
mind was not set upon the frivolities
of social life, and she gave herself
much to prayer and fasting, abiding
“shut up with her maids” in an
upper chamber of her house. It is a
great mistake to suppose that piety
interferes with business habits in
either man or woman. The legitimate
cares of life are perfectly compatible
with an unusual degree of
spirituality, indeed, in many cases
such cares become absolute duties.
The spiritual life reacts upon the
outer sphere of business relations,
and while eliminating from it all tendency
to mere selfish aggrandizement,
enhances and hallows the
worldly qualities requisite to its successful
development. The world
needs holy and grave influences to
leaven its pursuits in every field,
whether artistic, literary, or commercial,
and while women can impart to
every lawful calling into which they
enter that natural grace and refinement
which is their birthright, they
should also strive to infuse into it a
supernatural influence. In the Book
of Proverbs,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> we read the memorable
description of the “wise woman,”
and nothing is further removed
than this Scripture ideal from the various
types of modern womanhood
which, in the clamor of the present
questions as to woman’s place and
proper employment, have terrified the
sight and darkened the understanding
of observers. Of her devotion to her
husband, it is said that “his heart
trusteth in her, <i>and he shall have
no need of spoils</i>.” She is not of that
aggressive, self-protecting type with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
which we are (for our sins) familiar;
she is not of those to whom a husband
is an appendage, insignificant
at all times, removable at any; she
is not of the independent sisterhood
who take their passions for inspirations
and their caprices for rules.
Her influence must mightily serve
her husband’s lawful interests, for we
are told that “he is honorable in the
gates when he sitteth among the
senators of the land.” This points
to the wise woman’s high social position,
no doubt more due to her efforts,
her industry, and her prudence,
than simply to her noble birth. She
might&mdash;like many of her modern sisters&mdash;have
been born in the more
fortunate walks of life, she might
have been educated with care and
assiduity, she might have been taught
that perfect command of domestic
details which secures an orderly and
attractive household, she might even
have acquired that unconscious good-breeding
that marks the well-born
and gently nurtured all over the civilized
world; and yet with all these
advantages she might still have failed
to take a place in life&mdash;she might
still have remained a social nonentity.
How many such worthy and
estimable blanks are there not in this
world, in all ranks and shades of social
standing! But the model woman
of the Scripture has risen above
this level of neglected or barren opportunities,
and bears away the first
honors of the race of life, simply because
she is <i>wise</i>. The prudence of
her counsels, shown in the ordering
of her well-appointed household, her
bargains and her forethought, her
stores of bread, linen, and wool, redound
to her husband’s honor; and
when he “sitteth among the senators”
he is known as possessing a
treasure that doubles all his wealth,
and is herself worth all his riches
thrice doubled. But she is not entirely
dependent on him in her transactions,
for we see that “she hath
considered a field and bought it;
with the fruit of her hands she hath
planted a vineyard.” This bears
very closely on our subject, and
proves how far the Scriptures hold a
woman competent to think, speculate,
work, and achieve, unassisted by
man. “She hath tasted and seen
that her traffic is good: ... she made
fine linen and sold it, ... and
hath not eaten her bread idle.” Now,
all this points to more than mere domestic
thrift. Here we see woman,
not as a divorced wife, not as an aggressive
spinster, not as a frivolous
social ornament, not as a mere household
drudge, but woman as a responsible
being, with grave duties and a
wide field of action, taking a place in
the world fully equal to and yet utterly
distinct from that of a man. She
considers, she buys, she sells, she
rules, yet all the while she is solicitous
for her “maidens,” charitable
and gentle to the poor, beloved by
her husband, and blessed by her children.
She appears here as judged
by the real standard of her real worth.
“Favor is deceitful, and beauty is
vain; the woman that feareth the
Lord, she shall be praised. Give her
of the fruit of her hands; and let her
works praise her in the gates.”</p>

<p>So that she is not only to earn, but
to enjoy. She is to have a stake in
the world, and a voice in matters of
importance&mdash;she “opens her mouth
in wisdom, and the law of clemency
is on her tongue.” Her opinion is
to be sought, considered, followed;
her example is to be looked upon
with reverence, and criticism is to
merge into admiration. Her position
is to be that of an arbiter and
referee, neither sinking to that of a
petted child nor drifting into that
of an unmated, unloved, and defiant
waif. It is not from a band of social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
outlaws, whose common exile links
them in common defence, that she is
to seek support; but in the circle of
her own home, in the centre where
God and nature have placed her, she
is to take the helm and gracefully
mount the throne. No violence and
no straining after impossible immunities
are to disfigure her calm attitude
of secure headship, and, even if her
advice be disregarded, time and not
she herself must vindicate its wisdom.</p>

<p>It may be objected that all this is
very well in theory, and would work
admirably if all women were <i>wise</i>, and
all men worthy of them. But who
does not know that ideals will never
become healthful influences unless
translated into facts, and that theories
will never succeed in bettering
the world unless exemplified here
and there in trial cases? Would the
<i>theory</i> of Christianity be worth anything
to the outside world unless
realized in the daily life of its Founder
and in the model existences of
thousands of saints? It is impossible
that anything should take hold
of the human mind and mould it to
new perfections before it has been
put into tangible shape, and it is
equally impossible in our fallen state
that <i>all</i> the world should be converted
at once into so many perfect entities.
Yet because all men will not
become saints, because all cannot
write like Shakespeare, paint like
Raphael, or compose like Beethoven,
are religion, poetry, and art to be eschewed
by lower aspirants, and relegated
to the barren region of things
to be admired but not imitated?
If, because absolute perfection was
never attainable by man, every man
had therefore resigned himself to a
hopeless contemplation of the fine
possibilities of Christianity, we should
have had no Anthony, no Jerome, no
Augustine. If, later on, because it
was impossible to reform the <i>whole</i>
world and strike at the root of <i>every</i>
abuse, the pontiffs had calmly looked
on while Christendom crumbled
away, we should have had no Gregory
the Great, no Hildebrand, no
Innocent III., no Sixtus V. Again,
if an inflexible adherence to rule
were the only point worth aiming at,
should we have had a Dominic, a
Teresa, a Francis Xavier, a Philip
Neri, a Vincent of Paul? In this
world there are many experiments&mdash;tentative
steps leading to higher
things, and opening doors of possibility
to hitherto untried systems.
Even in the church, where all else is
immovable, there is constant <i>human</i>
progress, and if here or there one
soldier falls at his post&mdash;not through
lack of enthusiasm, but through the
force of adverse circumstances, or
the darkness of mind which still
shrouds his contemporaries while he
himself has prematurely pierced beyond
it&mdash;still the great search after
perfection, the great work of Christian
development, rolls on. So it is
in the world, in art, in philosophy, in
science, in society. What if woman’s
position never has been made absolutely
and securely certain? The
church has always theoretically pointed
it out, and has often secured its
partial realization within her pale; it
remains for the world to open its
eyes, and extend those barriers of the
church to the furthest limits of civilization,
taking with it those improvements
which it has so long groped for
in its wilful darkness, and which all the
time have been steadily in operation
in the sanctuary of the old church.</p>

<p>So that it is idle to object that all
we have said about woman’s work,
reward, and position is “very well in
theory.” If a few pioneers will do
for the system what companies or
even enterprising individuals are ever
ready to do for any material scheme
that presents but the slightest chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of success, the world would soon see
the noblest reform of all achieved in
the very core of society. Nay, we
will say more: the pioneers <i>are</i> there,
the reform <i>is</i> going on; only let the
busy, sceptical world stop a moment
and look into the silent, gigantic work
ever renewing its strength in the
church; let it pause and see homes
where woman, either as manager or
worker, holds her supreme rod of
gentle authority; let it see the maiden
toiling cheerfully for her aged parents,
or bringing home food and
clothes to helpless little sisters or ailing
brothers&mdash;the wife helping and
encouraging the husband, and eking
out by skilful management a pittance
into an income, and evolving comfort
out of what in careless hands could
hardly compass necessaries; the widow
keeping her sacred state, unassailed
by calumny, through the earnings
which secure her privacy, or the
widowed mother joyfully burdened
with the twofold legacy that gives
her both an object to live for and a
memory to live in. Hidden homes
these may be, poor homes they almost
all are&mdash;homes bounded by the
four walls of one squalid room, homes
cramped in the garrets of tenement-houses
or saddened by the dreary
respectability of furnished lodgings,
but none the less precious in the
sight of the angels, and an example
in the sight of men.</p>

<p>We have spoken much of the
Scriptural conception of woman as a
bread-winner, because upon this as a
solid foundation we can build up
the further development of such a
woman’s position. Everything that
is compatible with the <i>spirit</i> of this
conception may be said, in broad
comprehensiveness, to be allowable
in woman. Everything that can be
referred to this ideal, as naturally
flowing therefrom, is admissible in
her relations with the great working
hive of mankind. Intellectual labor
especially is befitting to her, within
the limits prescribed by modesty.
Manual labor, especially agricultural
or mining, is proportionately less fitting,
both because of her physical
weakness and more still because of
the too free association with men
which it often necessitates. Domestic
labor, where this is not unreasonably
heavy, is certainly within her
sphere&mdash;and for this no better reason
can be given than that the women
of patriarchal times thought domestic
labor no shame.</p>

<p>With this view, we say that as many
openings for the employment of
woman as can possibly be made, consistently
with delicacy and womanly
modesty, should be speedily contrived.
No one need fear that such
openings will deprive us of necessary
comforts in the way of domestic
attendance; there will always be a
residuum of womankind to whom
service will be the most natural and
desirable outlet, to whom in fact it
will be the only career which will
give scope to the capacities they
have. This will be the least difficulty;
the real problem will always remain
rather on the other side&mdash;that is,
as to how many women can be redeemed
from the bondage of circumstances
by any known method of redemption.
It is appalling to think
of the many women, delicate-minded,
earnest, persevering, who see in their
womanhood, which should be their
crown and their boast, only the barrier
to their aspirations, the prison-door
of their capabilities. It is terrible
to reckon the number of women
who lose themselves, and wander
away from their place in society, either
through the door of open shame or
through the only less revolting path
of that which is called but is not
marriage; or visionary, defiant “independence.”
How many fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
women sadly excuse themselves by
saying that they could find no work
to do, and yet could not bear to
starve! On the other hand, in women
who have obviated that degradation
by leaping into another, we
see the inevitable action of the narrow-mindedness
of the world upon
an undisciplined nature. Women
are often accused of being always in
extremes, and the accusation, in the
case of women untrained by religious
influences, is in the main true, although
it may as well be said that
the fact holds equally good with men
who are not restrained by such influences.
So, between open degradation
and blatant “woman’s rightism,”
the mind of the untutored woman
will almost certainly, except by
a happy chance, find no mean.</p>

<p>Is this picture overdrawn? We
are ready to affirm again and again
that it is not; the annals of society
scandals and the records of the divorce
courts show that it is not; for
what difference is there but a despicable
and conventional one between
the legalized re-marriage of a guilty
woman to her seducer, and the illegal
union of so many unhappy couples
whose relations it is a breach of propriety
even to mention?</p>

<p>This is womanhood outside the
church. It is no more a fancy picture
than that other blessed one of
the homes we have already praised,
the homes of honest work and perfect
peace. The world, to secure a
nation of women bred in such homes,
must turn to the church, and ask her
to teach it the secret of such womanhood.
The secret is in the Gospels,
in the old hallowed traditions
of the Hebrews, and in the fulfilled
evangelical counsels. Voluntary poverty
is the safeguard of holy and
allowable wealth; voluntary obedience
is the counterpart of lawful freedom;
voluntary chastity is the hidden
grace that obtains for others
wedded love and a grave Christian
home. The hostages of humanity
are praying in the cloisters for the
commendable domestic happiness of
their numerous brethren, and, in proportion
as the world scorns their sacrifice,
so does it lose the fruit of their
prayers.</p>

<p>We have said that woman’s work
should be decided, God willing, by
her capabilities. This is to say that
more ways should be open to her
than are open now to improve the
talents God may have given her.
In a great measure she can, and
does, open these ways for herself,
and an energetic nature of course
will, like water, sooner or later “find
its own level.” Still, many who have
mental powers have little strength
in battling with life, and might be
helped if their luckier sisters would
be a little less selfish in their easily
acquired security. Work means self-respect,
and self-respect means success.
There is no one so proud as
the woman who knows her own
worth, and lifts herself by this knowledge
high above all sordid temptations.
She will be a good wife, for
she will choose no man for a husband
save on the lofty principle of
his own worthiness of her, while her
estimate of herself will unconsciously
become his also. She will be a tribunal
to herself and to him, and the
slightest wrong action or paltry motive
in either will take, in the eyes of
the other, the proportions of a blot
on their self-esteem. She will be a
good mother, for her standard of superiority
will be the first her children
will know, and with them it will be
inseparably blent with their personal
affection for their mother. The
home will thus be created on a footing
that years will strengthen as they
pass, and the austere yet happy
gravity of a Christian household will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
become a hereditary tradition with
the children. But for all this, the
basis of work is wanted&mdash;work of
some sort, voluntary occupation or
necessary drudgery, it matters little.
It is the discipline, not the fact, of
work which is essential, and in this
sense the rich and high-born may be
as hard workers as the poor seamstress
or the factory-girl. Yet, since
this labor question touches the poor
chiefly, it is for them we would
chiefly speak. Woman’s work is circumscribed
by her physical powers,
man’s is not. Therefore, in all things
that a woman can do as well as a
man (and of course in all those which
she can do better), the preference
should be given to her. There are
many trades in which men cut not
only a very useless but a most ridiculous
figure, and which the fittingness
of things would point out as woman’s
proper field. Everything relating to
feminine clothing comes under this
head; and were this department
wholly given over to women, it
would at once relieve the poverty
and shield the virtue of many homes,
and also spare the public the absurd
spectacle of strong men engaged in
handling delicate ribbons and filmy
laces. Printing and kindred trades
have been found practicable for women,
and we know that watchmaking
and jewellery work are also accessible
to the “weaker vessel.”
Still, it has at present gone no further
than this, that women are associated
with men in many employments.
Now, we could wish that there should
be many trades of which they would
have an exclusive monopoly. In
this we think there would be no inconvenience;
at any rate, no one
could assert that there was until the
system had been given a fair trial.</p>

<p>Society, in its present state of godless
disorganization, not only affords
very little help to women who are
eager and willing to help themselves,
but positively, despite the loud boasting
of the century as having originated
“woman-reform,” places barriers
in their way. For what else is it but
a barrier to honest advancement
that, when a respectable and virtuous
woman of pleasing appearance goes
to apply for some desirable situation
offered by advertisement, she is
often, very often, insulted by disgusting
propositions, and her very expressions
of indignant surprise put
down as a part skilfully played by
her before the inevitable surrender?
This has been repeatedly done, in
many cases successfully, for precautions
had been taken beforehand to
cut off the victim’s retreat and drown
her cries; in others, when cowardice,
the twin-sister of vice, has shrunk
from the determined attitude of a
virtuous woman at bay, the effort has
happily failed. The public papers
have sometimes&mdash;with their proverbial
inefficiency and spasmodic, theatrical
manner of showing up an abuse
they know it will pay better to speak
of than to act against&mdash;taken in
hand this outrage to civilization, and
published letters from the aggrieved
women detailing the attempted insult,
but how many more women,
sensitive and gentle, shrink with horror
from putting into print an experience
they would gladly blot from
their memory! It will be asked,
what remedy can be devised for this?
Immediate remedy, perhaps none;
but remotely, the remedy of a newly
formed habit of regarding women
with at least the same respect as
men who earn their daily bread.
Physical weakness will always be an
incentive to wicked men to insult unprotected
women&mdash;that is to say, the
vices of fallen human nature will
never be wholly blotted out; and in
this juncture, as in all others, the
real remedy is the influence and authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of the church. Nowhere more
than in Italy&mdash;that maligned country
in which Protestants refuse to see
anything save the last stage of corruption
brought on by an “effete
priesthood and a degraded religion”&mdash;is
that touching charity known of
portioning poor girls and affording
them temporary refuge while out of
employment. In Rome, this was one of
the foremost Papal charities; the Holy
Father took an especial personal interest
in it; the Roman ladies vied with
each other in enlarging the numbers
of its recipients and adding to the
fund provided for its continuance. In
Venice, it used to be the affair of the
Doge, who was conventionally father
to all the dowerless, and the sworn
protector of impoverished and threatened
innocence. Many saints have
made this their favorite charity, and
many Italian marriages in the higher
grades of life are accompanied by
this crowning token of Christian
brotherhood&mdash;the portioning and safe
marrying of a poor young girl who
might have otherwise fallen a victim
to the licentiousness of some professional
<i>roué</i>.</p>

<p>While it is to be deplored that the
openings for female employment
should still be so restricted, it is still
more to be lamented that there are
actually employments in which female
labor is most unwarrantably used.
In mining districts, this is peculiarly
the case. There men and women
work promiscuously, often with very
little clothing on, and with still less
sense of decency and morality. Little
girls are brought up there with no
knowledge of themselves as responsible
moral agents, and conscious only
that their work is not quite so
valuable because their muscles are
not quite so strong as those of their
companions. Ignorance of religion,
of moral restraints, and of social decencies,
combine to make of these
immortal beings only lithe savages,
less enduring than the negro, less
clever than the Indian. For the
white race in some sense seems born
to civilization, and when removed
from civilizing influences relapses
into far more brutal savageness than
others. Again, we find the problem
only solvable through the influence
of the church; for she who originally
drew together the nomad hordes of
the North and East, and gathered
from their ranks the founders of
empires, the lawgivers of her own
system, and the discoverers of the
New World, is still the only mistress
the dominant race which she once
civilized will ever again acknowledge.
Christendom has been rent
in twain, and the Christian nations
deprived of the bond that once knit
them in one vast confederation and
unity of interests; and until this
whole has been restored, barbarism
will struggle periodically to the surface,
and strive to regain that ascendency
it lost more than a thousand
years ago. The abuses and horrors
of female labor in mining districts
are a blot upon civilization which
never had any existence before the
recent disruption of Christendom; for,
wherever an abuse reared its serpent
head, the church was at least there
to protest, and exert her moral influence
if not material force. It is
idle to object that she did not, as a
matter of fact, quell all abuses; this
objection might be urged against the
apparently frustrated mission of our
Lord himself, as far as immediate
tangible reforms were concerned, but
the essential fact stands, that as long
as the church’s authority remained
undisputed there was at least in the
world one tribunal which, being the acknowledged
visible representative of
God, could brand beyond appeal all
encroachments on the rights of the
defenceless, and wither the plans of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
cunning and cruelty against the poor.
To those defended, this was a consolation;
to those upbraided, it was
at least a secret dread.</p>

<p>Having said so much upon the
question of woman’s position as a
bread-winner, we can only end by acknowledging
that whatever is to be
done will have to be done in fragments,
and under the auspices of
private enterprise alone. We cannot
expect that in the present condition
of the world any but individual efforts
will be made for the advancement of
the weaker sex, nor can we anticipate
any but partial and isolated results.
But, nevertheless, these efforts will
not lack their reward, and we, who
in the eyes of the world are now
working in the dark, can be content
with the knowledge that from these
disjointed earthly efforts God is
silently building up a great spiritual
temple of rescued souls. It may be
that we never shall succeed but in
part, but this is the fate of all workers
at a perfect system, and need not
dismay us in the least. Theologians
say that if the merits of our Lord’s
Incarnation and Passion had redeemed
but the single soul of his Blessed
Mother, still such unheard-of merits
would not therefore have been in
the least superfluously applied; and
in the same way may we humbly
think of ourselves, that if each life
spent in the effort of bettering the
condition and widening the intellectual
horizon of woman had no result
save in the increased welfare of one
individual, still the labor of such a
life would not have been in vain.</p>

<p class="pc2">A SHAKESPEARIAN EXCURSUS.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct"><i>Merc.</i>&mdash;“Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim.”&mdash;<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, act ii. sc. I.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Certainly</span>, this very singular prefix
to the ordinary appellation of the
god of love suggests difficulties of
interpretation not easy of solution. It
would appear to be one of those cant
phrases familiar enough, we may
presume, at a certain period, for, if
not readily to be understood, the
poet was unlikely to make use of it
in such a connection. But the reason
for its application has passed out of
mind, and all the commentators have
been at a loss to discover its meaning.
Mr. Singer, editor of a well-known
edition of the poet’s plays, disposes
of the embarrassment in a manner
equally summary and, as it seems to
us, unsatisfactory. Accepting the
suggestion of Mr. Upton, another
commentator, that the word “Abraham”
should be “Adam,” these critics
agree in conferring upon Cupid a
prænomen which it is clear neither
Shakespeare nor his early editors
affixed to the name by which he
is usually known. It is equally certain
that no other writer has ever
employed the term “Adam” in such
a way. In this state of the case, we
seem still left to seek the meaning of
the word “Abraham,” as thus used.
In order to exhibit the whole merits
of the question, let us subjoin the
note of Mr. Singer in reference to it,
and also that of Mr. Richard Grant
White, editor of an American edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of Shakespeare. Mr. Singer remarks:</p>

<p>“All the old copies read <i>Abraham</i>
Cupid. The alteration was proposed
by Mr. Upton. It evidently alludes
to the famous archer, Adam Bell. So
in Decker’s <i>Satiromastix</i>: ‘He shoots
his bolt but seldom, but, when Adam
lets go, he hits.’ ‘He shoots at thee,
too, Adam Bell; and his arrows stick
here.’ The ballad alluded to is
‘King Cophetua and the Beggar
Maid,’ or, as it is called in some copies,
‘The Song of a Beggar and a
King.’ It may be seen in the first
volume of Percy’s <i>Reliques of Ancient
Poetry</i>. The following stanza Shakespeare
had particularly in view:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">‘The <i>blinded</i> boy, that <i>shoots so trim</i>,<br />
From heaven down did hie;</p>
<p class="pp6i">He drew a dart, and shot at him,<br />
In place where he did lie.’”</p>
<p class="pr6">&mdash;<i>Singer’s Note.</i></p>

<p class="p1">Now, though it cannot be doubted
that Shakespeare had in mind <i>the
blinded boy that shoots so trim</i>, as set
forth in the ballad referred to, nor
that the expression “shot so trim”
grew out of it, yet this fact is far
from affording good reason for the
belief that he had also Adam Bell in
view, or that he had any thought of
conferring the Christian name of that
noted outlaw upon Cupid himself.
The presumption would be that however
<i>trim</i> a bowman that “belted forestere”
may have been, yet the skill
of Cupid in this respect is too preeminent
and well allowed, to admit
of any compliment or illustration derived
from the name of the very best
merely human archer who ever drew
cloth-yard shaft to ear. Mr. Singer
appears to us, therefore, to have
been misled by a merely superficial
analogy into too great confidence in
an improvident suggestion, when he
ventured to substitute a conjectural
emendation of the text for a reading
which was uniform in “all the old
copies.”</p>

<p>The note of Mr. White is as follows:</p>

<p>“Upton gave us the <i>Adam</i> which
takes the place of ‘Abraham’ in all the
current editions, except Mr. Knight’s.
But, as Mr. Dyce says, there is not
the slightest authority for the change.
The last-named gentleman conjectures
that ‘Abraham’ in this line is a
corruption of <i>Auburn</i>; as it is unquestionably
in the following passages
which he quotes:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">‘Where is the oldest sonne of Pryam,<br />
That Abraham coloured Troian? Dead.’</p>
<p class="pr6">&mdash;<i>Soliman and Perseda</i>, 1599, sig. H, 3.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">‘A goodlie, long, thicke Abram colored beard.’</p>
<p class="pr6">&mdash;<i>Middleton’s Blurt</i>, <i>Master-Constable</i>, 1602, sig. D.</p>

<p class="pn1">And in <i>Coriolanus</i>, act ii. sc. iii.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">‘Not that our heads are some browns, some blacke, some Abram,’</p>

<p class="pn1">as we read in the first three folios.</p>

<p>“The suggestion is more than plausible;
and we at least owe to Mr.
Dyce the efficient protection which
it must give to the original text.
Cupid is always represented by the
old painters as auburn-haired.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>But Mr. White, it will be observed,
begs the question as to the passages
quoted from other authors. These
passages simply prove that “Abraham
coloured” and “Abram colored,”
as applied to the hair and the
beard, were common enough expressions
at and before the time of
Shakespeare. Besides, only conceive
whether it would be characteristic of
Shakespeare to write so tamely as
“Young auburn Cupid”!</p>

<p>In fact, the term in question must
have had a pertinent, significant, and
peculiar meaning, well understood
by his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Knight conceives the term
<i>Abraham</i> to be thus appropriated
from the vagrants and beggars called
“Abraham-men,” who were too often
cheats;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and it is to be feared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
he thus means us to imply the propriety
of the appellation in this instance,
upon the ungallant hypothesis
that Cupid is himself the prince
and chief exemplar of deceivers in
general. But this specific characteristic
we have always understood to
belong to Mercury. For however,
popularly, Cupid is estimated as a
gay deceiver, Mercury was held by
the Greeks the god of fraud and
falsehood. The sailors have a phrase
of “shamming Abraham” when one
of the crew shirks his duty on pretence
of sickness or for any other
pretended excuse. No one seems to
have thought of the possible origin
of this proverbial expression, as used
in reference to the beggars from
whose habits it is evidently derived.
It has occurred to us that, since
Abraham was the father of the faithful,
that is, the person most eminent
for faith, his name may have been
thus taken up, in a manner savoring
more of wit than of reverence, in relation
to persons disposed to live
rather by <i>faith</i> than by <i>works</i>&mdash;in
fact, who showed the amplitude of
their trust in whatever might turn
up, oftentimes in a somewhat questionable
shape, by doing no work at
all. This would manifestly be a sort
of <i>shamming Abraham</i>.</p>

<p>But however this may be, since all
the old copies read <i>Abraham</i> Cupid,
and since the alteration of the text
commended by Mr. Singer and others
cannot be justified upon any
grounds which they offer, or in any
other mode, we must find some
means of explaining the phrase as it
stands, or remain in the dark as to
its true interpretation. Certainly the
matter is not at all cleared up by unauthorized
substitution. Against Mr.
Knight’s theory, on the other hand,
militates the plain fact that, in every
example cited, unless the one in controversy
be taken as an exception,
the word stands for a certain <i>color</i>,
and not as qualifying any moral characteristic,
or implying any personal
defect. There is a difficulty, besides,
in the <i>auburn</i> hypothesis which it
must be admitted is hard to get over.
Supposing the word had been found
written as it is, nowhere but in these
two passages of Shakespeare, it might,
perhaps, so pass muster. He might
not very unnaturally be thought to
have put such a corrupt form of the
word <i>auburn</i> purposely into the
mouth of the worthy citizen in <i>Coriolanus</i>;
and the term <i>auburn</i>, in
such a connection, but misprinted in
the course of time, might possibly
be considered not absolutely inconsistent
with the character of Mercutio
and the strain of his speech.
But when we find the same word
used by two other writers contemporary
with Shakespeare, both of
whom would be likely to know the
correct form and so to write it, if
“Abraham” or “Abram” were
merely a corrupt form of it, and especially
as in one of the examples
it occurs in a serious passage of a
tragedy&mdash;it seems much more probable
that the term “Abraham” itself,
as so applied, had its own distinct
and well-understood meaning, so familiar
as to excite, at that period, no
necessarily ludicrous association. And
that this term <i>Abraham</i> was a cant
phrase which had come into common
use is actually implied by the correspondent
expression in the preceding
line of this very speech of Mercutio:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Speak to my gossip, Venus, one fair word,<br />
One <i>nickname</i> for her purblind son and heir;<br />
Young <i>Abraham</i> Cupid, he that shot so trim.”</p>

<p class="p1">Now, it is obvious that <i>auburn</i>, as
being a common adjective, could
constitute no nickname; whereas
Abraham, as a noun proper, and at
the same time signifying a certain
color, serves that purpose completely,
as, for example, <i>Cicero</i>, or <i>Nasica</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>We must own that a passage in
Bishop Hall’s <i>Satires</i> at first a little
puzzled us, viz.:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“A lustie courtier whose curled head<br />
With <i>abron</i> locks was fairly furnished.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p class="p1">But upon reflection it will be found
that, although <i>abron</i>, at first sight,
looks much more like auburn than
does either <i>Abraham</i> or <i>Abram</i>, and
it might appear, therefore, to be, in
fact, a less corrupt form of that word
than either of the other terms, yet,
on the other hand, <i>abron</i> is itself both
in form and sound much nearer
<i>Abram</i> than it is to <i>auburn</i>, and may,
therefore, be only a misspelt variation
of the first rather than of the second
expression.</p>

<p>In this philological dilemma, we
believe we are able to throw a gleam
of light on the obscurity; and, though
the explanation is derived from a
source apparently remote, there is,
nevertheless, good ground for thinking
it may prove satisfactory. We
happen to have in our possession a
copy of the quarto edition of the
Latin Dictionary published at Cambridge,
England, in 1693, which is
the foundation of those dictionaries
of the Latin language in common
use which have succeeded it. The
word <i>vitex</i> is thus translated in it:
“A kind of withy or willow, commonly
called agnus castus, in English,
park-leaves, <i>Abraham’s balm</i>,
chaste or <i>hemp</i> tree.”</p>

<p>Now, it is no less certain than
melancholy to reflect upon that our
respected ancestry, like their descendants,
were compelled to supply
the loss of hair by some adventitious
covering, and that their periwigs
were sometimes perhaps commonly
manufactured out of either the
coarser or the finer filament of flax
or hemp, since those made of hair
were very costly. We are confident
we have read of a splendid and no
doubt full-bottomed article of the
latter material costing as much as
fifty guineas, a couple of centuries
ago.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> We speak of flax and hemp indiscriminately,
however botanically
different, as those predecessors of
ours were in the habit of doing, and
as being, in fact, used for similar
purposes, <i>e.g.</i>, “Except the flax or
hemp plant, and a few other plants,
there is very little herbage of any
sort.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>To the coarser filament of both,
after the article is heckled, is still, we
believe, applied the name of <i>tow</i>.
In either case, the substance, when
thus subjected to the nicer process
of manufacture, presents that well-known
whitish brown color so often
and so enthusiastically celebrated by
the elder English poets in the aspect
of “flaxen locks.” We do not know,
and, after considerable research, have
been unable to ascertain with accuracy,
what was the peculiar relation
of the “hemp-tree” to those other
vegetable productions; but infer from
the name that there was a certain resemblance
in the fibre of the one to
the others, and that probably to some
extent it was formerly used for similar
purposes. At any rate, it is only
with the name and the associations
it calls up that we have particularly
to do. If the hemp-tree, otherwise
called “Abraham’s balm,” furnished
when manufactured an article similar
in color to that of the other vegetable
productions referred to, a sufficient
foundation is laid for this inquiry.</p>

<p>Bosworth’s <i>Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon
Language</i> affords a striking
illustration of the general subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
He says that “flax signified, in
earlier times, also <i>hair</i> and all kinds
of hairy thread. In Austria, the flax
is called haar, hair. The Danish
hör signifies the same.” He adds:
“The Old English flix-<i>down</i>, soft
hair, is another instance that flax in
earlier ages was used to designate
hair.”</p>

<p>Of the metaphorical use of the
word the poets are full of pregnant
examples, for instance:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Her flaxen haire, insnaring all beholders,<br />
She next permits to wave about her shoulders.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“All flaxen was his poll.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Adown the shoulders of the heavenly fair<br />
In easy ringlets flowed her flaxen hair;<br />
And with a golden comb, in matchless grace,<br />
She taught each lock its most becoming place.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p class="p1">If to these examples we add the following
passage, we shall perceive
that the hue in question enjoyed a
special distinction and favor:</p>

<p>“The four colors signify the four
virtues; the <i>flaxey</i>, having a whiteness,
appertains to temperance, because
it makes <i>candidam et mundam
animam</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>And as this is a hue which frequently
distinguishes the heads of
youngsters, a large proportion of
whom, at an early period of life, we
know as <i>white-headed</i> urchins, and in
England as well as in the United
States even as <i>tow-heads</i>, we are
very strongly inclined to believe the
color and the term “Abraham” or
“Abram” to be thus derived from association,
and to be so applied to the
boy Cupid; the word <i>Abraham</i>, in this
connection, having come to express, to
a certain extent, the <i>tow</i>, or the color
of the tow, of <i>hemp</i>, or flax, or equally
of the finer part which remains
after the tow is combed out. So
that, in all probability, the cant term
“Abraham,” as thus applied in
Shakespeare’s day, meant precisely
the same as <i>flaxen</i>, with, perhaps, a
slightly humorous allusion. And in
this view of the case, we must put in
a <i>caveat</i> to the allegation of Mr.
White, that, if “Cupid is always represented
by the old painters as auburn-haired,”
then they have so depictured
him without sufficient authority;
indeed, in contradiction of
the best authorities; for the classical
evidence on this point will show his
hair to be described as of that color
which is usually known by the style
of “flaxen”; since auburn is really
a dun color, or “reddish brown,”
whereas Cupid’s hair was flaxen, or,
as we now say, blonde. For instance:</p>

<p>“The god of love was usually represented
as a plump-cheeked boy,
rosy and naked, with <i>light</i> hair floating
on his shoulders.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>“Eros is usually represented as a
roguish boy, plump-cheeked and naked,
with <i>light</i> hair floating on his
shoulders.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>We cannot but think, therefore,
that this manifest distinction of hue
effectually disposes of the theory that
“abron” stands for any misspelling
of <i>auburn</i>, as suggested by Mr. Dyce,
and adopted by Mr. White.</p>

<p>It appears, by the bye, that this
same <i>agnus castus</i>, or hemp-tree,
which has given occasion for these remarks,
was supposed from an early period
to possess some peculiar virtues,
which prompted its other appellation
of “The Chaste Tree”; and to this
circumstance was owing, doubtless,
its introduction by the poets in their
descriptions of various ceremonials.
Thus, Chaucer has three several references
to it in his “Floure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Leafe,” and very noticeably, as follows:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Some of laurer, and some full pleasantly<br />
Had chaplets of woodbind; and, sadly,<br />
Some of <i>agnus castus</i> weren also<br />
Chaplets fresh.”</p>

<p class="pn1">So Dryden, also, modernizing this
very passage of the older poet:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Of laurel some, of woodbine many more,<br />
And wreaths of <i>agnus castus</i> many bore.”</p>

<p class="p1">It ought to be suggested that the
statement herein made as to the earlier
practice of wearing wigs of flax
and tow, in addition to some direct
evidence to the point, is partly a matter
of inference, and partly due to
rather vague recollections of youthful
studies (to which we have not thought
it worth while to recur) among the
romance writers of the last century.
Their famous heroes undoubtedly
were more or less familiar
with “Abraham-men” and personages
of that description; and it
must be confessed that the impression
of the “tow-wigs” worn, for purposes
of disguise or with whatever
object, by the highwaymen, sturdy
beggars, and other worthies introduced
into their novels, is amongst the
strongest left on our mind by those
lucubrations of their genius.</p>

<p>The inference which we have ventured
upon is that, since wigs were
articles of supposed necessity, and
certainly have been used from early
times; and since those manufactured
of hair must have been much
more costly in former days than at
present, the probabilities are very
strong that this important description
of head-gear was made, more or less
commonly, out of that material which
still, we believe, affords the foundation
of those ingenious works of art,
the color and beauty of which furnished
the poets with an ordinary and
apt illustration of bright and flowing
locks.</p>

<p>We are not without testimony on
this point, however, and that, too, of
no less authority than Walter Scott,
which is literally to the point:</p>

<p>“The identical Peter wears a huge
great-coat, threadbare and patched.
His hair, half gray half black, escaped
in elf-locks around a huge wig
<i>made of tow</i>, as it seemed to me.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Addison also tells us, in a paper of
the <i>Spectator</i>, as quoted by Johnson:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“I bought a fine flaxen long wig.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is true, Dr. Johnson cites this
example in his <i>Dictionary</i> as only
meaning something “fair, long, and
flowing, as if made of flax”; but we
are far from thinking the qualification
of his definition inevitably correct,
any more than in some other
well-known instances. The great
lexicographer imagines a wig of hair
as presenting the appearance of one
made of flax; but we see no reason
why the excellent <i>Spectator</i> should
not be taken literally according to
his expression; nor why he may not
have appeared upon the occasion to
which he refers in a veritable wig of
flax, especially since such an object
of manufacture was common, could
be made to bear so close a resemblance
to hair, probably looked better,
and was of much less cost. We
find a still more decisive example in
the <i>Spectator</i>, which scarcely admits
of any other than the most literal interpretation:</p>

<p>“The greatest beau at our next
county sessions was dressed in a
most monstrous flaxen periwig that
was made in King William’s reign.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The following example is equally
pertinent:</p>

<p>“A fair, flaxen, full-bottomed periwig.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>In this instance, the word “fair”
would seem clearly to apply to the
color, and “flaxen” to the material,
for otherwise the use of both expressions
would be tautological.</p>

<p>Indeed, we have not left this matter
to conjecture and inference merely;
for we took occasion to inquire
upon this topic, several years ago, of
a late celebrated hair-dresser; and,
in fact, these notes have been kept
on hand for a period considerably
longer than the nine years prescribed
by Horace for the due refinement
and perfection of immortal verse.
Our excellent friend, M. Charrier, of
Boston, informed us that he had been
called upon to manufacture actual
wigs of the filament of flax; and he
remembered one particular occasion,
when an article of special beauty
was required for the use of a popular
actress, who was to perform in a
play which he thought was called
“The fair maid with the golden
locks.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Thus we trace the article
to the stage itself, and there, in all
probability, its construction of the
material in question is traditional,
and is much more likely to have originated
at a period earlier than the
time of Shakespeare than at a later
date. Of course, if M. Charrier had
lived to our day, he would have
found plenty of business in constructing
those mountainous piles of various
vegetable material with which
ladies now see fit to load their heads&mdash;“some
browne, some blacke, some
Abram.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>In corroboration of these views, explanatory,
we hope, of the strange
expression, Abraham Cupid, to modern
eyes and ears, we have just met
with a singularly apt illustration. A
very young lady of our family received
last Christmas, as a present, a
doll with a remarkable head of hair.
It was long, fine, profuse, admirably
curled, and exactly of that brilliantly
fair color, the lightest possible shade
of brown, sometimes but rarely seen
in its perfection on the heads of
young persons, and of the hue which
might well be imagined as a peculiar
and suitable attribute of the god of
love. An examination of this attractive
ornament to the seat of whatever
intellect a doll might be supposed to
possess showed at once, that it was
skilfully manufactured, doubtless by
accomplished French artisans, of the
filament of flax.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>From these premises the following
propositions seem to be fairly deducible:</p>

<p>1. That, in the time of Shakespeare,
the word <i>Abraham</i> was sometimes
employed as a cant term expressive
of a certain color.</p>

<p>2. That, since the name “Abraham’s
balm” was used for a certain
shrub or bush, otherwise called the
hemp-tree, the color in question was
probably that of dressed hemp or
flax, which nearly resembled each
other in hue; the word tow being
still applied to the coarse filament of
both.</p>

<p>3. That the color attributed to
“flaxen locks,” so celebrated through
the whole range of English poetry,
is, in fact, that light and fair, that is,
blonde, color of the hair assigned to
Cupid.</p>

<p>4. That “Young Abraham Cupid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>”
therefore, means nothing else than
<i>flaxen-haired</i> or <i>fair-haired</i> Cupid.</p>

<p>In regard to the term “Abraham’s
balm,” as applied to the hemp-tree,
we beg leave to suggest that such an
appellation may have been bestowed
on such a tree, as intimating a natural
and appropriate cure for such infirmities
as resulted in mistakes about
property, to which we may suppose
Abraham-men and their associates
were only too subject. The figure
may be thought similar to that highly
metaphorical expression conveyed
by the passage:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Ye shall have a hempen caudle, then.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p class="p1">As to “Abraham-men,” a rope
may, in fact, have been thought, in
extreme cases, a “<i>balm</i> for hurt
minds.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> stands girdled with its forty
thousand acres of forest, or gathering
of many palaces rather than a united
single one, and presents perhaps a
wider and more varied retrospect
than any of its historical compeers.
Poet, philosopher, and historian alike
find inexhaustible food for meditation
before the grand, irregular pile that
rises up before us with its towers and
gables massed against the sky&mdash;the
most elaborate epic ever written in
stone. But prior to the stupendous
poem that we behold to-day, an idyl
rose upon its site; a song, half sacred,
half sylvan, floats to us across the
distant tide of time, the record of an
undying past. A vast virgin forest
where the chant of prayer and penitence
mingles with the voicing of the
primeval choir of oaks, and sycamores,
and elms, and spire-like poplars,
ranged in many-octaved lyres
for the winds to strike with strong
melodic finger; and human souls set
up in the high places, higher than
forest trees or earth-built towers;
harps wooing the touch divine of the
Master’s hand, joining in the ecstatic
song of seraph praise; souls these
who have cast aside crowns of gold,
and trodden their purple garments
under foot, to choose the crown of
thorns and the scant robe of poverty&mdash;love
driven to the strange madness,
of the cross; others there are who
sing the deep plain-song of humility
and forgiven sin; while some, whose
snow-white brow the dark shadow of
sin has never crossed, carol forth in
innocent joy with the matins of the
lark the hymn of deliverance, the
psalm of praise and worship, of intercession
and thanksgiving&mdash;such is
the concert of celestial harmony that
echoes to us from the long-ago of the
grand old forest. Many changes,
will follow: we shall see a busy stir
of multitudinous life alternating with
the chill silence of the tomb; princes
and prelates hurrying to and fro,
noble matrons, and frail women, and
death in many forms, beautiful and
terrible, serene and tragic, passing
and repassing the gates; and we shall
hear the woods reverberating to other
sounds than those of prayer&mdash;to the
clanging of civil strife, to the voice
of laughter and of tears.</p>

<p>Distinct amidst all the earlier
memories of Fontainebleau stand
out the figures of S. Louis and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
mother, Blanche of Castille. There
are many versions as to the origin
of the place; the most popular one
records that S. Louis, being out hunting
one day, lost a favorite hound
called Bleau, and, after scouring the
forest in search of the truant, found
him at last quietly drinking at a
fountain, and was so enchanted with
the beauty of the surrounding scene
that he determined to build a hunting-lodge
on the spot; he did so, and, in
memory of the incident, it was named
Fontaine de Bleau. But this pretty
legend is rejected by the most reliable
historians, who have searched out
traces of a much earlier origin for
Fontainebleau. There seems sufficient
evidence of its having been used as
a royal residence by Hugh Capet,
and frequented as a favorite rendezvous
for the hunt by all the earlier
kings of France. The existence of
the famous monastery of S. Germain
l’Auxerre, at the western extremity
of the forest, is advanced as a proof,
and a strong one, of its being in those
remote times inhabited by royal
patrons, for monasteries sprang of
necessity where kings lived; and
there is no doubt that the greater portion
of the abbey lands were grants
from good King Robert. Blanche of
Castille retired to an old château of
some sort at Fontainebleau during
her husband’s absence while at war
with England or the Albigenses; she
founded in the neighborhood the
Abbaye de Lys, which was later on
munificently endowed by her son,
Louis IX., who even went the length
of giving up to it some acres of the
forest that he loved so well. It was
here that a great portion of his childhood
was passed. Under the shadow
of the old woods, or pacing the
solemn cloisters of the abbey, his
mother instilled into his mind those
first lessons of fear and love upon
which his life was so faithfully modelled.
“My son, I love thee dearly,
but, so help me God, I would rather
see thee dead at my feet than have
thee live to sully thy soul with one
mortal sin.” Truly, a valiant mother
of the Machabean mould&mdash;a woman
of strong faith, worthy to be the
mother of a Christian king.</p>

<p>When the child has grown to manhood,
we see him still at Fontainebleau,
holding his court of justice
under the broad shade of a giant
oak, he seated on the gnarled trunk,
while his people gathered round him&mdash;a
young patriarch settling the disputes
of his tribe, dealing out the
law; justice and mercy being counsel,
and judge, and jury, and the
king’s word supreme. Sometimes
we see him dashing through the
glade, followed by his courtiers, while
the merry hunting-horn scares the
wild birds from their nests, and rouses
the tusky boar in his lair; but more
frequently we see the king alone,
meditating on the frail tenure of
earthly joys and pride, or surrounded
by the wise and learned men, too
noble to be called courtiers, whose
society he enjoyed better than that
of youths of his own age. Louis
preserved through life a taste for the
monastic offices that he had joined
in habitually with Blanche de Castille
in his childhood; and, when he could
spare a few days from the cares of
his kingdom, he would spend them
in the prayerful solitude of the
monastery of the Mathurins, assisting
at all the offices with the monks, and
helping them in tending the sick and
teaching the poor. His young courtiers
made merry over this strange
pastime for a king, but Louis only
laughed, and said: “Let them
laugh, these young ones! It hurts
no one, and God is not offended. If
I spent my time in hunts, and tournaments,
and dancing, they would not
blame me. Let them laugh; pray God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
I may never give them cause to
weep!” Once S. Louis fell ill at
Fontainebleau, and, being considered
at the point of death, he called his
little son to him, and gave him some
touching advice concerning his conduct
and private life; then suddenly
changing his tone to one of great impetuosity,
he exclaimed: “I pray
thee, fair son, make thyself loved of
my people! for verily I had rather a
Scotchman came from Scotland to
govern the kingdom well and loyally
than that it should be unfairly or unkindly
governed by thee!”</p>

<p>Joinville, who was the close companion
of S. Louis through the most
active part of his career, finds no
words wherewith to praise adequately
the character and virtues of the king.
“What concerned himself alone
could never move him to joy or
wrath,” says this trustworthy chronicler;
“but when it touched the honor
of God, or the happiness of his
people, Louis knew no fear, and
brooked no delay, nor could any
earthly consideration hinder him in
the discharge of a duty.” Yet Joinville
censures his master severely for
having undertaken the second Crusade,
which he condemns as a great
military and political mistake. Had
it succeeded, however, Egypt would
have become a Christian colony, and
the cross would have been planted
on the pyramids; this was what S.
Louis looked to beyond the conquest
of Jerusalem; and, if his dream
had been realized, Joinville would
hardly have pronounced it a “great
mistake.”</p>

<p>A quaint anecdote is told of a trick
played by S. Louis to ensnare his
nobles into enlisting in this fatal expedition.
The court was at Fontainebleau
for the celebration of
Christmas. It was customary for the
king to present the courtiers with
furred cloaks called <i>liveries</i> to wear
at Midnight Mass on Christmas eve.
S. Louis had a great number of these
made, and gave orders that a cross
should be embroidered in dark silk
on the shoulder of each, and that
they should be distributed at the last
moment in a dimly lighted apartment;
this was done, according to
the king’s command; the courtiers
hurriedly donned their <i>liveries</i>, and it
was only when they entered the brilliantly
illuminated church that the
wearers beheld the symbol on each
other’s backs. They were at first
astonished and displeased, says Joinville,
but when the king came forward
with the cross on his own
shoulder and the crucifix in his hand,
and asked if they would tear theirs
off, and send him forth alone to the
Holy Land, a thrill of chivalrous ardor
ran through the assembly, and
all answered as one voice: “No; we
will follow you! We will keep the
cross!” And they did.</p>

<p>Blanche de Castille, whose religious
enthusiasm is rightly or wrongly
credited with the responsibility of
this ill-fated enterprise, held the regency
during her son’s absence, and
proved by her courage in confronting
the dangers and difficulties of the
charge, and by her wisdom and
counsel, that even in those unprogressive
days a wise and virtuous woman
made no bad substitute for a
man in the mighty task of government.
She spent most of her time
in the comparative retirement of
Fontainebleau; but when the news
came of the disastrous issue of Mansoorah,
where the Christian army
was cut to pieces, and the king with
his noblest captains taken prisoners,
she left it, and hastened to the capital,
in order to work more actively for
the ransom of her son and his brave
companions in arms. It was a terrible
time for a mother. The queen
knew that those who had taken her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
son captive had no power over his
soul; she knew that Louis was more
commanding in his chains than he
had even been at the head of his
armies; that adversity would teach
him no language unbecoming a
Christian prince; that neither threats
nor torture would wrench from him
any compromise unworthy of his
honor; and that captivity, nay, death,
in so august a cause was the most
enviable destiny she could have wished
him; but she was a human mother
withal, and in this hour of trial
her motherhood vindicated itself relentlessly.
Blanche labored day and
night to raise a ransom that might
tempt the Turk to give up his prize.
She heard that eight thousand <i>besants</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
would be accepted for the
king himself, and this sum was with
great difficulty mustered and sent to
Palestine. But when Louis heard it,
he sent word to the sultan that “the
King of France was not to be ransomed
with gold or silver; that he
would give the town of Damietta for
his own person, and eight thousand
<i>besants</i> for his army.” The offer was
rejected with scorn, and Louis was
subjected to still greater cruelties and
humiliations; but at last, worn out
by the indomitable heroism of his
victim, the sultan gave way; the regal
fortitude in which suffering had
clothed their captive had subdued
even his jailers into wondering admiration,
and they set him free, declaring
that “this king was the proudest
Christian that the East had ever
seen.” No sooner was he at liberty,
than, instead of hastening away from
the scenes of his misery and misfortunes,
Louis set to work to spread
the Gospel far and wide in Palestine;
but Blanche had earned a right to
clasp him to her heart after those
three years of separation. She felt,
too, that the days were growing short;
so she wrote, entreating him to come
home. S. Louis was repairing the ramparts
of Sidon when the summons
reached him; he immediately prepared
to obey it; but, before he had
left Sidon, the mother who, next to
God, had been the supreme love of
his life had taken her flight to a
better world. She died at Fontainebleau.
“He made great mourning
thereat,” says Sire de Joinville,
“that for two days no speech could
be gotten of him. After that he sent
a chamber-man to fetch me. When
I came before him in his chamber,
where he was alone, he stretched
forth his arms, and said to me, ‘O
seneschal! I have lost my mother.
My God, thou knowest that I loved
this mother better than all other
creatures, but thy will be done.
Blessed be thy name!’” Philip le
Bel (IV.) was born at Fontainebleau.
There are conflicting versions as to
the place of Philip’s death, but it is
generally supposed to have taken
place at Fontainebleau, in the same
room where he was born. There
was a current belief at the time, and
it was preserved through many succeeding
generations, that his death
was the result of a summons issued
against him by the grand master of
the templars, Jacques de Molai. A
hundred and thirteen templars perished
at the stake during Philip’s
reign, and these <i>autos-da-fe</i> were
crowned by that of the grand master,
who was burnt alive in the gardens
of his own palace. As the flames
rose round his naked body, the templar
lifted up his voice, and, in the
hearing of the vast multitude of spectators,
solemnly summoned Philip
“to meet him at the judgment-seat
in four months from that day.” The
death of the king precisely four
months from the day of De Molai’s
execution gave a sanction to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
credulity of the people, and the legend
passed into an historical occurrence.
The fact of the summons is
accepted; we can have no difficulty
in admitting its inevitable effect on
the mind of the individual against
whom it was sent forth. There was
a prevailing belief that a dying man
had the power to issue the formidable
command, and that obedience
was compulsory. Philip, whose passion
for gold had led him to confiscate
the treasures of the templars,
and then to calumniate and persecute
them in order to justify his own
spoliations, was haunted by the
words of De Molai. He grew sick,
and his illness, defying all the arts of
medicine, soon brought him to the
verge of death. Feeling that his
days were numbered, he begged to
be taken to Fontainebleau, that he
might gaze once more upon the home
of his happy childhood. On arriving
there, he sent for his children and his
friends, and took a sorrowful farewell
of them. “They entered the chamber
where the king was,” says Godefroid
de Paris, “and where there was
very little light. They asked him
how he felt, and he answered: ‘Ill in
body and in soul. I have put on
so many <i>tillages</i> and laid hands on so
much riches that I shall never be
absolved. Methinks I shall die to-night,
for I suffer grievous hurt from
the curses which pursue me.’” And
that same night he died (1314).</p>

<p>The sons of Philip frequented
Fontainebleau very faithfully. So
did Charles V.; but a veil of mist
hangs over the history of the castle
during the greater part of the XIVth
century. We only find it mentioned
now and then as a meeting-place for
the hunt of royal sportsmen. Isabeau
de Bavière honored it often
with her presence, and enlarged a
portion of the building. But the
romantic history of Fontainebleau
dates from Francis I. He was to it
what Louis XIV. was to Versailles.
It is customary amongst the admirers
of those two brilliant representatives
of French monarchy to set
them side by side, and compare their
characters and achievements. And
no doubt there are points of resemblance
between them, but it is difficult
to pursue the comparison much
below the surface. Louis XIV., as a
king, certainly has the best of it, and,
as a man, Francis seems to have had
all the vices without many of his
successor’s redeeming virtues. Louis
was dissipated, but he put a limit
to his dissipation: Francis knew
none; he exhausted the treasury by
his wanton prodigality and the army
by his senseless ambition; he burnt
La Provence, he broke his plighted
word to Charles V., and yet we hear
him spoken of as the rival of Bayard,
“sans peur et sans reproche.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>History passes strange verdicts
sometimes, but stranger still is the
blind credulity with which posterity
endorses them, and clings to them in
spite of the light that by degrees
pierces through the darkness, showing
up the idol or the monster,
stripped of masks and drapery, and
exposed in its nakedness, or clothed
with its own deeds, that make the
only garment it has a right to wear;
we acknowledge that we have been
worshipping a false standard, or
forswearing an honest one; but
we go on with a dogged tenacity
worshipping and forswearing still,
rather than forsake an old love or
renounce an old antipathy. There
are few personages in history who
have usurped this kind of worship
and held it more successfully than
Francis I. Fontainebleau is not,
however, the appropriate place for
challenging his claims to the applause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of posterity; here he is on his
vantage-ground; we see him at his
best, all his faults, if not obliterated,
mellowed in the blaze of borrowed
glory that encircles him; here he is
the graceful knight-errant, the magnificent
patron of art, and science,
and learning, surrounded by men of
genius, whom he treats as equals and
as friends; we forget his profligate
follies, his reckless waste of the kingdom’s
money and the kingdom’s
blood, when we see him petting Leonardo
da Vinci, doing the behests
and humoring the crotchets of the
cantankerous old genius so tenderly,
and bearing his unreasonable jealousy
and his reproaches like a chidden
child. It would go hard with
us to be severe on so lovable a scapegrace,
even if he were not the King
of France. Francis ought never to
come before us except in the midst
of his beloved artists. There he is
perfect. To Leonardo his demeanor
is especially touching. When the
proud old man, still in the zenith of
his fame, but stung by the coldness
of Leo X. and frightened by the rising
glory of Michael Angelo’s sun,
turned sulkily away from his native
land, Francis invited him to Fontainebleau,
received him with open
arms, and treated him like a prince
as he was of the true <i>right divine</i>
creation, and laid himself out to
console him and brighten the evening
of his days. The exile was
querulous from ill-health, as well
as soured by disappointment and
the ingratitude of the Medici; but
Francis bore with his temper and his
lamentations with the sweetness of a
woman; there was no tender gracefulness
that sympathy could devise
to cheer the old man’s spirit and
heal his aching pride that the king
had not recourse to; he would have
kept him at Fontainebleau, near his
own person, but Leonardo, who was
so fond of solitude and meditation
that he never married, “because the
clatter of a wife’s tongue would
have disturbed his thoughts,” could
not bear the gay bustle of the
court, and said he must go somewhere
to be quiet; so Francis gave
him a splendid suite of apartments in
the Château de Clou at Amboise.
He spent the remaining four years of
his life there, painting his celebrated
Mona Lisa, the most exquisitely finished
perhaps of all his works, and in
writing his treatise <i>Della Pittura</i>, a
book of great originality and learning,
written, like all Da Vinci’s
books, after the manner of the Eastern
manuscripts, from right to left&mdash;a
singularity which he adopted, it is
said, to foil the curiosity of those
around him, and prevent his brother
artists from discovering his secrets.
The king paid twelve thousand livres
for Mona Lisa&mdash;an unprecedented
sum for a work of art in those days.
When Leonardo was thought to be
near his end, Francis had him conveyed
to Fontainebleau that he
might watch over him himself and
be with him at the close.</p>

<p>On the morning of his death, when
the king came into the room, the
dying man tried to raise himself on
his couch to welcome him, but the
effort was too much; he sank forward,
and would have fallen but for
the timely arms that rescued him.
Francis laid the venerable old head
upon his breast, and there it lay till
Leonardo breathed his last.</p>

<p>The artist had been pursued for
months before his death by a morbid
terror of being buried alive, and had
implored Francis to let him be kept
three days before the coffin was
closed. The king complied with the
wish, and caused his friend to be
exposed with royal honors, and the
body laid in state for three days. He
was buried in the Church of S. Florentin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
near his own abode at Amboise.</p>

<p>Benvenuto Cellini is another shining
stone in the pedestal of Francis
I. Discontented with the recognition
that his genius met with at home, he
too was enticed from the blue skies
of Florence to the colder but more
genial atmosphere of Fontainebleau,
and was petted by the graceful king
only in a less degree than Da Vinci.
But Benvenuto, who knew so many
things, who excelled almost equally
as a poet, a sculptor, and a painter,
was lamentably ignorant in the art
of being a courtier. The Duchesse
d’Estampes was queen of the gay
palace of Armida, and all the great
men that frequented it bowed before
her; but this bold Florentine, who
had a dash of the brigand in his composition,
thought he might dispense
with her patronage, and refused to
do homage at the common shrine;
he knew that he had had the bad
luck to displease the haughty fair
one by his untutored manners from
the first, and, instead of trying to
conciliate, he determined to conquer
her. The duchess was a
liberal and enlightened patroness
of art, and seems to have merited
in some degree by her personal accomplishments
the flattering title
bestowed on her by one of her protégés
of “the most beautiful of
<i>savantes</i> and the most learned of
belles.” Her sway over Francis
rested, therefore, on something stronger
than the ephemeral tenure of mere
beauty; but, had it been otherwise,
what chance was there for Benvenuto
against the favorite of the king?
He, foolish mortal, braved her so far
as to ask the king direct, without
having recourse to her intervention,
for an order to cast a bronze statue
for the great gallery which was in
process of completion, and Francis
gave him the order, with carte-blanche
for the execution. The statue was
finished, and a day appointed for the
king to see it. This was a precious
opportunity for a woman’s vengeance;
the duchess knew that the
triumph of the artist depended altogether
on the first impression produced
on the king, and that the
triumph of the work depended mainly
on the light in which it was seen:
Cellini had named an hour when the
sun would pour in soft, full floods of
light down the gallery; and, long before
the appointed time, he was there,
watching every changing shadow
that it cast upon his statue, counting
the minutes impatiently, while his
friends and all the court flocked in to
assist at the king’s entrance, and witness
the triumph or the humiliation
of the sculptor. But the hour passed,
and another, and another, and there
was no sign of Francis; the sun was
gathering up its light, and speeding
away to the west, and the brown
twilight was creeping into the gallery.
Benvenuto grew nervous, then outrageous.
He paced up and down
before his Jupiter like a man gone
mad. Where was the king? Would
no one take pity on him to go
and call the king? But Benvenuto
knew full well that none
in that courtly crowd would be guilty
of so rash an act. Not even he himself
would dare to do it. He knew
whose fault it was that the king was
not forthcoming, and he gnashed his
teeth in savage but impotent rage.
But genius, like prophecy, has a ready
handmaid in inspiration. “Let fall
the curtains, and bring lights,” cried
the sculptor, with a sudden bound
from despair to triumph. The partisans
of the “<i>belle savante</i>” groaned,
and stood still; the friends of
Cellini flew to obey his orders. It
mattered not that they did not understand:
the master did. In less
time than it takes to tell, the gallery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
was illuminated from end to end;
lamps, torches, waxlights, every luminary
that hands could carry, was put
in requisition, till Jupiter shone out
magnificent, terrible, and dazzling in
the blaze of an impromptu illumination
more weirdly effective than the
brightest daylight could have been.</p>

<p>Cellini’s spirit rose to frenzy. He
ran hither and thither, arranging the
lights with a view to more striking
effect; clustering many flames in a
group at one point, leaving another
in partial shade; clapping his hands
in wild delight one minute, impatiently
knocking down one of his helpmates
the next. It was finished. The
king was heard approaching. Cellini,
with an imperious gesture, commanded
silence; the doors of the gallery
were thrown open, and the colossal
bronze god flashed out in all his dark
effulgence on the astonished and enchanted
gaze of the monarch. The
triumph of the hour was complete;
but it cost the sculptor dear. The
duchess gave Francis no peace till
he quarrelled with her enemy, and
dismissed him from the court.</p>

<p>Many Italian artists had followed
Leonardo da Vinci to France, some
out of love for the great master himself,
others tempted by the generosity
which the King of France showed
universally to their class. The most
distinguished of these disciples of
Leonardo was Andrea del Sarto.
But he was of too restless a disposition
to settle anywhere permanently;
camp, court, and studio alike wearied
him after a time; his wings were too
buoyant to remain long folded even
in the enchanted clime of Fontainebleau;
he was not more than a year
there, when he declared it was a necessity
of life for him to return to
Florence, the ostensible motive being
to see his wife. Francis proposed to
send for her, promising that she
should be made welcome to his
court as an honored guest; but Andrea
said this would not do: he must
go himself and fetch her. All the
king could obtain was a promise that
he would return to France in a year;
and, to make the promise more binding,
he entrusted him with a considerable
sum of money, to be expended,
according to Andrea’s taste
and judgment, on objects of art for
the decoration of the palace. But
when Andrea found himself once
more in Florence, in the company of
his wife and his former boon companions,
he forgot all about his mission,
and spent the king’s money in
merry-making; he did not dare show
himself at Fontainebleau after this,
but frittered away the rest of his life
in his native city, where he eventually
died in poverty and contempt.
It would take too long to enumerate
the various European celebrities who
fill up the brilliant picture presented
by Francis’ court at this period; but
we cannot refuse a passing mention
to Serlio, the accomplished Bolognese
architect, whom the king lured away
from Italy by his gold and his honeyed
flattery. Serlio rebuilt the palace
almost entirely; his genius was
allowed full scope, and the result
justified the confidence of his patron.</p>

<p>The area of the old building being
much too small for the magnificent
new plan, Francis bought in the
Mathurin Convent and the noble
grounds with which Louis IX. had
endowed it, and added them to the
original site. The design of the
library had been sketched by S. Louis,
and this Serlio adhered to strictly,
making no change of his own.
When the edifice was finished, Francis
swept Italy and Spain for artists
to adorn and beautify it. Rosso
came to paint the walls in fresco, and
his design for the grand gallery,
which was to be called the Gallery
of Francis I., carried the prize over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
all his competitors; he embellished
it with paintings, friezes of great
beauty, and rich stucco-work. So
delighted was the king with the result
of Rosso’s labors that, in addition
to other favors, he created him
a canon of the Sainte Chapelle.
This wonderful gallery had sixteen
frescoes representing the most remarkable
incidents in the life of
Francis; the famous <i>porte dorée</i><a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
was decorated by the same gifted
hand. It is lamentable to think
that these glorious works of art,
which formed Rosso’s principal claim
on the admiration of the world, were
sacrificed to the vindictive jealousy
of a rival. Francesco Pellegrini had
been the early friend of Rosso; but,
when they met as fellow-laborers at
Fontainebleau, the friendship turned
to a rivalry which soon developed
into bitter enmity, and ended in the
tragic death of Rosso. Primaticcio,
as Pellegrini is usually called, was accused
by his rival of having stolen a
large sum of money from him; he was
put to the torture, but acquitted triumphantly.
Rosso was then seized
with shame and remorse; haunted
in imagination by the shrieks of the
innocent man, the friend of his youth,
whom he had given up to the torture,
his mind gave way, and in a fit
of insanity he took poison, which
killed him in a few hours. Some
say that Rosso knew that the accusation
was false, and that he brought it
designedly against Primaticcio, hoping
to get rid of him; but his frantic
grief on discovering his mistake,
and the fatal consequences of his remorse,
may be taken as contradictory
evidence of this opinion. Primaticcio,
moreover, by his subsequent
conduct, vindicates his unhappy
rival from having done him so very
great a wrong in suspecting him capable
of the theft, for he unblushingly
stole from Rosso what was incomparably
more precious to him than
gold&mdash;his fame. No sooner was he
master of the field, than he set about
to destroy all traces of Rosso’s beautiful
compositions, pulling down the
walls which they adorned, under pretence
of enlarging the space. Some
few that were spared by the relentless
destroyer have been obliterated
by damp and the effects of time.
There is one fine painting of his to
be seen in the Louvre&mdash;“Mary receiving
the homage of S. Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>The fêtes given at Fontainebleau
by Francis I., though perhaps inferior
in splendor to those of
Louis XIV. at Versailles, surpassed
them in picturesque elegance; they
were rather the ideal festivities of an
artist than the gorgeous pageants of
an Arabian caliph. But the leisures
of Francis were not all wasted in
frivolous amusements. In his sane
moments, when he was not flying
after that will-o’-the-wisp that cost
France and him so dear, the conquest
of the Milanese, he was something
more than the mere fascinating
madcap that his enemies make him
out; for it is his lot, like that of all
charming but unprincipled sovereigns,
to inspire panegyrics and denunciations
equally exaggerated. He was
not only a patron of those artists who
contributed to the adornment of his
dwellings: Francis courted the society
of learned men for learning’s sake.
The luxurious repasts of Fontainebleau
were enlivened and refined by
the presence of such men as Clement
Marot, whose style, full of terseness
and incisive grace, the king was fond
of emulating in verses of his own
composition, not altogether devoid
of poetic merit. He delighted in the
chivalrous lays of the middle ages,
and in the harmonious cadence and
florid imagery of the ballads of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
troubadours. The witty Curé of
Mendon was a frequent guest at the
royal table, Francis provoking his
lively sallies, and heartily enjoying
them, though the sarcasm was often
boldly pointed at himself. Learned
men of every class&mdash;doctors, bookworms,
and even printers&mdash;were admitted
to the same honor. Erasmus
was one of the few who withstood the
wiles of the charmer; he steadfastly
refused all invitations to reside permanently
at Fontainebleau; but he
kept up a brisk correspondence with
Francis, the honest freedom of whose
tone throughout does equal honor to
the scholar and the king. The French
court was, in fact, the most polished
and the gayest in Europe at this
period. The sprightly Queen of Navarre&mdash;that
sister whom Francis so tenderly
loved, his “Marguerite des Marguerites”&mdash;was
its presiding genius
and brightest ornament. She was
passionately fond of Fontainebleau,
and made it her home during the
greater part of her first husband’s
life, and after her marriage with
Henri de Navarre, who was so frequently
absent, either in her brother’s
service or in the pursuit of war on
his own account. Her image is
everywhere associated in our memory
with that of Francis in his favorite
palace. In her boudoir, a spacious
and magnificently decorated room,
leading out of Rosso’s noble gallery,
the royal brother and sister passed
many delightful hours, either in affectionate
converse together, or surrounded
by the artists and learned
men whom they both loved to honor.
Here Francis placed the library of
rare books and manuscripts for which
he had scoured Italy, Spain, and
Greece. The erudite Erasmus would
sometimes deliver one of his learned
discourses on deep and elevating
themes in the privacy of this enchanting
retreat, while Marguerite de Navarre
worked out, in rainbow-tinted
silks and golden threads, the poem
of one of her artist friends, or some
chivalrous exploit of her idolized
Francis. Happy had it been for
Francis and for France had he dwelt
content amidst the peaceful and refined
delights of this Eldorado. But
there was the Milanese&mdash;that unlucky
Milanese, the bane of his life, and of
his people’s while his lasted. Again
and again he flew at it like a moth at
the flame, or a madman at his <i>idée
fixe</i>&mdash;failure and humiliation, instead
of disgusting him with his hobby,
only goaded him to its pursuit with
greater zest. And what odd, shifting
relations grew out of this standing
duel between him and Charles V.!
Alternately, they were rivals, friends,
deadly foes, and “dear brothers.”
Beside the gloomy, vindictive Spanish
warrior, subtle in his policy, swift and
ruthless in his vengeance, the brilliant
figure of Francis shone at its
best; he had all the qualities that his
rival lacked; his uncalculating generosity,
his rash impulses that led him
into so many grievous straits, all
stand out in bright relief against the
dark background of the contest.
The story of the broken Treaty of
Madrid is one of the many vexed
questions over which the apologists
of both princes have broken innumerable
lances, but they leave it pretty
much where it stood in the year of
grace 1527, after the Notables decided
that the conditions of the treaty
were monstrous, and had been unjustifiably
imposed by a jailer on his
prisoner, and that Francis was right
in maintaining <i>que prisonnier gardé
n’est tenu a nulle foye, n’y se peut obliger
à rien</i>.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Charles had no right to exact the
abdication of his conquered foe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the latter had no power to effect it
without the consent of his Notables,
which he knew full well would never
be granted. Still, the solemn oath
sworn on the crucifix by Francis in
presence of the emperor is not to be
disposed of so easily. It would
have been more consistent with the
character for Bayard-like chivalry,
which the French prince arrogated,
to have withheld the pledge which he
knew he could not redeem, than to
purchase his liberty by a subterfuge
that has left an equivocal mark upon
his memory. He was only a lifetenant
of the crown of France; he
might resign it, but he had no power
to alienate its most insignificant fief;
in swearing, therefore, to hand over
the duchy of Burgundy and the
counties of Flanders and Artois to
Charles V., he was performing a vain
sham; for, had he been willing to carry
out the promise of renunciation
himself, he was well aware that the
states-general and the parliament of
the realm would never ratify the act,
and that without their ratification it
remained null and void. The strong
epithets used by Charles in denouncing
the disloyalty of his quondam
captive in violating this preposterous
treaty are, however, somewhat misplaced,
considering the duplicity and
cruelty which he himself had displayed
in extracting impossible concessions
from a brave and conquered foe.</p>

<p>It was not long before Francis
had an opportunity of vindicating
his much-prized character for chivalrous
magnanimity by heaping coals
of fire on the head of Charles. The
emperor was on his way to Ghent,
and applied to the king for a safe-conduct
through his dominions. It
was granted at once, but on condition
that the emperor should remain
for a few days the guest of Francis.
Charles was in such a hurry to castigate
the rebels that he would have
promised more than this in order to
arrive swiftly on the scene of vengeance;
he consented to halt at
Fontainebleau; but no sooner had
he set foot on the soil of his “good
brother of France,” than he was seized
with tremors and suspicions that
made his life miserable; he accused
himself of madness in having so
rashly rushed into the arms of a
prince whom he had persecuted
meanly when he was in his power,
and whose state he had grievously
injured; nor did the magnificence of
the reception which greeted him on
his arrival calm his fears. Francis,
who was utterly incapable of a base
breach of hospitality, could not forego
the pleasure of playing a little on
the agonies of Charles; he occasionally
repeated to him the murmurings
of the Queen of Navarre and the
Dauphin, who would fain have improved
the rare opportunity by compelling
their guest to undo some of the
mischief he had done their brother
and father. Francis even recounted
to the emperor with great merriment
an epigrammatic little passage between
himself and his favorite dwarf,
Triboulet: while the latter was diverting
the king with his usual antics on
the night of the Spaniard’s arrival,
he suddenly pulled out his tablets, and
began to write with an air of great
gravity. “What are you writing
there, Triboulet?” inquired his master.
“The name of a bigger fool
than myself,” replied the dwarf.
“Who is that?” said Francis.
“Charles,” replied Triboulet. “But
suppose I keep my word, and let him
go?” queried the king. “Then,”
answered Triboulet, “I would rub
out Charles, and write Francis instead.”</p>

<p>The question of the Milanese was
discussed between the two sovereigns
during this period with great earnestness
on one side and consummate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
skill on the other. Charles promised
solemnly to bestow the investiture

urged him to confirm his pledge by
a written guarantee, he cunningly
retaliated his host’s answer concerning
the Treaty of Madrid: “<i>Prisonnier

<p class="pc1">THIRD ARTICLE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> a former notice, we expressed an
intention to present our readers with
the translation of certain curious fragments
relating to Merlin; to be followed
by some of the historical
poems which succeeded the Druidic
compositions of earlier times. We
proceed to fulfil our promise.</p>

<p>The name of Merlin (Myrrdhin, or
Marzin) is so closely associated with
the early mystic and mythological
poetry of Cambria and Armorica
that it will be desirable to give some
account of this personage, as far as
the uncertainty of his history renders
it possible to do so, before reproducing
any of the poems of which he is
the subject.</p>

<p>It has long been supposed that
there existed two Merlins, one of
whom, a magician, was the offspring
of a Christian virgin and a Roman
consul who lived in the Vth century,
in the reign of Ambrose Aurelian;
or, according to the popular tradition,
whose father was no mortal, but a
malignant <i>Duz</i>, whom, under the
form of a bird, she unwittingly let in
at her window: and the other, a
warrior and bard, who after the battle
of Arderiz, in which he had unintentionally
killed his nephew, lost his
reason, and retired from the world.</p>

<p>But critics of the present day agree
in considering that it is one person
who is the subject of a triple tradition,
and that it is the same Merlin who
appears in the light of a mythological,
historical, and legendary hero.</p>

<p>The fragments which still remain
in Wales of the poems of this bard
are either very much modernized or
almost wholly transformed. Of the
ballads relating to him which exist
in Brittany, there seem to be four
principal ones. First, a cradle-song,
intensely pagan in spirit, in which
his mother plaintively relates to him
his mysterious origin while rocking
him to sleep, and when, to her amazement,
the infant derides her regrets,
and defends his father, declaring himself
to be born to be the good genius
of the Breton nation. This poem it
is needless to reproduce. We give
translations of the remaining three,
beginning with</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">MERLIN THE WIZARD.</p>

<p class="pc1">(<span class="smcap">Marzin Divinour.</span>)</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">VTH CENTURY.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Merlin, sage Merlin, say, whither away,<br />
With your Black Dog, at the dawn of the day?”<br />
“Seeking am I, in each wave-hollowed cleft,<br />
Egg red as blood, by the sea-adder left.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Cress I would seek in the meadowland low,<br />
Magical gold-herb, and weird mistletoe;<br />
Deep in the forest to find must I go,<br />
Where by the fay-haunted fount it doth grow.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Merlin, sage Merlin, your steps, ah, retrace!<br />
Mistletoe leave, the old oak-tree to grace;<br />
Leave the green cress and the gold-herb to grow,<br />
Hid in the well-watered meadowland low.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Leave the red egg of the snake of the sea<br />
Mid the wild foam of the breakers to be.<br />
Merlin! turn back from the path you have trod,<br />
One and the only Diviner is God!”</p>

<p class="p1">The latter half of the poem appears
to be the voice of S. Kado, the
Christian bishop to whom tradition
attributes the conversion of Merlin.</p>

<p>The gold-herb figures as one of
the most approved charms of Druidic
days. It is said to sparkle at a distance
like gold&mdash;whence its name&mdash;and
is greatly esteemed by the Bretons
for its medicinal qualities. It must
be gathered at dawn, by a person
who is in a state of grace, fasting,
barefoot, and clad in white linen
which has not been previously worn.
A circle is traced round it, and no
steel must approach it, but it must
be carefully plucked by the hand.
Should any one chance to tread upon
the plant, he sleeps forthwith, and
can hear and understand the language
of animals and birds.</p>

<p>In the next poem, Merlin no longer
appears as a magician. He is
himself overcome by a sorceress, who,
after depriving him of his harp and his
gold ring, the symbols of his dignity
as bard, takes advantage of a particular
taste he seems to have had
for apples (if we may judge by the
praises lavished upon that fruit in
poems of his composition still extant
in Wales<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>) to ensnare him, and to
make even his will powerless by their
means.</p>

<p>The tradition of his disappearance
is common to Wales and Brittany.
“The tomb of Merlin is known to
none,” says the bard Myvyrian, who
lived before the Xth century. And
in the Welsh Triads<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> it is written that
“he embarked with nine other bards,
and whither he went cannot be
known.” He himself says that he
fled from the court to dwell in the
woods.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The king mentioned in the ballad
appears to be Budik, chief of the
Bretons of Armorica, a British prince
who emigrated from Cornwall, and
who was a valiant defender of the
independence of Brittany against the
Franks. He was assassinated by
order of Clovis, who had been unable
to overcome him in battle,
about the year 506. He married his
daughter Alienor to a prince whose
name is unknown, and gave her
Léon for dowry.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">A blow upon the table thrice,<br />
That all the field might hear:</p>

With voice both loud and clear,</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Thus spake the king: “So bring thou me<br />

Behold, the king his word hath broken!”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Nay, fret thee not: there is small need;<br />
Only, to that I bid, give heed:<br />
My little coffer open thou,<br />
And take thereout a slender bough,<br />
Whereon twelve glittering leaflets grow:<br />
Like fiery gold they gleam and glow.<br />
‘Tis now full seven years agone<br />
Since seven woods I searched, alone,<br />
On seven nights, at darkest hour,<br />
Ere I could win that plant of power.<br />
When you the midnight cock-crow hear,<br />
Your red horse waits: speed forth, nor fear:<br />
In slumber deep will Merlin be;<br />
So fear thee not: good speed to thee!”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">When loud the cock at midnight crowed,<br />
The red steed bounded on the road;<br />

The old man and his son.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Anon the king returns, and still<br />
The two are at his side:</p>
<p class="pp6i">And thus he spake; “‘Tis true, my son,<br />
That thou hast gained thy bride;</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Yet is there one adventure more<br />
Which thou must undertake;</p>
<p class="pp6i">When that is sped, my son-in-law<br />

Bareheaded and barefooted? Say;<br />

Thy holly staff can barely stay<br />
Thy bending form, thou Druid gray.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Alas! To seek my harp I go:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span><br />
Best solace that my heart can know<br />
In this world. I am wandering<br />
To seek my harp, to seek my ring:<br />
Both have I lost: no more I sing,<br />

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c257" name="c257">“FOR BETTER&mdash;FOR WORSE.”</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> mother of a family of three
children sits musing while she mends
their clothing which lies heaped upon
a table beside her. The pile has
lowered slowly under her patient and
busy fingers during the long afternoon.
The slanting sun now shines
across her bowed head while she still
continues her work. It touches up
the homely furniture of the room
with a glow richer than the gilding
of art, and lends to the place a
cheerful aspect which does not accord
with the mood of its occupant. She
is a woman of about twenty-four
years, with considerable claim to
beauty in her regular features and
dark, intelligent eyes. But there is a
look of discontent on her face, and a
querulousness in her voice, as she
occasionally reproves the noisy children
playing about her. Yet the
eyes wear a patient look, in spite of
the discontent expressed, and a sort
of hushed resolve seems stamped
upon her features, as if, whatever is the
trouble with which she battles, no
acknowledged recognition of it shall
find vent. Nature, however, has her
way, and that which the voice refuses
to utter the eye often betrays, and
there will be found lines written upon
the human face which those who
study physiognomy may translate.
It is the chirography of the soul.
She writes upon the face as upon a
tablet, often also extending the characters
to the whole of the frail temple
she occupies, leaving her traces in
motions of the hands, carriage of the
head, the very posture of the body,
and in the gait, so that all are
eloquent of her subtle influence.
How often a pure pious soul, dwelling
on heavenly things, recoiling from
grossness, and courting all that is
divine, praying fervently always not
to be led into temptation, but delivered
from evil, glorifies a plain face
into a seraphic beauty which makes
the beholder wonder whence comes
this loveliness! We see plain features.
We wonder that this face should
please as much as it does, forgetting
the soul’s high mission. We see not
the lamp behind the screen of flesh:
we only see the effect of the rays.
Again, we see faces where nature has
done much to beautify, and where a
soul not delivered from evil has
written such ugly marks that the fair
tablet is disfigured with blots and
stains of sinful ink flowing from the
pen held in the grasp of passion.</p>

<p>Whence comes the writing on the
face of this mother sitting in the
golden sunshine, doing the work
which mothers are usually content to
perform? She is striving as best she
may with a lot in life distasteful to
her, but from which she sees no means
of escaping, and, indeed, as yet does
not dream of trying to escape. This
lot is that of being married to a man
of coarser nature than her own, who
seldom sympathizes with her in anything
at all above the most grovelling
interests. Why she married him
seems to her now an ever-unsolved
puzzle, a never-ceasing source of regret.
If she had read the lines, she
might conclude with the poet that it
was “accident&mdash;blind contact and the
strong necessity of loving.” Not
being acquainted with that answer to
her riddle, she blames fate and her
own inexperienced youth, and the
need of a home and protection at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
time when her own heart had not yet
asserted its rights. Now, she knows
she does not love her husband, and
she thinks she hates him at times.
Not that he is cruel, not that he is
unfaithful&mdash;he is neither of these;
but he is narrow, jealous, exacting,
unintellectual, and coarse; while she
is aspiring, even poetic, in her nature.
Fond of the beautiful, seeking it in
every way, cultivating her intellect
as best she can against the odds of a
deficient education, limited means
and time, and overtaxed strength of
body, she longs for a better position
in life. Care has fretted, if not furrowed,
her fair white forehead
already; yet still she reaches out
and clings to every refining influence.
All books that have fallen
in her way she has read, stealing the
time from toiling hours already filled
to overflowing with household work.
On this particular afternoon, there
lies among the stockings she is mending
a poem of Whittier’s, which has
taken such a hold upon her fancy and
morbid feeling that the discontent
deepens and the hunger of her starving
heart gnaws more sharply than
usual. This poem, <i>Maud Muller</i>,
read so gaily by the happy many,
with pleasure at its pretty conceits,
allies itself so to this woman’s experience
that it finds an echo she cannot
silence, in the lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“She wedded a man unlearned and poor,<br />
And many children played round her door;<br />
But care and sorrow and childbirth pain<br />
Left their traces on heart and brain.”</p>

<p class="p1">Although she has never had any
other lover, or even a passing fancy
for any other man, save some vague
ideal of some one different from her
husband John Thorndyke, as she
reads:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“And for him who sat by the chimney lug,<br />
Dozing and grumbling o’er pipe and mug,<br />
A manly form by her side she saw,<br />
And joy was duty, and love was law,”</p>

<p class="pn1">she seems to herself the heroine
of the poem, and John Thorndyke
the very unpleasant companion portrayed.
And yet no thought of escaping
from what she considers her
“shackles” obtrudes upon her musings.
She is a severe Puritan in her
education and faith, and thus far has
escaped the base free-thinking and
“free-love” tendencies of the day.
Marriage, disagreeable as it has proved
to her, seems still, if not a sacrament,
a binding, honorable state, to
be borne with according to her promise,
“for better or for worse.” She
has been married by an Episcopal
clergyman, because it had been most
convenient, and her husband had preferred
that form; and thus her spoken
promise has always seemed to her yet
more definite. “For better for worse,
for richer for poorer, in sickness and
in health, to love, cherish, and to obey,
till death us do part.” That sounds
always to her like a doom. Joy is
not duty, and love is not law, in her
case; but she patiently takes “up her
burden of life again, saying only, ‘It
might have been.’”</p>

<p>But in her lonely heart, she has one
pure God-given instinct to glorify
her otherwise gloomy religion, and
ennoble her dull, hard lot. This is
charity in its loveliest form&mdash;a disposition
for nursing the sick and attending
to the needy&mdash;a positive vocation
for the work, which she does from enthusiasm,
not from cold duty. Ever
her willing hands minister to the suffering,
and often is she called to watch
through lonely nights at their bedsides.
In this way, her acquaintance
has extended far beyond her husband’s
sphere of life. Often in the
houses of her neighbors, both rich
and poor, are her skill and kindness
called into requisition. Tact and
cleverness, and, above all, a willingness
to help in time of need, soon
make a woman appreciated and respected
among those by whom she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
surrounded, and so it happens that
her own life presents itself to her in
sharper contrast with the lives of
other women.</p>

<p>That unsatisfied hunger at her
heart gnaws more and more, and
her husband grows to her more and
more repulsive; but while he repels
her thus, and every tendril of her
nature reaches out vainly for supporting
strength, she fails not in any duty
as wife and mother. While her heart
calls vainly, her conscience is answered
and obeyed in every exaction.
Courting no admiration from others,
even where willing tribute is paid to
her beauty and refinement; dressing in
Quaker-like simplicity, not only in accordance
with her limited means, but
her own severe taste; leading a quiet,
industrious life, Agnes Thorndyke is
irreproachable, and esteemed by all
who know her. The serpent coiled
down in the shadows of her soul is
waiting to rear its head&mdash;waiting for
an evil hand, an evil breath, to warm
it into strength, that its venom may
poison this pure life.</p>

<p>That evil hand, that evil breath,
are coming, as they are always sure
to come&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“When such thoughts do not come of themselves<br />
To the heart of a woman neglected, like elves<br />
That seek lonely places&mdash;there rarely is wanting<br />
Some voice at her side, with an evil enchanting<br />
To conjure them to her.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Deliver us from evil.” How
well our Lord knew the need of
that petition for us! How wise the
church to require its frequent use!
It is the cry of the direst human
need, in its last extremity, to its last
refuge. How will the evil come to
Agnes Thorndyke? and how will she
be led into temptation? The gate
is opened apparently by her very virtues.
While she sits brooding over
the thoughts which Whittier’s pretty
poem has suggested, her attention is
aroused by a loud cry, and noise of
clattering hoofs and wheels. Running
to the window, she sees a crowd
around a gentleman who lies bruised
and senseless before her door, while
a horse and shattered carriage are fast
disappearing down the street. Standing
on her porch, elevated above the
heads of the little crowd, she perceives
that the stranger is not killed,
but that he must be cared for instantly.
She calls to the men to bear
him within her open door, that she
may assist to dress his wounds, while
a surgeon is summoned. This she
does so deftly and so gently that the
sufferer thanks her warmly, and the
surgeon compliments her on her
skill.</p>

<p>The man is not very dangerously
hurt, but the doctor advises that he
be kept very quiet for a time. At
this the stranger looks perplexed, and,
casting first a searching glance about
the room and over the person of
Mrs. Thorndyke, he says:</p>

<p>“If I could be allowed to remain
here for any remuneration which this
lady would consent to receive, I
would pay it willingly, and also consider
it a great favor. I am a stranger
in the place. I had finished the business
for which I came, and I was
hurrying to the railway station, when
this unlucky accident befell me, and
threw me upon your kindness.”</p>

<p>He looks now at Mrs. Thorndyke.
She does not speak immediately, but
seems to be considering the expediency
of yielding to his request.
Her quick sympathy shows her at
once that it will be best for him not
to be disturbed.</p>

<p>“If you cannot consent, Mrs.
Thorndyke,” says the doctor, “he
had better be removed to the hotel
above here.”</p>

<p>“Pray, no!” interposes the patient.
“I came from there, and glad enough
I was to leave it. It is a noisy, dirty,
wretched place. Can’t you think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
some better refuge than that?&mdash;if I
may not stay here.”</p>

<p>There is peevishness in his tones
while speaking to the doctor which
soften to a gentle pleading as he
turns at the last words again to his
hostess. It is not lost upon her.
She is touched by his evident desire
to stay, and equally evident need of
quiet and rest.</p>

<p>“If my husband does not object
when he returns,” she says, “I will
undertake to be your nurse; but I am
afraid our plain house and ways will
hardly satisfy you when you are
stronger.”</p>

<p>“Oh! thanks&mdash;a thousand thanks,”
he replies; “no danger of any fastidiousness
of mine standing in the way
of my gratitude and content.”</p>

<p>And so it is arranged; for the pecuniary
help which the stranger offers
is not unwelcome to John Thorndyke
in the growing needs of his
family.</p>

<p>This stranger, Martin Vanderlyn,
is a handsome man of thirty-five
years, with the kind of beauty and
manner which takes captive the fancy
of many women, yet which is really
satanic; hard and cruel gray eyes,
but capable of a soft, imploring expression;
dark hair; pale, clear skin;
and tall, well-knit figure; a voice
agreeable in most of its cadences,
but with a treacherous note occasionally
grating on the ear, though corrected
quickly, as if he himself had
felt it; inherent strength, but not
purity of purpose; persistent patience
in executing his own selfish and sensual
will; apparent gentleness, and
refinement, and culture, made subservient
to his own desires; poetry,
and flattery, and irreligion, and sophistry
always on his lips and in his
eyes&mdash;such is the patient which it
becomes Agnes Thorndyke’s loving
task to nurse day after day. In this
dangerous companionship, this hungry
heart finds solace. “Lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil,” should be her constant
prayer now. How can she help seeing
his admiring eyes follow her, and
look into her own? How can she
prevent the dangerous familiarity
sanctioned by their relative positions
of nurse and patient? Well he
knows how to increase the ever-ready
sympathy for his sufferings. Soon
and easily he reads the disappointment
in her life, and detects the cause.
Is there no scruple of conscience, no
emotion of gratitude, to stay him in
his bad designs, framed and nursed
on his sick-bed during the very time
she so tenderly cares for him? Not
one. Day by day he weaves the net
and casts the toils about her so surely
that her whole manner towards
her husband has changed to a querulousness
and impatience which speedily
provoke a response of the same
nature; and discord and hatred sit
in the place where once reigned duty
and peace.</p>

<p>John Thorndyke, although of a
heavy, is also of a spiteful and jealous,
temperament. He has been, in his
dull way, proud of his wife, and selfishly
pleased at the comfort she has
brought him. It has not occurred to
him to try to brighten her life. Indeed,
he has not known that her life
needed any cheer. He thinks that
she is his, and all her duty is to him,
and so long as he knows himself
faithful to her, and gives her all the
pecuniary support he can command
as a mechanic, it does not occur to
him that he fails in any respect. He
has never even questioned himself on
that point. No misgivings apparently
disturb his sluggish conscience. In
this, he differs widely from his wife.
She has sharply questioned her conscience,
being perhaps dimly aware
of the weak spot in the citadel, of
the serpent coiled in the shadow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
But as she has never before given the
slightest cause for his jealousy, she
has not been even suspicious of how
terrible a sway it can have over him.
Even now she does not read the signs
aright, being blinded by her own new
infatuation.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Martin Vanderlyn
is convalescent, and making himself
more and more interesting to her.
He addresses her always with so
much respect and courtesy that it is
a continual flattery to her; for this
woman has her vanity under all her
severe simplicity of garb and mien,
and to be recognized as being superior
to her position in life is the
strongest&mdash;or <i>weakest</i>&mdash;desire of her
heart. To so regard her is to flatter
her more surely and insidiously than
to praise her beauty or her grace.</p>

<p>Sitting one day over her sewing,
she is suddenly surprised by the remark
from Vanderlyn, who has been
silently studying her: “Mrs. Thorndyke,
you are not happy.”</p>

<p>She looks up with a sort of frightened
expression, as if detected in
some crime. After a moment of deprecating,
silent supplication in her
eyes, she responds with the commonplace
question, quite at variance with
her look and manner:</p>

<p>“Why do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Because,” he says, “I am a physiognomist,
and I have been studying
your face until I can read it as I
would a book; and a more eloquent
book could not be found.”</p>

<p>The last words are spoken in a
softened voice which makes her blush
and keep her eyes steadily averted.
She has not been used to compliments
before his advent, and cannot
toss them off or return them lightly.
She feels guilty now at liking this so
well. Looking steadily at her meanwhile,
and pleased at her embarrassment,
he says, “I have read in this
book that your life is not a happy
one, and I am not surprised at reading
it. Perhaps my own past experience
has made me quicker at translating
the language of your book;
for, Mrs. Thorndyke, I have not
been happy myself, and I think your
discontent springs from a similar
source.”</p>

<p>Again that deprecating look, as if
battling with her conscience, which
whispers to her that the cause of her
trouble should not be avowed or
even tacitly admitted. Complaint
against her husband should not be
made to Martin Vanderlyn, above all.
There is already too dangerous a
sympathy between them. A subtle
intuition tells her that she is being
led into temptation, and that she
ought to end this now and for ever.
Yet she does not do so. The serpent
in the shadow has even now
warmed and stirred. Curiosity, also,
concerning Mr. Vanderlyn’s former
history leads her to encourage him
to proceed; so she says, “I am sorry
to hear that your life has not been, a
happy one. I had thought of your
leaving us to go to brighter scenes
and kinder friends.”</p>

<p>She has pondered over the absence
of any communication with friends
or relatives during his illness, and so
this last remark is not quite truthful.
She has often wondered if he has
ever had wife or lady-love. He answers
all this by his reply to her last
words:</p>

<p>“I am glad that I cannot return
to the unhappy time I speak of.
That is closed for ever. It was when
I had a wife, Mrs. Thorndyke; I have
none now.”</p>

<p>“She is dead, then,” says Agnes,
looking up, and speaking in a low
voice which she instinctively feels
should not seem sympathetic with a
grief he evidently disavows, for it is
rather a relief which he confesses.</p>

<p>“I know not,” he says, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
careless tone; “she may be, for aught
I know or care. She is dead to me,
and I know I feel quite dead to her.
We are divorced, and I am a free
man again. To that unhappy time
of my life I cannot return. The
chains are broken. It was a woeful
time. I can imagine no surer blight
on a human being’s happiness than
an unsuitable marriage. I know how
it poisons a life, because mine, for a
time, was so poisoned. I think if
there is any hell, my marriage was
arranged there by the prince himself,
who is particularly interested
in the marriage question. I think
divorces are made in heaven, not
matches, for my relief on getting my
divorce was heavenly. The sacrament
of divorce for me! The feeling
it gave me was that which old
John Bunyan ascribes to Christian
when the pack of sins fell off his
back.”</p>

<p>He speaks with an audacity which
frightens her Puritan prejudices,
while it lures her feminine admiration
for his courage in daring to
speak out and assert himself. There
is some romance here also, and a
subtle flattery in being made his confidante.
For to her more delicate
sense, this, which he would brazenly
declare to any one who might listen,
seems a sacred confidence. Her
face looks her sympathy. The answering
chord is struck, and he sees
it. The serpent has stirred to the
evil breath.</p>

<p>“Do you not think, Mrs. Thorndyke,
that we have the inborn right
to seek our own happiness? Has
not nature implanted that feeling
within us? Are not our lives a continual
protest against being made
miserable or uncomfortable for the
sake of sustaining a law of church or
state? The law of love is above
these, and it can glorify a life, or the
absence of it can debase one.”</p>

<p>“And joy was duty, and love was
law,” echoes in Mrs. Thorndyke’s
memory; and here is the “manly
form by her side.”</p>

<p>He continues without pause: “If
it is our right to pursue happiness, it
is equally our right to seek our love
freely, casting off fetters which love
disdains; they chafe his delicate
wings&mdash;love cannot live bound.”</p>

<p>“But he must be, to some extent,”
she almost gasps, frightened at this
new and dangerous doctrine. “Society,
respectability, require that
there should be a marriage bond by
which the law can hold either party
to the contract. Else what would
become of us? So many would escape
who have no right to do so.”</p>

<p>“I doubt that they have no right
to escape. The very desire for escape
constitutes the right. If the
law of love is there, no escape will
be desired.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but, Mr. Vanderlyn, in
many instances, the possibility of escape
causes a desire for it; and
where there is no way of escape, the
inevitable is accepted. ‘What can’t
be cured must be endured,’ you
know.” And there is a mournful cadence
in her voice, a drooping of
her head and eyes.</p>

<p>“That is just the cruel part of it,”
he says&mdash;“that freezing endurance
sitting like a vampire on our hearts.”</p>

<p>She puts her hand up suddenly to
her heart, and clutches at her dress
nervously, as if to hide the vampire
hidden there. Is it not rather a
tightening of the serpent’s coil?
The next moment she is composed,
and ashamed of the momentary effect
his words have caused in her
outward manner. He has seen the
motion, however, but gives no evidence
of it. As if absorbed only in
his own remembrances, not desiring
to stir up hers, he continues:</p>

<p>“I speak as one who knows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
has felt, not as one who deals with
the cold abstractions of theologians
and political economists. We who
know through bitter tasting of the
cup are the true philosophers. Our
eyes have been opened, and we see
the light. We no longer grope in the
darkness of the middle ages. We
cast off the chains forged for us ages
ago. We will be free in our love,
and in our beliefs or disbeliefs, for
creeds are chains. Do not let me
shock you, my gentle Puritan. I
beg your pardon. Do not look at
me so reprovingly, I cannot bear
it. Remember I am a sick man still,
and you are my good, sweet nurse.
You must not grieve me with your
displeasure. It is bad for me, you
know. Your frown makes me unhappy&mdash;come,
smile on me.”</p>

<p>Ah! such idle, easy, words for him
to speak&mdash;such dangerous ones for
her to hear! None such ever fall
on her ear from John Thorndyke’s
lips, and, if they should, they would
not please her so from him. She
knows this only too well, and that
this man ought not to have the
power to please her so easily. But
she allows herself this pleasure, arguing
that her life is bare enough.</p>

<p>“Do you forgive me enough to
care to hear my story?” he says,
after a pause.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” she answers; “I am interested
in that which has so colored
your feelings on this subject, and has
given you such strange views of law
and religion.” She tries to speak it
lightly, but he detects the interest in
himself. It is what he wishes.</p>

<p>“It is not much of a story,” he
says. “I was married very young&mdash;attracted
and deceived by a pretty,
saintly face, such as one sees in pictures,
and which always pleases
youth. I found my saint to be a
stubborn bigot, who put her confessor
above me, and set me and
my happiness entirely at naught in
computing her debit and credit with
her church. Such selfish looking
after one’s own interest in the next
life is to me disgusting. Every
generous impulse must be stifled for
that end. The certain present is offered
up a victim to the uncertain future.
I and my happiness had to be
forgotten in prayers, penances, fastings
and foolishness. Bah! it sickens
me to remember it. Enough
that, after bearing every discomfort, I
sought a divorce, and <i>took</i> it.”</p>

<p>He says the last in a strange tone,
which long afterwards she recalls.</p>

<p>“Had you no children?” she
asks.</p>

<p>“Yes, one; but it died, happily
for it. I should not have liked to
see a daughter of mine trained in
that church, as of course she was
doomed to be had she lived. That
alone would have goaded me to
madness&mdash;to see the fastings and
prayings duplicated. Two at it,
against one.”</p>

<p>Here the conversations ends, and
Agnes Thorndyke takes “up her
burden of life again,” with an added
protest against it. How she wishes
that she could cut the cords, and let
it fall like Christian’s pack! Poor
John Bunyan! “to what base uses
has he come at last!” Christian’s
pack of sins made to represent the
sacrament of marriage! But if “the
devil can quote Scripture for his purpose,”
he will not scruple to use John
Bunyan’s quaint fancies.</p>

<p>About this time, Mrs. Thorndyke
begins to have her attention drawn
to certain vile papers and periodicals
of the day, introduced cautiously at
first, and with some discrimination, as
if the better (or rather, <i>less bad</i>) ones
have been selected. She finds them
lying about Mr. Vanderlyn’s room,
and she reads them without comment,
but the seeds take root.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Afterwards Mr. Vanderlyn calls her
attention to certain cleverly written
but mischievous articles; flattering
her intellect by appealing to her supposed
ability to decide on these abstruse
questions. When he finds that
she reads with avidity all he procures,
faster and thicker the vile flood,
which disgraces the press and the
name of literature, pours in upon her.
Here she is almost defenceless. With
no thorough education, no religious
influence to penetrate into her life,
and guard her against this assault,
she is left to stem this torrent of
sophistry, to answer these devil’s
thoughts penned too often by the
hand of her own sex. It is a sad
but significant fact that, in this sort
of vile writing, women, when they do
stifle their better natures and take
up unclean pens, excel the other sex.
Some of the most dangerous books
of the day are written by females,
under the guise of pretended morality,
which deceives silly girls and
weak women who read them and are
unable to detect the poison under
the honey. Alas! that women should
thus prostitute their intellects in the
service of the devil!</p>

<p>When a woman of Agnes Thorndyke’s
stamp can be found reading
long editorials in a paper devoted to
the destroying of the marriage relation,
and to the advance of “free-love”
principles, alas! for the happiness,
the very legitimacy, of her children!
But what cares Martin Vanderlyn
for any such considerations?
To corrupt this woman’s nature and
to win her is his present and sole
object, and so he calls to his aid all
those of her own sex as well as of his,
who dip their pens in envenomed
ink for mercenary ends.</p>

<p>But John Thorndyke has become
jealous, and, being so, he is not a
more agreeable husband. He soon
signifies his desire that Mr. Vanderlyn
shall find for himself some other
lodgings. In doing this, he expresses
himself so coarsely, and hints so
broadly at the cause of his displeasure,
that it increases the very danger
he seeks to avoid, by forcing an
understanding and recognition of the
situation between his wife and her
patient. This is just what Mr. Vanderlyn
desires. He wishes Agnes
Thorndyke to know him to be her
lover, long before he will dare to avow
it to her. Well he knows that he must
prepare her for that, lead her step by
step up to that avowal; and he
knows that she may recoil at any
moment, and turn out from the slippery
path through which he is leading
her. Too many good instincts
and habits of early training are warring
with the bad teachings he is so
assiduously implanting, to make his
task a perfectly easy one. Now that
John Thorndyke has shown his jealousy
so plainly, these two cannot
look into each other’s eyes without
knowing there is some cause for it.
They cannot ignore it, and, while
Mr. Vanderlyn is preparing to leave,
he improves the opportunity to remark
how unhappy he is at the sad
necessity. He tells her how pleasant
it would be if he could continue
to pass all his days with her; and at
last, finding himself unreproved, he
asks if that is not possible?</p>

<p>At this she does recoil, with a wild
and frightened look like that of a
hunted deer. But he knows that it
is the first shock which either kills or
leaves the victim able to bear another.
Her mind has taken in the
full force of the proposal, and yet
she does not send him at once from
her presence. She only says, “How
can it be possible?” admitting by the
very question that she might like it
to be possible.</p>

<p>“Leave him, Agnes,” he says, “and
come to me&mdash;to me, your adorer&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
can appreciate the jewel of which he
knows not the value!”</p>

<p>“But I am his wife, and I cannot
be that to you; so, if not that, nothing,
Martin.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you can be a wife to me,
Agnes, if you must be tied by the
law. The law will soon free you as
it has freed many another. Cast off
your chains as I cast off mine, and
come to me!”</p>

<p>He holds out his arms as he
speaks, and she goes to them. The
serpent has coiled almost his last
coil!</p>

<p>In no relation except that of wife
can this woman be persuaded to live
with Vanderlyn; but the law may be
perverted, her marriage contract
basely set aside and broken. “For
better, for worse” she has taken
John Thorndyke, and she has plighted
him her troth; but she will not
have the worse, and her troth she
will not keep. Yet the law must
make her <i>seem</i> a wife, even in this
degradation. So it is agreed that
steps shall be taken to obtain a divorce,
Vanderlyn’s money being at
her service. It is so agreed, but not
without many struggles on her part.
If she is not a loving wife, she is a
tender mother. This new infatuation
cannot crush the true maternal instinct
in her heart. It requires the
wildest assurances on Vanderlyn’s
part that the law will give her the
control of her children, and that he
will care for them and educate them
as if they were his own, to keep her
from receding.</p>

<p>Vanderlyn is no longer an inmate
of her house, but he hovers around
her neighborhood, seeing her during
her husband’s absence, upon which
she can always count for a certain
number of hours every day. He
writes to her letters which seem to
her gems of poetry and eloquence,
but which are really only fulsome
flatteries, and sophistries of a godless
school which he studies and copies.
He knows that it is necessary to keep
her mind always clouded by these
false arguments, and her vanity fed
by these protestations, because she
is not by nature prone to the falsity
to which he is luring her. This
woman with a better husband, or
even with a worse husband, and
better religious teaching, could not
have been so tempted. She is no
syren, no coquette; it really needs
much careful tact, and study, and address
on Vanderlyn’s part to make
her take the first steps in this path.</p>

<p>The children seem to be her guardian
angels now. In their innocent
helplessness there is great strength.
Vanderlyn often wishes them in their
graves, for it seems to him, chafing
in his vexation, as he repeats,</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">“Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother’s breast,”</p>

<p class="pn1">that these are rivals indeed, which
may yet laugh him down and bring
her rest, unless he is unremitting in
his efforts to prevent it.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his bad desires,
scarlet-fever prostrates them all at
once, but drives him, for the time, from
the thoughts of their mother. Wan
and pale with watching, anxiety, and
dread, Agnes weeps and prays over
her little flock&mdash;prays as she has not
prayed for a long while. Yet two
are taken. The youngest darlings
are buried in one grave, leaving a
boy of seven years to fill the empty
places.</p>

<p>For a time, Vanderlyn almost
thinks his game is lost to him, and
that Death has checkmated him; for
the dead children, whose lives have
seemed in his way, are even yet his
most powerful opponents. So truly
does Agnes mourn now, so bitterly
reproach herself, that, if her husband
will meet her with any tender sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
in this their common sorrow,
some love for him may yet spring up,
watered by her tears for children
which were his as well as hers.</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">“Oh! the child, too, clothes the father with a dearness not his due.”</p>

<p class="p1">But John Thorndyke is not the
man to be tender and delicate to any
one whose grief takes such a form as
hers. Her brooding melancholy he
calls “moping.” Her silence and
shrinking from every one, he speaks
of as “airs” put on to disturb him.
He thinks the loss is his as well as
hers, and <i>he</i> is not inclined to
“mope and take on so.” He goes
to his work every day as usual, and,
although he does miss his little prattlers,
to whom he has always been
indulgent, the world does not seem
all dark to him. He is utterly incapable
of understanding how differently
this blow affects her, and it
chafes him that she does not bear it
as he does. He cannot see that the
very need of going to his daily toil,
of mixing with other men whose
minds are not on his loss, and the
leaving of his sad home every day,
helps to dissipate much morbid feeling
which might cling to him were
he obliged to stay at home, as his
wife is compelled to do. He never
thinks of the greater difference which
it has made to her in every little
change which the absence of the children
demands. The very lightening
of her care and toil for them leaves
greater time and room to grieve.
Her bereaved heart cries for love
and sympathy in this her sorest need,
and her husband does not heed the
cry; does not soften to her just at the
time he can save her.</p>

<p>Vanderlyn does not slight the
chance of increasing his influence.
He has been jealous of these children
living, he has feared their
memories may even now crowd him
from the mother’s heart, but he sees
the need of some one to <i>appear</i> at least
to share her grief. She does not scruple
to tell him how cold and unfeeling
her husband is at this time; and thus
she furnishes him with one more
weapon in the contest he is waging
against her better nature. He plays
now the part of tender, devoted
friend, rather than that of lover. He
sees that just now no lover’s image
can obtrude before the angel faces always
present to her thoughts; he has
the tact and patience to wait and turn
the present digression ultimately to
his favor. It may be that, after all,
if these children had lived, she never
could turn entirely from her duty.
But this delicate attention to her now
in her grief, contrasting so unhappily
with Thorndyke’s unfeeling, stupid
impatience with her, is the most dangerous
temptation of all, because it
wins her confidence in his being a real
friend as well as lover.</p>

<p>When the first acute feelings have
worn off after the children’s death,
and her life has gradually become
more cheerful, she turns from her
husband with a bitterness and contempt
which produce in him a still
worse frame of mind. Now he
taunts her for her assumed superiority
to him, and scoffingly pictures how
happy she might have been with
some rich man&mdash;Vanderlyn, for instance.
And so matters go on from
bad to worse, until he consents to
her applying for a divorce, seeming
as willing as she to part for ever.</p>

<p>Of what use lingering over the details?
The divorce is granted, as
such things are, in open defiance of
Heaven’s decree and the apparent
law of the land. When a New York
daily paper has frequently a list of
divorces longer than its list of marriages,
can we wonder over the fact?
In this case, it has been necessary to
change their residence for a time, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the laws of one state are more
favorable to this object than another.
But Christ’s law is the same
everywhere. Can a couple be considered
married to each other in one
part of our country, and divorced in
another? Are the children of a
second union legitimate in one state,
and illegitimate in another? It
would really seem so.</p>

<p>But Agnes Thorndyke, or rather,
Agnes Rodney, as she is now called&mdash;taking
back her maiden name, without
her maiden heart&mdash;is deprived
of one comfort on which she had
surely counted. Her one child is
left to its father. Thorndyke has
schemed for this with deliberate malice.
It is not that he loves the boy
overmuch, but it is his revenge upon
her. He would rather burden himself
with the care of this little child
than forego the pleasure it gives him
to punish her. And so, while the
father of her child lives, she lays her
head on another man’s breast, and
calls him husband. Vanderlyn is
spared either the keeping or the
breaking of his promise to care for
her children&mdash;two in the graves
where he wished them, and one in a
strange woman’s care. He has all
he wished for&mdash;John Thorndyke’s
pretty wife at last.</p>

<p>Thorndyke takes to his forsaken
home a housekeeper at first, as if he
were a widower. This woman is a
widow who makes him so comfortable
that he speedily marries her,
without considering law or Gospel as
they may bear on his case. No
compunctions trouble her easy conscience,
and she accepts the lot offered
to her as the best thing in a
business point of view likely to fall
to her. Being disinclined for reading
poetry, having no refined yearnings,
having little intellect to cultivate,
she never reads <i>Maud Muller</i>,
nor thinks of herself as out of her
place in any sense. Being good-natured
and not oversensitive, she gets
along with John Thorndyke remarkably
well, and no thought of Agnes
ever makes a ripple of disturbance
between them. She might be forgotten,
except for the boy, with her
eyes and features, left in her old
home. He calls the woman in her
place “mother,” and does get quite
motherly treatment. He loves the
brothers and sisters who in time
spring up around him, and seems as
happy in his boyish plays as if his
own mother were guarding and guiding
him. Who can say how much
his future life might be changed if
that mother had been left to him?
To be sure, her death might have
brought as great a change to him,
and we will now only follow her
fate.</p>

<p>Is she happy in her new relations?
Is joy her duty, and love her law,
now? Can that ever be, after broken
vows and outraged honor? “It is
not in the bond.” For a time she
thinks herself happier in all her more
refined associations; with leisure,
books, servants, all at her command,
and with Martin Vanderlyn devoted
to her. He does not introduce her
into society, but lives remote from
all his acquaintances and former
friends. This never troubles her.
Two people like these, who have
closed or tried to tear out a chapter
in their life-history, naturally shrink
from having it recalled. They prefer
to think themselves sufficient for
each other, looking always to the future&mdash;never
to the past, if they can
avoid it.</p>

<p>But before a year is passed, Agnes
begins to see that Vanderlyn is not
so entirely devoted to her as she
would wish and he has at first
seemed. It is the first shadow of a
misgiving, not really harbored, but
resting upon her heart in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
herself. She does not wish to see
any difference in him, and she tries
to think it is business which keeps
him so often away from her. He
says it is, and why not think so?
why not believe him? Alas! small
clouds of doubt already dot the sky
of her belief in him. Whence they
have arisen she can scarcely tell;
but there they are, and threatening
to increase. However, she has
risked too much for him, braved too
much, to foster anything now which
may wreck her life-venture. If this
man fail her, where can she turn?
But after a while a little child is
born&mdash;a boy to help divert her
thoughts from that other boy bearing
another father’s name. The mother
does blush when she thinks of these
boys, each hers, having each a different
father living <i>now</i>. She had
named her first-born after her own
father, and some idea of trying to
fill his place leads her to call this one
by the same name&mdash;George Rodney.
Vanderlyn, however, playfully calls
him Martin after himself, and, as the
child grows, he learns to answer to
that, and calls himself “Martie”
quite as often as by the name which
his mother has given him, and which
she will never relinquish.</p>

<p>So truly does the pure instinct of
motherhood show her the falsity of
her present position that she often
feels that two fathers should not be
living at the same time for the two
boys for whom she is mother. Of
that other boy she often thinks still
with yearning love, and of his sisters
in their little grave; more now than
at first, when Vanderlyn was with
her so much, for his absences grow
longer and more frequent. He takes
no father’s pride in this child of his,
but rather seems bored by the care
and trouble it has brought. A baby
<i>is</i> a tyrant in a household, especially
if it is loved as Agnes loves this one,
giving it almost all her time and care.
Now, indeed, Vanderlyn might say,
if he remembers the poet he quoted
before in his jealousy of her love for
her children:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">
“Nay, but nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry:<br />
‘Tis a purer life than thine&mdash;a lip to drain thy trouble dry:<br />
... My latest rival brings thee rest.”</p>

<p class="pn1">But it does not bring her rest. She
often now remembers that Thorndyke
was a fonder and better father
than his successor; that his children
seemed at their birth and during
their lives to form a tie between his
wife and himself; that he always
faithfully brought his hard-earned
money to her, to spend or save for
them as well as for himself. She
gives him this credit now, because
Vanderlyn, with his more abundant
means, shows in many ways a carelessness
of her comfort and pecuniary
wants. True, she has not really suffered,
but small misgivings have oppressed
her that she may yet come
to that. She has found that Vanderlyn
is not the substantial business man
she was at first led to believe. She
had thought him a lawyer, and so he
is by education; but, in reality, he is
an adventurer and a speculator, and,
although often commanding money
easily, he has no real fortune, and
has only a very fluctuating income.
This it is that worries him and takes
him often away from home long at
a time. He has not the honesty
to deny himself any accustomed
luxury for the sake of those dependent
upon him. It chafes him to
be obliged to meet his household
expenses, and not always have the
means to do so conveniently. He
knows that Agnes will not insist upon
unnecessary expenditure, but he has
not the courage to tell her frankly
of his affairs. There is a respect for
her in his heart in spite of all, and he
knows that there is an uprightness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
about her which would lead her to
insist on plainer living and fewer servants.
She is not weakly self-indulgent
as he is. He is so unprincipled
at heart that no tie, no obligation,
can bind him when it once becomes
irksome. He is a greater moral coward
than the woman he has perverted.
And so at last, when her
boy is about five years old, Agnes
finds herself deserted. Martin Vanderlyn
has gone to California, and
left her with her household effects,
and about one hundred dollars in
money&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p>She looks her fate steadily in the
face. Young enough and strong
enough yet for work, but with a helpless
child upon her hands, what
shall she do? She sells promptly
her furniture, books, pictures, and
jewelry. For the last she has never
cared, but Vanderlyn had lavished it
upon her during the days she was
seeking a divorce. Very rarely has
she worn it. With the sum thus
raised, she can, for a time, pay her
board until she can find employment,
and she seeks the most retired house
she can find for a refuge.</p>

<p>In bitterness of spirit beyond anything
she has ever endured while the
honest wife of John Thorndyke,
Agnes now feels in almost overwhelming
force the folly of the
course she has pursued&mdash;<i>almost</i> overwhelming,
but not quite, for she still
believes herself to be Martin Vanderlyn’s
lawful wife. Bad as he has proved
himself, she as yet has no doubt
that he is her lawful husband, and
so, in her present abode, she calls herself
Mrs. Vanderlyn, with no thought
but that she is so honestly, if not
wisely.</p>

<p>She has been in her new home rather
less than a week, when, passing
along the corridor, she meets,
coming from a room near her own,
two Sisters of Mercy, who have apparently
just taken leave of an invalid
lady; at least, so she judges
from the voice which comes through
the open door, saying:</p>

<p>“Good-by, and come again soon,
Sisters,” followed by a cough that
to her experienced ear sounds like
consumption. She has heard that
cough in the night when she has
been wakeful, and she hears it again
many times this day. She thinks of
the invalid often, with her old instinct
of sympathy for the sick&mdash;a
sympathy which of late years has not
been much called forth in her retirement.
The next day, coming in
from her quest for employment, she
meets on the porch a gentleman who,
she feels almost sure, is a Catholic
priest. He enters the house at the
same time with herself, and, proceeding
before her up the stairs, passes
directly and quietly to the room occupied
by her sick neighbor. “She
is a Catholic, then,” says Agnes to
herself; “but that does not matter.
I wonder if I could do her any
good?” And she acknowledges to
herself a very strong desire to see
her neighbor, and offer any service in
her power. But she does not act at
once. Her peculiar position makes her
shrink from meeting strangers or forming
acquaintances. Still, the cough
strikes upon her ear appealingly, all
the more that there comes no sound
of any voices from the room, save
when the priest or the Sisters of
Mercy are there. She knows her
neighbor must be alone, and, she
suspects, lonely also, for many hours.
She resolves to go to see her, and
take little George, thinking, in the
fondness of her mother’s heart, that
his pretty ways may divert the sick
woman.</p>

<p>But who is she, and what is her
name? Agnes asks this of her landlady
the first time she finds that everbusy
and worried woman alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“The sick lady in the front room?
Why, she is your namesake, perhaps
a relation.” And the landlady eyes
keenly her questioner, thinking her
curiosity about both of her boarders
will now be gratified, as she slowly
adds: “She is a Mrs. Vanderlyn, as
well as yourself.”</p>

<p>Agnes feels herself trembling and
almost choking at the swift rush of
conviction coming over her as to
who this Mrs. Vanderlyn is: The
priest and the Sisters of Mercy!
Martin Vanderlyn’s wife was a Catholic!
She can hardly command her
voice to ask:</p>

<p>“Is she a widow?”</p>

<p>“I guess so, but she hasn’t said
so,” replied the landlady. “She has
no friends, except them horrid spooks
of nuns and that there sneakin’
priest; I do declare I’m ashamed to
see ‘em a-comin’ in and out o’ my
door&mdash;but <i>you</i> be’ent a Catholic, be
you?” she says, in sudden alarm, lest
her burst of confidence has been misplaced.
Agnes reassures her by
saying:</p>

<p>“Oh! no; I am not a Catholic,
nor is any of my family; so I think
this lady can be no relative, as my
husband was never a Catholic.”</p>

<p>What makes her voice change as
she shapes her reply in this evasive
way? It is not altogether the keen,
inquiring eyes of the landlady trying
to find if she is wife or widow. She
can scarcely tell herself; but the
sharpened sense of expectation of
some coming revelation, or else the
nearness of Martin Vanderlyn’s wife,
makes her feel for the first time a
sense of guilt in speaking of him as
her husband. Not that she says
even to herself as yet that he is <i>not</i>
her husband; but the two wives&mdash;if
this is his wife&mdash;in such close proximity,
impresses her much as the fact
of the two living fathers of her two
boys has done. It cannot seem to
her quite right for herself to be Martin
Vanderlyn’s wife, while the woman
in the next room is such a
reality. As long as the divorced
wife had seemed to belong to the
past&mdash;perhaps dead&mdash;it had not impressed
Agnes so keenly as to be living
under the same roof with her; for
Agnes feels almost sure that it is so.
Still, her desire to see her neighbor
is by no means lessened; and it is not
idle curiosity, but a nobler feeling,
which leads her to ask the landlady
to introduce her. That person has,
in the meantime, remarked:</p>

<p>“The lady is a real lady, and, if
she <i>is</i> a Catholic, I can’t say aught
agin her. I do hate to see them
beads, and crosses, and figgers, and
picturs of folks with Saturn’s rings
on their heads, which she keeps in
her room; but, if she gits any comfort
from ‘em, poor soul, why, I can’t begrudge
her that. Only I wish she
had more light and some <i>real</i> religion,
now that she’s so near dyin’. I
do hate to see her sunk in darkness,
without no light o’ the Gospel. But
‘tain’t no use talkin’ to her, she never
gits offended; but, when I wanted to
send a good Methodist minister to
pray with her, she said her spiritooal
needs was already cared for by. Father
what’s-his-name, and she jist
give me back that lovely tract about
<i>Going to Hell</i>, as if she warn’t scared
a bit. ‘Tain’t no use, Mrs. Vanderlyn,
to talk to her. They’re all of
‘em so set and superstitious they
<i>can’t</i> experience religion or have any
realizin’ sense o’ their sins.”</p>

<p>Says Agnes: “I don’t want to
minister to her soul. That is not my
mission. I only thought she was
lonely, and I might do her some
good in being a little company for
her some of the time, if nothing
more.”</p>

<p>“And so you might, and it’s right
good of you to think of it. It’ll take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
some off my mind to know you’ll
see her sometimes, as I can’t find
time to go in and sit with her as
often as I think she may expect of
me.”</p>

<p>And the landlady, followed by
Agnes, taps at the door of Mrs. Vanderlyn’s
room. In a minute more,
Agnes finds herself face to face with
the invalid, who is sitting in a large
easy-chair by the window. After
some words from the landlady, explaining
Agnes’ kind intention and
sympathy, that garrulous person
withdraws to her pressing household
cares.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c272" name="c272">JOHN BAPTIST DE ROSSI AND HIS ARCHÆOLOGICAL WORKS.</a></h2>

<p class="pc1 reduct">FROM THE HISTORISCH-POLITISCHE BLAETTER.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> ruins that lie by the banks of
the Tigris and the Euphrates give us
a better notion of the power of the
kings of Babylon and Assyria, of
the civilization, religion, and moral
condition of the ancient peoples of
these countries, than the writings of
historians. The obelisks and pyramids,
the ruined temples and the
columns covered with hieroglyphic
characters, tell us more of Egypt
than Herodotus and Manetho. In
like manner do the tombs and inscriptions
in the catacombs bear witness
to the faith and morality, the
usages and manner of living, of the
early Christians.</p>

<p>The study of these catacombs has
therefore a double aim: one dogmatic,
the other historical. Considered
from the latter standpoint alone,
the discoveries recently made in the
catacombs destroy the theories and
appreciations of many historians. It
is literally true, as a distinguished
non-Catholic has said, that, “since
Rossi published his works, the history
of the age of the Christian martyrs
has to be rewritten.” The distinguished
Alfred de Reumont, on page
806 of the first volume of his <i>History
of the City of Rome</i>, says: “No one
knows better than the author how
much this work is indebted to the
researches of De Rossi.”</p>

<p>The pontificate of Pius IX., among
its other glories, can claim that of
having especially aided De Rossi in
his archæological studies; and on this
account alone it would deserve the
gratitude of all the friends of science.
Pius IX. has deserved the name
of the “second Damasus,” not only
because he founded “The Archæological
Commission for the Investigation
of the Ancient Christian Monuments
of Rome,” and aided it with
pecuniary subsidies, but more particularly
because he took a lively personal
interest in all its undertakings.</p>

<p>The zeal of Pius IX. found in John
Baptist de Rossi, a born Roman, a
most suitable person for the advancement
of archæological lore. And,
in fact, Rossi alone, as all acknowledge,
made more progress than all
his predecessors. Although he has
been more than a quarter of a century
at work, he is still a hale man;
and if Piedmontese brutality or revolutionary
barbarism does not prevent
him, he may yet make more splendid
progress in his learned studies.
Rossi has wonderful powers of observation,
united with great calmness and
perseverance in investigation, ardent
love of science, and vast erudition.
He is well versed in all the branches
of his favorite science&mdash;in archæology,
bibliography, history, æsthetics, topography,
and architecture. With keen
discernment, which his complicated
investigations never lead astray, he
knows how to choose and value his
materials. We know not which to
admire more&mdash;the persevering industry,
or the great and unflinching mental
and physical strength, which he
displays in assorting the various materials
which come before him. His
judgment in forming hypotheses, in
drawing conclusions and consequences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
is always prudent. He prefers to
prove too little rather than too much.
On this account, as well as because of
his critical acumen, he has obtained
such a reputation among archæologists
that Martigny, in his <i>Dictionary
of Christian Antiquities</i>, says: “We
can rely implicitly on every word
that Rossi writes.” Rossi never builds
a card-house; he makes no vague,
superficial reasonings. All is deeply
thought; monuments and documents
are always brought in to corroborate
his assertions; and we know that nothing
is more solid and convincing
than the hard marble.</p>

<p>It is true Rossi has not published
the half of his immense collections;
but from what has been published
we can perceive that nothing so important
has appeared in the archæological
world since the time of Bosio,
perhaps never anything so vast from
one archæologist.</p>

<p>The first great archæological work
of Rossi appeared when he was yet
a young man. It was printed in the
third volume of the <i>Spicilegium Solesmense</i>,
published by the celebrated
Benedictine Dom Pitra, now cardinal
of the church. Rossi always
quotes it with pleasure as his first
work. The title is <i>A Letter on the
Christian Monuments bearing the Inscription
ΙΧΘΥΣ</i>. Paris, 1855.</p>

<p>The figurative and poetical style
of the Sacred Scriptures, as well as the
discipline of the secret, introduced
into the “Church of the Catacombs”
those numerous symbols, so full of
meaning, which, disguised in the simplest
pictures or the simplest words,
expressed so much to the initiated.
The lamb, the anchor, ship, the
stag, peacock, the cock, the dove,
etc., were symbols of sublime Christian
ideas. But the most important
of all the Christian symbols was the
<i>fish</i>. It is mentioned as a Christian
hieroglyphic all through the works
of the Fathers, and appears on all the
old monuments. On these latter,
sometimes the Greek word <i>ΙΧΘΥΣ</i>
sometimes the painted, and some
times the engraved, image of the fish,
is found. During the period of the
discipline of the secret, especially during
the first three centuries of the
church, the most holy mysteries of
Christianity were concealed from the
uninitiated under the symbol of the
fish.</p>

<p>The fish is the symbol of Jesus
Christ. The Fathers before the IVth
century insinuate this in obscure and
ambiguous terms, while those of the
IVth and Vth centuries proclaim it
plainly. Thus writes towards the
end of the IVth century Bishop Optatus
Milevitanus:<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> “The fish, according
to its Greek orthography,
<i>Ιχθυς</i> expresses by its letters a number
of holy names, which in Latin are
<i>Jesus Christus Dei Filius Salvator</i>”&mdash;Jesus
Christ, Son of God, Saviour&mdash;<i>Ιησοῦς
Χριστός Θεοῦ Υἱὸς
Σοτήρ</i>. S. Augustine<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> expressly
says that, if you take the first letters,
of these five Greek words, and unite
them together, you have <i>ἰχθυς</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
<i>fish</i>, which name is a symbol of
Christ.</p>

<p>Some ecclesiastical writers strive
to connect the fish-symbol of Christ
with the Sibylline prophecies; other
Fathers endeavor to find in it certain
analogies between the nature and acts
of the fish and the human nature and
works of Christ. The different passages
of ancient writers on these
points are brought together in De
Rossi’s treatise. Rossi himself has
beautifully explained the origin of
this symbol.</p>

<p>The fish is the symbol of Christ
according to his human nature. In
the figurative language of the church,
the present life is likened to a sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
<i>Ubique mare sæculum legimus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> says
Optatus Milevitanus. Ambrose calls
men the fish who swim through this
life. When the divine Word became
man, he became a fish as we. Hence
Gregory the Great wrote: “Christ
condescended to hide himself in the
waters of human nature, in order to
be captured by the angel of death.”</p>

<p>More frequently the fish is used
as the symbol of the divine nature of
Christ. The large fish caught by
Tobias that he might have food for
his journey, use the liver and gall to
free Sara from devils, and restore
sight to his father, was considered by
the Fathers as a striking symbol of
the divine Redeemer, who by the
light of his doctrine cures the blindness
of ignorance, redeems the world
from the power of demons, and feeds
us with his body on the pilgrim route
from earth to heaven. Therefore is
Christ symbolized as Teacher of truth
in his church; as Redeemer from the
power of Satan by baptism; and as
Food of souls in the Eucharist.</p>

<p>Out of the many beautiful and expressive
symbolical representations
of the intimate connection between
Christ and his church, we shall select
only the two figures numbered
104 and 105 in De Rossi’s tract. In
the midst of a surging sea a fish is
swimming, carrying on its back a ship,
the symbol of the church. It is the
divine <i>Ιχθυσ</i>, who, according to his
promise made to his church, carries
her safely through the storms of the
world. The ship is managed by
rowers, the hierarchy of the church.
The only pilot and leader of the
ship is the Holy Ghost, represented
by a dove sitting on the top of the
mast. In order that no one may
mistake the vessel, the scene of
Christ giving the keys to Peter is
painted in the foreground exactly as
our modern painters represent it.
In order to make this point clear,
namely, that the Holy Ghost is guiding
the bark of Peter, the words <i>ΙΗΣ</i>
(<i>Ιησοῦς</i>) and <i>ΠΕΤ</i> (<i>Πέτρος</i>) are
written over the picture.</p>

<p>Man is born the child of divine
wrath: Christ frees him from Satan’s
power by baptism; makes him a
child of God, a new man, a <i>neophyte</i>.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
Now, as Christ the Fish scatters these
his blessings in the baptismal font,
it was called by the names of <i>baptisterium</i>,
<i>illuminatorium</i>, and, more frequently
during the time of the discipline
of the secret, <i>piscina</i>, or fishpond.
Therefore Bishop Oriontius
of Auch wrote in the Vth century:
“The fish, born in the water, is the author
of baptism.” Therefore were
the oldest baptisteries commonly ornamented
with the picture of a fish
(Rossi, p. 3).</p>

<p>In many of the monuments collected
by Rossi, near the word <i>ΙΧΘΥΣ</i>
we have also the word <i>ΝΙΚΑ</i>. The
fish conquers. The neophyte is freed
from ruin and the power of Satan&mdash;he
is a trophy of Christ’s victory.</p>

<p>Since the word fish, as well as the
picture of it, was perfectly identified
with Christ the Redeemer, it was
natural to use this symbol to conceal
that mystery which the pagans so
fearfully misrepresented when they
said that the Christians met together
at stated times, slaughtered a child,
drank its blood, and ate its flesh.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The fish became the symbol of the
Holy Eucharist. This could be done
with the greater propriety, since
Rossi tells us that, at the banquets of
the wealthy pagans, fish was considered
a delicacy, and it is seldom found
on pagan monuments. Hence, to
eat <i>the fish</i>, and to receive Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Communion, became synonymous
expressions. Prosper of Aquitaine calls
Christ the great Fish, who gives himself
as food to his disciples and the
faithful.</p>

<p>We cannot enter into details, and
shall only consider the monumental
inscription found at Autun
in 1839, which has attracted so much
attention from the archæologists.
The text begins with the words:
<i>Ιχθυσ οὐρανίου θεῖον γένος
ἤτορι σεμνῷ χρῆσαι</i>: “O divine
race of the heavenly Ikthus, guard,
after you have received it, the immortal
fountain of grace flowing from
divine sources. Bathe thy soul, my
friend, in the ever-flowing waters of
wealth-giving wisdom. Receive the
sweet food of the Saviour of the saints;
eat and drink the Ikthus which thou
holdest in thy hands.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> O Ikthus, I
have prepared my hands, I long for
thee, my Lord and my Redeemer!
That I may behold thee in happiness,
O my mother; I beseech this favor
of thee, O light of the dead. Aschaudius,
my father, thou dearest to
my heart, with my sweet mother and
my sisters, in the peace of the Ikthus
remember thy son Pektorius.”</p>

<p>The first verse of this beautiful inscription
which many of the learned
in the time of Marcus Aurelius and
at the end of the IIId century use, alludes
to the grace of baptism; the
following sentences refer to the sacramental
use of the Ikthus. In the
concluding phrase, the founder of
the monument, Pectorius, addresses
himself to his parents and relatives,
with the petition that they would remember
him in heaven, where they
enjoyed the peace of the Ikthus.</p>

<p>From this important monument,
as well as from many others collected
by Rossi, it is proven that the Holy
Eucharist was thought to be a <i>sacrament</i>
by the early Christians. In
others, it is equally clear that they
considered it a <i>sacrifice</i> also.</p>

<p>In one of the oldest cemeteries,
that of Domitilla, as well as in that of
Callistus, we see a thrice sweet sacrificial
table, on which three loaves and
one fish are lying. On each side of
the table are seven baskets with loaves.
The meaning of the picture is plain.
The connection of the Ikthus with the
bread is clearly shown. “The table
represents the Christian altar. This
was usually a portable slab of marble
with brazen rings, placed over a martyr’s
grave, and supported by little
columns. But what else could the
Christian artist wish to symbolize by
placing the fish beside the bread than
the offering of the divine Ikthus on
the altar? We have, therefore, on
the one hand, the invisible presence
of the divinity in the fish; on the
other, the visible form of the bread,
and then the position of the mysterious
representation. The sacrifice is
the table of the Lord, the Eucharistic
banquet. To make this clearer, the
seven baskets filled with loaves surround
the sacrificial table. They
represent the seven baskets which
were filled with the remnants left
after the multiplication of the loaves
in the wilderness&mdash;a miracle which
has always been considered a type of
Holy Communion.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Dom Pitra, in his <i>Spicilegium</i>, has
added to Rossi’s documents many
found in Gaul. Ferdinand Becker,
in the <i>Historisch-Politische Blätter</i>,
vol. lxiii., p. 736 <i>et seq.</i>, has written,
since Rossi’s time, a remarkable article
on the “Symbol of Jesus Christ
under the Figure of a Fish.” Professor
Jacob Becker has published something
on the same subject. Rossi
naturally did not treat of the German
discoveries in this line of archæology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>It is singular that the symbol of
the fish continued to be used in Germany
up to the middle age. In the
<i>Hortus Deliciarum</i> of the Abbess
Herrad, written in the XIIth century,
and still preserved in the Strasbourg
Library, there is a representation of
the sacrament of the altar, by means
of a small basket with a loaf and a
fish. In a picture in the cathedral
library at Einsiedeln, there is the symbol
of a fish whose blood is represented
as opening the gates of limbo.</p>

<p>Northern Africa, once so celebrated
in the annals of the church, did not
escape the research of Rossi. Léon
Rénier has collected, in a work entitled
<i>Roman Inscriptions of Algeria</i>,
published at Paris, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1838, most of
those documents which caused Rossi
to undertake his second great work,
<i>A Letter to J. B. Pitra, Benedictine
Monk, on the Christian Titles found at
Carthage</i>. These documents are very
important as explaining the symbol
of the cross. The Christians, for various
reasons, were unwilling at first to
represent the cross among their symbols.
The cross was the <i>damnata
crux</i> of Apuleius, the <i>infelix lignum</i>
of Seneca, the <i>teterrimum, crudelissimumque
supplicium</i> of Cicero. The
Christians, therefore, did not wish to
give the pagans an occasion of insult,
nor to give scandal to the weak faith
of the catechumens. Prudent respect,
as well as wise foresight, induced
them to conceal their most holy symbol
in the interest of the progress of
faith. Consequently, as Rossi proves,
we find the <i>cruces dissimulatæ</i> among
the symbols, which, by their similarity
with the real figure of the cross, became
Christian symbols, but, on account
of their being also recognized
as heathen symbols, excited no scandal
or suspicion. Such concealed
symbols, or <i>cruces dissimulatæ</i>, are,
according to Rossi, the <i>Tau</i> or
crooked cross, the oblique or S. Andrew’s
cross, the anchor cross, and
the monogram of Christ with all its
varieties.</p>

<p>The oldest monogram is the simple
<i>Χ</i>, the first letter of Christ’s holy
name. At a later period, the <i>Χ</i> was
united with the <i>Ι</i>, the two together
standing for <i>Ιησοῦς Χριστός</i>. Before
the time of Constantine, the monogram
was represented by the union
of the Greek letters <i>Χ</i> and <i>Ρ</i>, the two
first letters of the word <i>ΧΡΙϹΤΟϹ</i>.
After the conversion of Constantine,
when the punishment of the cross
was abolished, and all that was offensive
or scandalous in it removed, the
symbol became more striking by the
introduction of a cross-line. In the
second half of the IVth century, in
spite of the Julian persecution, the
symbol of the cross became more
plain. But when Christianity, in and
since the time of Theodosius the
Great, took possession of the laws,
and ordinances, and customs of the
empire, the symbol became so clear
that all could understand it. Therefore,
after the end of the IVth century,
and in the beginning of the Vth,
we find the simple figure of the cross
on all public monuments, without
any attempt to conceal it.</p>

<p>The progress of this symbol of the
cross was not so slow in development
in some of the remote provinces
as in the city of Rome and its
environs. In some of the distant
provinces, the power of paganism
ceased to control the people at an
earlier date than in the city, and,
consequently, allowed the Christians
to manifest their symbols without
fear. This happened as early as the
IId century in Northern Africa,
where the Christians were powerful
at a very early date. Rossi, in the
same work, gives us valuable documents
and proofs to show the important
place which the symbol of
the triangle should hold in archæological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
disquisitions. It was a recognized
symbol of the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>It is a common custom among
certain prejudiced modern writers to
speak of the “hatred of the early
Christians for art.” By degrees,
however, the bandage begins to fall
from their eyes, and the truth becomes
clearer. To Rossi much credit
is due for having labored to destroy
this prejudice also. The attention
of the early Christians was
called to works of sculpture rather
than to works of painting. And this
was quite natural. The statues were
mostly naked. And “among the
entirely naked Aphrodites of the later
Greek and Roman artists, there is
hardly one in which the woman does
not predominate over the goddess.
Sensuality and grossness are conspicuous
in most of them.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Some of
them also knew that the Venus of
Praxiteles, which he represented at
first entirely unclothed, was copied
after a model of Phryne.</p>

<p>It is different with painting&mdash;after
music and poetry, the most spiritual
of arts. “By the blending of light
and shade, and the laws of perspective,
it can give a tone of spirituality
to the bodily form, and an ethical
appearance to the inanimate. Painting
is the art of soul impressions.
Everything great, noble, and refined
can be better expressed on the canvas
than in marble.” The Christian
muse, therefore, naturally took to
painting. Hence on the walls in
the catacombs we find the first efforts
of the Christian painters. Likenesses
of the Mother of God are among
the first which we meet. These pictures,
in which virginal innocence,
maternal tenderness, holy worth,
tender grace and piety, are manifested,
have been collected and published
in 1863 in large chromo-lithographs
in his work entitled <i>Imagine
Scelte della B. Vergine tratte dalle
Catacombe Romane</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest likeness of the Mother
of God is found in the catacombs of
Priscilla. On account of the many
likenesses of the Blessed Virgin found
in them, these have been called the
Marian Catacombs. There is no
doubt that these pictures are of apostolic
date, and originated with that
Priscilla who was known both to Peter
and Paul, the mother of the Senator
Pudens, and grandmother of the
holy virgins Praxedes and Pudentiana.
In the arch of the central crypt,
the adoration of the magi is painted.
The Blessed Virgin holds the Infant
Jesus in her bosom; before her in the
sky is the star whose light leads the
three wise men from the East to visit
the divine Child.</p>

<p>In another crypt is delineated the
annunciation of the angel. The
Blessed Virgin sits on a throne like
the ancient episcopal chairs; before
her stands the archangel as a beautiful,
ethereal youth, without wings, dressed
in tunic and pallium, his right hand
raised, and the index finger of it
pointed at the Virgin. In her face
there is a look of surprise and holy,
virginal shyness. On the ceiling of
another grave-niche, in the very oldest
part of the catacomb, close to the
graves of the family of Pudens, we
find a painted picture of the Virgin
and Child in the pure classic style.
Rossi, supported by the most various
archæological and historical documents,
places this picture in the time
between the second half of the Ist
and the first half of the IId century.
The Blessed Virgin, clothed with
many-folded drapery and cloak, bears
on her head the veil usually worn by
the married or betrothed. Over her
hangs the star of Bethlehem; before
her stands a young, powerful-looking
man, with a prophet’s mantle thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
over his shoulders. In his left hand
he holds a scroll, and with the right
he points to the star and the Virgin
and Child. He is Isaias the Prophet,
pointing out the favored Virgin, the
branch of the root of Jesse, who
was to conceive and bring forth the
blessed Fruit; and showing the great
light which was to shine over Jerusalem.
The beauty of the composition;
the grace and dignity of the
figures; the swelling folds of the
drapery; and the correctness and spiritual
beauty of the expression, make
this, although the oldest picture of
the Madonna, one of the most striking
which we possess. The elder
Lenormant did not hesitate to compare
it with Raphael’s best productions.</p>

<p>The picture of the Madonna in the
second table of Rossi is of more recent
origin. In this picture, the
Mother of God sits on a chair of
honor, holding the divine Child in her
lap. The three kings, led by a star,
come to meet her. It is from the
cemetery of Domitilla. We omit the
other pictures of the adoration of the
magi in the other catacombs of Callistus,
Cyriaca, etc.</p>

<p>The assertion of the Calvinist historian
Basnage, that the pictures of
the Blessed Virgin were not introduced
into the church until after the
Council of Ephesus, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 431, sinks
to the ground in the face of Rossi’s
documents.</p>

<p>He has collected in his works the
chief inscriptions to be met with in
the catacombs, and has surpassed
all his predecessors in the completeness
of his information and documents.
Although, after the discovery
and investigation of the catacombs
by the celebrated Bosio, many authors
like Aringhi, Bottari, Boldetti,
the Jesuit Lupi, Marchi, and others,
had treated on them, and the relations
of their contents to theological
sciences and ecclesiastical studies,
none has equalled the distinguished
Rossi, whose ardor, energy, and talent
were always aided by the most
liberal sympathy of the Roman
Pontiff.</p>

the king, who knew that no other
prince could boast of such a servant.</p>

<p>Offero, supposing his master to be
afraid of no one, was greatly surprised
on perceiving the king tremble
and cross himself, whenever
the name of Satan was mentioned.
“Why dost thou do so?” he inquired
of the monarch.</p>

<p>“Because Satan is very mighty,”
replied his master, “and I am afraid
lest he should overcome me.”</p>

<p>“Then I must leave thee, for I will
serve only him who is afraid of no
one,” said Offero.</p>

<p>Again he commenced his wanderings;
this time in search of Satan.
One day, on crossing a desert, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
perceived a horrible object with the
appearance of great power coming
towards him. Offero’s great size
seemed not in the least to startle
him, and with an air of authority
he asked: “Whom dost thou
seek?”</p>

<p>“Satan,” Offero answered, “for
I have heard that he is the most
powerful upon earth. I wish to have
him for my master.”</p>

<p>“I am <i>he</i>,” said the other, “and
thy service shall be an easy one.”</p>

<p>The giant bowed low, and joined
his followers.</p>

<p>As they pursued their way they
came in sight of a cross. No sooner
had Satan’s eyes perceived it, than
he turned with evident fear and haste
and took another road, so as to avoid
passing the cross.</p>

<p>Offero was not slow in noticing
these signs of alarm. “Why dost
thou do so?” he asked his master.</p>

<p>“I fear the cross,” Satan made answer,
“because Christ died upon it,
and I fly from it lest it should overcome
me.”</p>

<p>“Then there is one more powerful
than thou, and I shall leave thee
and seek him,” replied Offero. With
these words, he left Satan and went
in search of Christ.</p>

<p>After much toil and long wanderings,
he came to a hermit, whom he
entreated to tell him where Christ
could be found.</p>

<p>The holy man, seeing him thus
ignorant, pitied and taught him.
“Christ is indeed the greatest king in
heaven and on earth,” he said, “for
his power will endure throughout
eternity; but thou canst not serve
him lightly&mdash;he will impose great duties
upon thee, and he will require
that thou fast often.”</p>

<p>“I will not fast,” said Offero, “for
that would weaken my strength,
which makes me so good a servant.”</p>

<p>“Thou also must pray,” continued
the hermit, taking no heed of the interruption.</p>

<p>“I have never prayed and will
never do so. Such service is for
weaklings, not for me,” replied the
giant.</p>

<p>“Then,” said the hermit, “dost
thou know of a river whose waters
are wild and deep, and often swollen
by rains, sweeping away in its swift
current many of those who would
cross it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Offero.</p>

<p>“Then go there and aid those
who fight with its waves; carry the
weak and little ones across upon
thy strong, broad shoulders. This
is good work, and, if Christ will have
thee in his service, he will assure thee
of his acceptance.”</p>

<p>Offero went to the river, and on
its banks built himself a hut. Day
and night he aided all who came,
carrying many upon his shoulders,
and never wearying in assisting them
across the river. A palm-tree was
his staff, which he had pulled in the
forest, and which was well suited to
his great strength and height.</p>

<p>One night, when resting in his hut,
he heard a voice like that of a weak
child, and it said: “Offero, wilt thou
carry me?”</p>

<p>He rose quickly and went out,
but, search as he would, he could
find no one; and he re-entered his
dwelling; but presently the voice
called again: “Offero, wilt thou carry
me?” A second search proved fruitless.
At the third call he rose again,
taking with him a lantern. He
searched, and at last found a child.
“Offero, Offero, carry me over this
night?”</p>

<p>He lifted him up and began crossing
the stream. Immediately the
wind commenced to blow, the waves
rose high, and the roar of the waters
sounded like thunder. The child
also began to increase in weight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
grew more heavy upon his shoulders,
and Offero feared that he
must sink; but, with the aid of his
staff, he kept himself up, and at last
succeeded in reaching the opposite
shore. Then he cried: “Whom have
I carried? Had it been the whole
world, it could not have been heavier.”</p>

<p>Then the child replied: “<i>Me</i>,
whom thou desirest to serve, and I
have accepted thee. Thou hast not
only carried the world, but <i>him</i> who
made it, upon thy shoulders. As a
sign of my power and my approbation
of thee, fix thy staff in the earth,
and it shall grow and bear fruit.”</p>

<p>Offero did so, and soon it was covered
with leaves and fruit. But the
wonderful child was gone. Then Offero
knew that it was Christ whom he
had carried, and he fell down and
worshipped him.</p>

<p>Thenceforth he called himself Christopher,
served his Master faithfully,
holding fast to his new faith
through all kinds of tortures and sufferings.</p>

<p>King Dagnus of Lycia, after having
thrown him into prison, and not succeeding
in turning him from his faith,
commanded that he should be executed.</p>

<p>Arrived at the place of execution,
he knelt down and prayed that all
who saw him and believed in Christ,
should be delivered from earthquake
fire, and tempest. It was believed
that his prayers were heard, and that
all who look upon the figure of S.
Christopher are safe, for that day,
from all dangers of earthquake, flood,
and fire. The sight of it is believed
also to impart strength to the weak
and weary.</p>

<p class="p1">“Our Clerical Friends” appear to be
suffering pain from the strong sinapisms
of Dr. Marshall. At least, we suspect
they must be in pain, from certain suppressed,
inarticulate cries and moans
of the <i>Church Journal</i>, <i>Churchman</i>, etc.
Their doctor is inexorable, however, and
has already applied another blister.
Their internal disorder is too deeply seated
and obstinate to allow of any milder
treatment. They have been seized with
such a violent madness of fancying themselves
priests and playing at Catholic
that argument is lost on them, unless
plentifully infused with ridicule. <i>Church
Defence</i> is unmerciful in its ridicule, like
the <i>Comedy of Convocation</i>, but it is also
perfectly genteel and polished in its style,
and as overwhelming in argument as an
essay by Dr. Newman. Those who have
laughed over the sparkling pages of the
classic <i>Comedy</i>, will enjoy another laugh
over this new drama, and those who have
been thrown into a rage by <i>My Clerical
Friends</i> will be at a loss for epithets wherewith
to give vent to their pent-up bosoms
when they read this new amiable discussion,
which they will and must do, in
spite of themselves. Dear friends and
would-be Catholics, you might as well
laugh with the whole world that is laughing
at you! Your little farce is played
out. It is a small business to be trying
to cheat poor girls who are entrapped by
your counterfeit Sisters, by pretending
that you are Catholic priests and can
give them sacraments. Something else is
wanted besides acolytes and nicolytes,
candles and high celebrations, mimicry
of our sacerdotal dress, and high collars
or high altars. You are outdone even in
counterfeiting Catholicity by the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Greek schismatical chapel, where there is
a better Signor Blitz than any of your

Conrad von Bolanden. New York:

1873.</p>

<p class="p1">The second of these novelettes by the
most popular writer of fiction among the
Catholics of Germany is really a charming
story. The character of “Angela” is
remarkably well drawn, and is the type
of a perfect Christian woman, in the three
phases which are so full of moral and
poetic beauty, as maiden, bride, and mistress
of the household. The first one
is very different, dealing with incidents
and scenes which are not so pleasing,
but unfortunately equally real. As both
are reprints from the pages of this magazine,
our readers will remember them, and
no doubt be glad to get them in a separate
form. Those who have not read them
will find them not only entertaining reading,
but full of thought and instruction on
most important and practical topics of
modern life.</p>

by Lady Herbert. New York:
The Catholic Publication Society.
1873.</p>

<p class="p1">These two works are translations from
the French by Lady Herbert, for the
benefit of S. Joseph’s Foreign Missionary
College at Mill Hill near London, to
which she has been a warm friend and
liberal patron from the beginning.
Americans cannot help feeling a great
interest in that institution, for the first
band of missionaries it sent forth came
to labor among the colored people of our
Southern States.</p>

<p>Nothing could be better calculated to
stimulate the fervor of the aspirant to the
missionary life than the example of these
two young Christian heroes worthy of
the primitive ages of the church&mdash;worthy,
it might be said, of the XIXth century;
for never was there an age that required
more firmness of purpose and constancy
to the truth than this, with its glorious
confessors of the faith in Asia, and as
large an army of martyrs on the other
side of the globe undergoing the slower
torture of heart and soul that is far worse
than that of the cangue.</p>

<p>The lives of the two missionaries before
us are affecting to the last degree.
Every Catholic youth should read them,
if not to fully emulate their example, to
which all have not the happiness of being
called, at least to catch something of the
unworldliness and burning piety they
manifested from their very childhood.
Indeed, we wish everybody could read
them, for there could be no better proof
of the holy influences of the Catholic religion
upon the young heart. We linger
with admiration over the account of their
boyhood overshadowed by their future
martyrdom. One golden thread runs
through their whole lives&mdash;one constant
aim&mdash;the wish to win souls to Christ, and
at last to gain the martyr’s crown. And
this intense desire for martyrdom was no
mere youthful enthusiasm, as was proved
when their lifelong prayer was granted.
But amid all the self-denial with which
they fitted themselves for their glorious
destiny, nothing in their character is
more striking than the tender affection&mdash;passing
ordinary human love&mdash;apparent
in their intercourse with their families,
as if religion had refined every fibre of
their hearts, and made them more keenly
susceptible of love, of suffering, and of
devotion to the service of God. They
never allowed earthly affections, however,
to come between them and their
great aim in life. What angels of the
sanctuary they were while preparing for
the sublime functions of the priesthood!
What a lofty conception they had of the
sacrament of holy orders that consecrated
them to a life of sacrifice! How joyfully
they entered upon the life that
promised them the radiant crown.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Prepared for virgin souls and them<br />
Who seek the martyr’s diadem.”</p>

<p class="p1">“<i>Souffrir pour Dieu</i>&mdash;To suffer for God&mdash;will
henceforth be my motto,” said
Henri Dorié, about to leave his country
for ever. Everything at the <i>Séminaire des
Missions Etrangères</i> was calculated to
strengthen this desire for suffering. Old
missionaries, who bore in their bodies
the marks of the Lord Jesus, were their
professors. Every day they went to pray
in the Hall of Martyrs, around which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
ranged the relics of those who have suffered
for the faith in China, Japan, and
the isles of the sea, together with the instruments
of their martyrdom&mdash;an appalling
shrine at which to pray! And the
whole room is crimsoned with the light
diffused through the red hangings&mdash;significant
of blood and suffering....
Among other sacred articles in this hall
is the blood-stained crucifix of Bishop
Borie, whose interesting life has been
written by the Rev. F. Hewit.</p>

<p>One of the most affecting scenes related
in these books is when a band of
missionaries is about to leave for their
field of labor. On the eve of their departure,
the young apostles all stand before
the altar&mdash;victims ready for the glorious
sacrifice&mdash;and one by one the loved
companions and friends they are to leave
behind come up to prostrate themselves,
and kiss the feet of these heralds of salvation,
the whole congregation meanwhile
chanting: <i>Quam speciosi pedes evangelizantium
pacem, evangelizantium bona!</i>&mdash;How
beautiful are the feet of them who
preach the Gospel of peace, of them that
bring glad tidings of good things!</p>

<p>M. Vénard went to labor in Tonquin.
When the first missionary to that country&mdash;a
Dominican friar&mdash;landed there in
1596, he found a great cross on that unknown
shore, which seemed to prefigure
what awaited those who should attempt
to evangelize it. And to see how truly,
we need go no further back than 1861,
when, in the course of nine months, sixteen
thousand Christians were martyred
in only two provinces of Anam, and
twenty thousand condemned to perpetual
slavery. This was the year in which M.
Vénard was martyred. The letter he
wrote his beloved sister in his cage at
midnight on the eve of his martyrdom
has been styled by an eminent Frenchman
“one of the most beautiful pages
of the history of the martyrs of the XIXth
century.”</p>

<p>Henry Dorié was sent to Corea&mdash;the
very name of which is symbolical to the
Christian ear of persecution and martyrdom.
The whole history of the church
in that country is written in blood. Its
first missionaries were all martyrs, its
first bishop, its first converts. In one
year&mdash;1839&mdash;over eight hundred Christians
were martyred, and a still larger
number perished from want in the mountains
where they had taken refuge. But
M. Dorié had but one desire&mdash;when his
labors were ended, to win the palm. His
prayer was not denied him.</p>

<p>It is thus the sufferings of Christ are
daily perpetuated in some member of his
body in various parts of the world. We
should all have a share in this great sacrifice
of atonement, according to the
measure of our calling, if not by personal
labors, at least by our prayers
and contributions. England is taking
up the foreign missionary work.
America, too, should have her part in it.
Such a work would react on our own
hearts, and develop a self-denial and
generosity that would constrain us more
powerfully in promoting every good work
at home. As Archbishop Manning says:
“It is because we have need of men and
means at home that I am convinced we
ought to send both men and means
abroad&mdash;in exact proportion as we freely
give what we have freely received will
our works at home prosper, and the zeal
and number of our priests be multiplied.”</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c282" name="c282">The Money God</a></span>; or, The Empire and
the Papacy. A Tale of the Third Century.
By M. A. Quinton. Baltimore:
Kelly, Piet &amp; Co. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>The Empire and the Papacy</i>&mdash;a title of
fresh significance in these days. It is remarkable
how soon the Roman emperors
realized that their authority could not exist
in Rome with that of the pope, the importance
of whose office became more and
more apparent. The influence of the papacy
gradually widened, and so asserted itself
as to overshadow the very authority
of the emperor himself. It excited alarm.
Decius declared he would rather hear of
a rival springing up to contest for the
empire than of the election of a new bishop
of Rome. How notoriously eminent
must have been the dignity of that office
to excite such jealousy! Was it the
dread of this new mysterious power that
led so many of the emperors to exile
themselves, as it were, from their capital?
Though pope after pope lived in Rome,
and died there, even if by martyrdom, not
one emperor from the time of Heliogabalus
till Constantine ended his days in
that city. One was killed in Germany,
another strangled in Carthage, a third
slain in Thrace, a fourth killed by lightning
beyond the Tigris; not one died in
Rome. And for more than a century and
a half they resided elsewhere, hardly daring
to show themselves in the capital, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
they felt more and more their moral
isolation in the midst of the Roman people.
Diocletian went to Rome to be recognized
as emperor, but returned to Nicomedia.
When Maximian was made
his colleague and assumed the government
of Italy, he did not establish himself
at Rome, but chose Milan as his residence.
Constantine’s great object, after
triumphing over his enemies, was to
leave Rome and found a new capital.
“The same girdle could not enclose both
the emperor and the pontiff,” says M. de
Maistre; “Constantine gave up Rome to
the pope.” It was a moral necessity that
the papacy&mdash;a power “far above king,
law, or popular right,” should be free,
and this has never been contested with
impunity since.</p>

<p>In the work before us, the contrasting
influence of the empire and the papacy is
exemplified in the history of two boys
who were stolen from their mother in
Thrace and sold at Rome as slaves. Separated
in their childhood, one providentially
fell into the hands of Agatho, a
Christian hermit; the other gave himself
to the service of Plutus, the “Money
God.” We wish, for the sake of the
young into whose hands this book may
fall, that the early history of Eva, their
mother, had been somewhat veiled. It
affords, however, a strong contrast between
the violent, passionate courtesan
and the subdued and humble Christian
which she finally becomes. A confessor
of the faith, she fully redeems her early
career by a life of penitence. Her sad
form gives relief to that of Plautia, a noble
Christian matron. Tertullian tells us
how much Christianity improved the
condition of woman. No sage of antiquity
ever thought of developing her
spiritual nature and thereby giving her
greater moral elevation, but the humblest
Christian priest made this a duty. We
have only to read the writings of the Fathers,
particularly S. Jerome, to realize
the great renovation that took place in
woman’s nature when her soul was
awakened to higher aims and became
conscious of a holier destiny. The <i>Acts</i>
of the early martyrs set before us some
of the noblest types of womanhood.
There is a grandeur in their unalterable
serenity of soul under persecution, examples
of which are given in the book before
us. Indebted so greatly to the
Christian religion, woman became its efficient
supporter. We learn from Ammianus
Marcellinus that the first popes
were chiefly supported by the offerings
of the Roman matrons. Their devotion
to the service of the church is manifest
from the jealous exclamation of Diocletian:
“I hate, as a usurpation of my
powers, the influence of these Christian
priests over the matrons.”</p>

<p>This tale of the IIId century evinces
great familiarity on the part of the author
with classical and antiquarian lore as
well as the early Christian writers.</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c283" name="c283">The Nesbits</a></span>; or, A Mother’s Last Request,
and other Tales. By Uncle
Paul. New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">The first of these stories and the principal
one, <i>The Nesbits</i>, is a rapid sketch
of the life and fortunes of a young American,
none the less interesting and, it
may be hoped, true to nature because
the figure of the hero, Ned Nesbit, is exactly
the reverse of the “Young America”
of the popular imagination. He is honest,
manly, truthful, and religious; and it
may be a surprise to some readers to
find that those unusual characteristics
of “Young America” neither make him
insipid nor offer an insurmountable
barrier to his success in life. The scenes
of the story shift from the backwoods to
New Orleans, from New Orleans to
Mexico. There is plenty of fresh air, of
sea and sky, pleasant bits of Mexican
scenery and vistas of Mexican life; there
are camping out and long rides and
“brushes” with the Indians, hit off rapidly,
and though in an unpretentious
style, one admirably adapted to its purpose.
There is a pleasant and harmless
little love-plot that Uncle Paul’s chief
readers&mdash;the young folk&mdash;are likely to
vote “slow,” but they will find plenty
of other things more congenial to their
sanguinary tastes scattered throughout
the book, while the tone is thoroughly
Catholic from beginning to end. The
second story of the volume&mdash;“The Little
Sister of the Poor”&mdash;is a sketch, condensed
from the French, of a little
hunchback, who, finding her deformity
rather an obstacle to her walking pleasantly
in the ways of this world, and that
even a dower of 10,000 francs did not
serve to smooth it down, finally hides it
away in religion, and becomes “a little
sister.” The story would be very entertaining
only that it may tend to strengthen
the stupid idea so prevalent among non-Catholics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
that the nun’s habit is a good
covering for personal deformity, and
that a convent is a sort of receptacle for
ladies who can “do no better”: whereas,
God culls his flowers where he wills, and
women in convents are just the same as
women anywhere else, with the exception
that they have devoted their lives entirely
to God’s service. In his last story&mdash;“The
Orphan”&mdash;Uncle Paul has struck
upon a vein which might be worked with
as much profit as interest. It is a short,
indeed too short, sketch of a thing that
a few years back was of very common
occurrence in this country. An Irish
emigrant girl finds herself suddenly bereft
of her parents, and placed in the
keeping of a Protestant family. The author
has made her position superior to
that of the generality of her sisters under
similar circumstances; she is a ward rather
than a servant, and among friends
rather than enemies to her race and faith.
But even so, she finds herself, young and
friendless, placed amid the thousand
difficulties of Protestant surroundings.
Her triumph over them is very touchingly
told. The idea contained in this story
might be worked to much greater advantage;
and the tracing up some of those
poor children who were snatched away
and buried among heretical families,
which, even if acting with the very best
intentions, might consider the religion of
these orphans something they were bound
to abolish, would form a sadly interesting
story, and one which would take in
much of our recent Catholic history in
this country.</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c284" name="c284">Wild Times.</a></span> A Tale of the Days of
Queen Elizabeth. By Cecilia M. Caddell.
New York: The Catholic Publication
Society.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a new and handsome edition
of a story which, though it came out
some years back in London, is probably
unknown to very many of our readers.
It is just one of those books which Catholics
sadly stand in need of to adorn
and grace their, to a certain extent,
cumbersome literature. Miss Caddell
has been fortunate in her choice of <i>Wild
Times</i>, and <i>Wild Times</i> have been fortunate
in Miss Caddell. The period of the
Reformation forms for the Catholic of to-day
the most interesting one of English
history; and recent researches, such as
are exhibited in F. Morris’ late books
(<i>Our Catholic Forefathers</i>, and <i>The Condition
of Catholics under James I</i>.) and others
similar, are bringing that particular period
home to us with a clearness and
fulness of knowledge which tend to
make us acquainted with all the intricacies
and common details of life, particularly
Catholic life in those wild times,
as we are with the humdrum life of to-day.
Miss Caddell’s story is really the history
of one of the very few noble English Catholic
families who stood firm to their faith in
that dark hour, and who, for the simple
reason of being true to their God, were,
according to law, false to their sovereign
and country. The chief characters are
two young brothers, Sir Hugh and Amadée
Glenthorne, the latter a Jesuit educated
on the Continent, and returning by
stealth to the work of the ministry,
which at that time meant martyrdom;
the former a fiery, high-spirited English
gentleman, whose hot blood and lofty
aspirations cannot run tamely in the
dismal groove set him by the “law,” because
he happens to be a Catholic, but
who, when the hour of trial comes, and he
is weighed in the balance, is not found
wanting. Around these two, with their
charming sister Amy, the plot gathers;
and the tracing of their fortunes and
misfortunes makes a most beautiful and
moving tale. There are plenty of other
characters in the book: Blanche Monteman,
Hugh’s betrothed, and Guy, the
lover of Amy, both Protestants, give occasion
for some very skilfully constructed
complications; and the proud nature
of the girl, and the terrible fall of that
pride, are given with what the lady author
may allow to be called a masterhand.
There is also a weird gipsy queen,
Ulrique, who turns out eventually to be
something quite different, powerfully
drawn, whilst the premature death of the
mischievous little imp, Tom Tit, is as
touchingly told, if not more so, as that
of Little Paul Dombey. To enter into
the plot of the story further than has been
done would be to deprive the reader of
<i>Wild Times</i> of half the pleasure of a
story so skilfully woven that the interest
is sustained to the very last line, and its
development hidden until the author
chooses to disclose it. The style is of
the purest, occasionally rising to the
strongest, English. Miss Caddell has
mastered the old forms, without making
them as wearisome as some of Scott’s
Northern dialects cannot fail to be to the
unhappy uninitiated. The love in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
story is by no means of the namby-pamby
order, but good, and honest, and
true; in a word, manly and womanly in
the true sense of those words; and
though mainly carried on between Catholic
and Protestant, it serves for that
very reason to heighten the interest of
the story, and as here depicted seems a
very natural thing in those wild times;
whilst one has the hope all through that
earthly love will blend with a higher.
The gradual change effected in the blunt,
fiery character of Hugh by the chastening
hand of affliction, under which at
first he chafes till you fear for him, but
finally rises with all his strength of character
to the heroism of a Sebastian, is
as ably, though naturally and unconsciously,
developed as anything the writer
remembers seeing in this style of
book. The only thing he quarrels with
is the preface. Without being dogmatic
on the point, it is very doubtful whether,
“when the queen&mdash;Elizabeth&mdash;ascended
the throne, Catholicity was still the religion
of the great masses of the people,
and was either secretly followed or openly
professed by a large half of the noblest
families in the land.” English history
scarcely bears this out; and had only
one-half the noblest families in the land
been even secretly Catholics, still less
such Catholics as Hugh Glenthorne and
his brother, England would never have
sworn by a goddess in petticoats, and
Mr. Froude would never have felt compelled
to write his history. Again, when
the author speaks of “the brightest and
bravest of the band who form a halo of
glory round the throne of Queen Elizabeth,”
the reader involuntarily asks himself,
What band? And the very question
is its own answer. Still, a notice is not
for a preface; and however one may
quarrel with that, with the story itself no
fault can be found. It is a beautiful,
high-toned, moving picture of noble Catholic
struggle, suffering, and death,
drawn evidently with infinite pains and
after historic study, and with that highest
art which is nearest nature.</p>

By the author of <i>Marion Howard</i> and
<i>Maggie’s Rosary</i>. <span class="smcap">Wilfulness and its
Consequences.</span> By Lady Herbert.
New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">The little book before us is intended
for a premium-book for schools, and is
admirably adapted to this purpose. The
stories are thoroughly natural, and written
in a good, healthy Catholic spirit.
They are calculated to reach the masses
in the most satisfactory way which could
be chosen, that is, through their children.
A great deal is constantly said about the
authority of parents in the home, but we
should not forget the immense and preponderating
element of the children’s influence
on their parents. This, if used
in the right direction (which means, if
guided in that direction by the teacher)
may become of the utmost importance.
It may civilize many a half-savage unfortunate
who seems dead even to the
stings of his own conscience; it may turn
to serious reasoning the mind hitherto
careless, because not exercised on spiritual
things; it may shame into decency a
character not irredeemably bad, but overgrown
with the evil habits of half a century.
In <i>Peter’s Journey</i>, or a drunkard’s
dream, we see put into plain words the
devil’s plea against the victim of intemperance.
He claims him as his own by
<i>fair barter</i>. “When thou didst ask for
drink, did I not ask thee in return, not
only thy wife’s affection, thy children’s
happiness, thy home’s comfort, but, more
than all, did I not demand thy soul? <i>I
asked thee openly, and thou didst willingly
agree....</i> Well, didst thou not have
the drink, morning, noon, and night?
<i>And if so, shall I not have my price in
full?</i>” This is a dark, but far from
overwrought picture. Yet the mercy of
God is greater than even such malicious
sins, and till the very last the “pearly
shadow” of his angel guardian protects
the poor sinner. Peter awakes, and a
sudden reformation is at hand. The
poor wife, breaking down under her
troubles, is weary and fretful, but Peter
does not heed this, and in his stormy exit
is only stopped by the baby, who is
“examining the handle [of the door] with
an attention worthy of an amateur locksmith.”
Peter raised it in his arms, looked
at it for a moment, and then, kissing it
almost reverently, gave it to Mike and
clumped down-stairs. “Poor Norah
hoped he had not got <i>delirium tremens</i>.”
It was a long time before Peter came
back; when he did, it was behind the
rampart of a large basket bursting with
eatables. He goes down on his knees to
his wife and begs forgiveness in the most
charmingly abrupt and natural way, and
when Norah recovers from a fainting-fit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
everything is bright and happy again.
“Certain it is that, when the <i>Angelus</i>
rang, it found them sitting side by side,
shelling peas, and the baby on his knee,
chuckling over a stick of rhubarb that it
expected every one to smell every five
minutes.” And what is the end? A
triumph for Peter, and a hopeful example
for all those who are honestly trying to
follow in his footsteps. “In the whole
parish there is not a cleaner house, better
children, or a happier wife than Peter’s....
He collects the subscriptions for
the schools, takes the money in church,
carries the big banner at processions,
and seems to do the work of half a dozen
men made into one.... Is there a
drunkard to reclaim, Peter is the man
to take him in hand, depend upon it. Is
there a drunkard’s widow struggling with
her little ones alone, Peter will help her
and put her in a way to get her living
... and he thanks God for all things,
for his home, his little ones, his means of
doing good, but, more than all, he thanks
him for his wife Norah, and for a journey
he took, of which he never speaks, on
the Feast of S. Peter and S. Paul.”</p>

<p>Of the “other tales,” we much prefer
“A Carpenter’s Holiday.” The evils of
bad companionship are here depicted,
the absurd temptations which human respect
thrusts in the path of young and
often weak men, the manliness and true
Anglo-Saxon spirit which even outsiders
recognize in a firm refusal to yield to such
temptations. The character of Sam is
very interesting, and the history of his
conversion quite a natural one. A lesson
here and there is worth taking from it.
For instance, the Catholic carpenter says
to his friend, “People talk so much about
our flowers and candles that really one
would think they was a great part of our
religion, <i>and, as it is, they’re just nothing</i>.”
The old lesson of the example of converts
is also well put forward. The end
is, of course, an introduction to an earthly
paradise, in the shape of a snug little
farm, “the house hidden by roses, jasmine,
ivy, and honeysuckle ... a dear,
large, old-fashioned garden, with its
apple and pear trees, its currant and
gooseberry bushes, and its bed of flowers
and cabbages, never thinking, as grand
people’s flowers and cabbages seem to
think, that they are not fit company for
each other.” We are inclined to think
that, if all discontented, restless people
believed this sort of thing to be the inevitable
reward of virtue, they would immediately
become virtuous and leave off
being discontented and restless. <i>We</i>
should, at any rate. And if this kind of
life was the ending to which all good
carpenters who spent their early holidays
properly had a chance of attaining, why,
then, we should be much freer than we
are from trades-union strikes and International
Associations. “The Carpenter’s
Holiday” is the story most full of human
interest and natural incident among all
the little group by the author of <i>Maggie’s
Rosary</i>.&mdash;We now come to Lady Herbert’s
story of <i>Wilfulness</i>. This is an extract
from the diary of a Sister of Mercy, and
reveals one of the many phases of silent
misery of which a large city is always
full. The story is interesting if only as
a picture of the heroism, the sacrifices,
the sufferings, and the charity of people
in humble, struggling circumstances, who
could never hope to have their virtues
set before an admiring public, and whose
only motive was evidently the love of
God and reverent trust in his divine
providence. The last days of the heroine
are touchingly told, her unselfishness in
behalf of her father especially. “Every
shilling which had been given her to
spend in the little comforts so urgently
required, had been hoarded up by her
for this long-expected situation, when
she was determined that her father’s appearance
should do no discredit to his
kind recommender. ‘Only think,’ she
continued, ‘I had enough for everything
but one pair of boots, and I could not
conceive where that eighteen shillings
was to come from. But I set to work
and prayed one whole night for it, and
the next morning a young priest came to
see me, and brought me a sovereign,
which he said a gentleman had given
him that very day to give to his first sick
call!’”</p>

A Summer Tour to the Plains and New

1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This is the fourth edition of this excellent
book, which is now published by The
Catholic Publication Society. As we
noticed this book at some length in <span class="smcap">The
Catholic World</span> for February, 1868, we
can only reiterate what we then said, viz.:</p>

<p>“There is just about enough fact to make the
work decently solid, a good deal of fancy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
impression, and, above all, a light hand. The
style as a whole is really good, because it does
pretty evenly just what it attempts and professes&mdash;sometimes
more, seldom less. The descriptions
of Denver and Central City, and the account
of the Pueblos of New Mexico, interested
us especially&mdash;the former for its manner, the
latter for its interesting and curious facts. But
another reader would call our selection invidious,
and cite quite another set of incidents. The
fact is, Mr. Meline is everywhere vivid, easy,
and suggestive, and we do think we like those
two parts best because we have friends in Denver
and take a special interest in the old Poltec
question.”</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c287" name="c287">Proceedings</a> of the Fourth Annual
Convention of the Irish Catholic
Benevolent Union, held at Philadelphia,
October 16-18, 1872; together
with the Constitution, Addresses,
etc.</span> Philadelphia: Office of
the <i>Catholic Standard</i>. 1872.</p>

<p class="p1">This was a convention of the representatives
of nearly 20,000 Catholic workingmen.
These men, living in different parts
of the country, are organized into numerous
beneficial societies, each independent
for its own purposes and government, yet
enjoying a fellowship with all the others
for the sake of mutual benefit. The Benevolent
Union makes these men each
others’ friends, in sickness and in death,
in any part of the country where a society
exists. We say it makes them friends&mdash;we
might better say brothers; for attention
and support in sickness and Catholic
burial after death are acts more than friendly.
Any society which is beneficial and
composed exclusively of practical Catholics,
can become associated on payment
of five dollars initiation fee, and not to
exceed twenty-five cents a year for each
member&mdash;this tax last year having been
but ten cents. From these sources a fund
is raised to pay the expenses of the conventions
and a very small salary to the
secretary and treasurer. Any member
away from home is entitled to recognition
by simply presenting his travelling card.
In case of sickness, it entitles him to
receive from any affiliated society whatever
aid his own would give him, and in
case of death, to the expenditure of the
same amount for his funeral as would
have been allowed at home. Expenses
thus incurred are refunded by the society
to which the recipient belonged.</p>

<p>The mere statement of these advantages
suffices to explain the extraordinary success
which has attended the Union. Begun
in the little city of Dayton, Ohio,
with a small number of societies, it has in
four years extended itself in every direction;
sometimes creating new societies,
sometimes affiliating old ones, everywhere
attracting great attention and eliciting
the warmest encouragement; until it is
not too much to say of it now that it is
one of the great beneficial institutions of
the country. At the last convention, the
President of the Philadelphia City Council
extended a public welcome to the
delegates. The proceedings were opened
by a sermon from the distinguished Jesuit
Father Maguire, and the speeches and
debates were orderly and dignified, and
sometimes eloquent, the most important
questions being discussed and decided
expeditiously and without ill-temper.
Among other things, we noticed that
measures were instituted looking to the
settlement of immigrants in favorable
places, and to their safety and comfort
while in transit. A full and minute
account was rendered of the receipt and
disbursement of the common fund, and
expression frankly and powerfully given
to the unanimous sentiment of the societies
with regard to Catholic education,
and of sympathy with the Holy Father in
his present distress. There was no evidence
whatever of any spirit of rivalry;
on the contrary, a committee was appointed
to negotiate for the extension of the
benefits of the Benevolent Union among
other Catholic bodies.</p>

<p>These large assemblages of intelligent
and zealous Catholics supply one of the
greatest wants of the church. After business
matters are fairly disposed of, the
convention becomes a great Catholic
representative body&mdash;not indeed to make
laws or to enforce them, but to give voice
to the thoughts of the Catholic laity on
questions which concern the general welfare
of the church. Never did the clergy,
from the Pope down to the parish priest,
stand in greater need of the encouragement
of the faithful, and never before
have the faithful exhibited greater alacrity
in giving it. Such gatherings as these
are the best support which the church
nowadays can have in resisting oppression
and securing her rights. We therefore
pray God to give this Benevolent
Union a great success; and we are at a
loss to perceive why such should not be
the prayer of every good Catholic. The
organization of a branch society in a parish
will be the best preventive of Freemasonry
and other condemned societies;
it will secure the poor man and his family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
from want in case of sickness or accident
at home or among strangers; it will give
the priest and the educated layman an
audience outside the church for the advocacy
of Catholic public rights; and at
least once a year the convention will
exhibit to the American public, in a most
striking manner, the unity, the charity,
the patriotism, and the power of the
Catholic people of this country.</p>

1871. By Eliza Greatorex. Munich:

1872. New York: Putnam.</p>

<p class="p1">Many books have been published
about Ober-Ammergau and its Passion-Play.
This one is not, however, a mere
repetition of their substance under a
different form. It is altogether different
in substance, and, therefore, a really new
as well as most interesting description.
The accomplished author does not occupy
her pages with an account of the
play itself, but takes us into the homes
of the actors, and among the scenes
of that picturesque German village.
Though she is not a Catholic, her heart
is full of kindliness, sympathy, and reverence,
and we have read her truly exquisite
portrayal of the primitive and
most Christian life of the favored inhabitants
of Ammergau with pleasure and admiration.
The etchings are in the style
of the best and truest art. The author
has been honored by an autograph letter
from the King of Bavaria, who, in spite
of his faults as a ruler, is a man of taste
and cultivation in the fine arts, and by a
very kind reception at the private audience
which was granted to her by the
august Pius IX. We recommend this
beautiful volume very cordially to all
lovers of art, and of the most genuine,
simple, and charming phases of nature
and of Catholic piety which are to be
found in the modern world, which is so
full of glaring but empty illusions. As
the edition in the hands of the New York
publisher is a small one, those who desire
to procure a copy would do well to
be in haste about ordering it from the
publisher.</p>

<p class="p1">The following, taken from the preface
of the work, is a synopsis of this
little play: Julius is exposed in Paris at
the age of ten by his uncle, who procures
a written evidence of the boy’s death, and
then seizes upon his property. The Abbé
De l’Epée, Director of the Deaf and
Dumb Asylum in Paris, finds the youth,
and educates him. Suspecting the boy
to be of noble blood, he bestows all his
care on the helpless deaf-mute during
eight years, creates his soul anew, as it
were, and in the meantime endeavors to
find out the place of his birth. For this
purpose the Abbé travels with his protégé
over a great part of France, and
finally arrives at Toulouse, which city
the young man recognizes as the place of
his home. The Abbé consults the young
lawyer Frauval, a friend of St. Alme,
who is the son of Julius’s uncle. Darlemont
refuses to recognize his nephew,
but is at last prevailed upon to restore
Julius to his rightful inheritance, by the
threatened exposure of his son St. Alme.
So the matter is settled amicably, and
Julius grants to St. Alme, his former
playmate, half of his estate.</p>

<p class="p2 reduct">“No breath of calumny ever attainted the personal purity of Savonarola.”&mdash;<i>Henry Hart Milman,
Dean of S. Paul’s.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> bright and shining fame of
Girolamo Savonarola, the man upon
whom, in the XVth century, the
wondering attention of the whole
civilized world was admiringly fixed,
fell during the XVIIIth century into
oblivion or contempt&mdash;a not uncommon
fate in that period for religious
reputations and religious works.
The generally received opinion concerning
him was that of the sceptic
Bayle, who, with show of impartiality
and phrase of fairness (‘Opinion is
divided as to whether he was an honest
man or a hypocrite’), but with
cold and cruel cynicism, covered
the unhappy Dominican with his
sharpest and most pungent sarcasm,
leaving the reader to infer that he
was a mean impostor, who most probably
deserved the martyrdom he suffered.</p>

<p>In our own day, Dean Milman,
of the Established Church of England,
asks:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Was he a hypocritical impostor, self-deluded
fanatic, holy, single-minded
Christian preacher, heaven-commissioned
prophet, wonder-working saint? Martyr,
only wanting the canonization which
was his due? Was he the turbulent,
priestly demagogue, who desecrated his
holy office by plunging into the intrigue
and strife of civic politics, or a courageous
and enlightened lover of liberty?”</p>

<p class="p1">And&mdash;unkindest cut of all&mdash;punishment
transcending in degree the
worst faults and most terrible crimes
of which he has been unjustly accused
by his most cruel enemies&mdash;modern
German Protestantism has
placed him in bronze effigy in company
with the bigamous Landgrave
Philip of Hesse, and with Prince
Frederick of Saxony, on the monument
at Worms, as one of the predecessors
and helpers of Luther. The
ascetic Savonarola the acolyte of the
beery Monk of Wittenberg! The
chaste Dominican the inferior of the
sensual Reformer! The ecclesiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
who, in the flower of his manhood

faith<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> in which he lived and died,
the aider and precursor of the archheresiarch!</p>

<p>Truly, so far as the judgment of
this world is concerned, one hour of
the degradation of Worms is sufficient
to have cancelled all his sins.
Poor Savonarola!</p>

<p>Jerome Savonarola, born in Ferrara,
in 1452 (Sept. 21), was the son
of Nicholas Savonarola. His mother
Helen was of the Buonaccorsi
family of Mantua, and his paternal
grandfather a physician of Padua of
such high reputation that Nicholas,
Prince of Este, induced him, by the
bestowal of honors and a pension, to
come to Ferrara. Jerome’s youth
was serious and studious, and, under
the fostering care of one of the best
of mothers, his character developed
favorably. At the age of ten, he
went to the public school of his native
city, and it was intended that he
should complete the usual studies
necessary to his becoming a physician.</p>

<p>The traveller of to-day, who sees
the deserted squares and grass-grown
streets of Ferrara, can form but little
idea of the Ferrara of that period; a
splendid city of one hundred thousand
inhabitants, possessing one of
the most brilliant courts of Italy, and
witnessing the frequent passage of
princes, emperors, and popes, whose
presence gave constant occasion for
pageants, processions, and banquets.
The young Jerome, it was noticed,
sought none of these, but was fond
of lonely walks and solitude, even
avoiding the beautiful promenades in
the gardens of the ducal palace.</p>

<p>He pursued his medical studies for
some time, but his favorite reading
was found in the works of Aristotle
and S. Thomas Aquinas. Long
years afterward, he said of the latter:
“When I was in the world, I held
him in the greatest reverence. I have
always kept to his teaching, and,
whenever I wish to feel small, I read
him, and he always appears to me as
a giant, and I to myself as a dwarf.”
Although, like most youths of his
age, he indulged in making verses,
his were not of the ordinary callow
model. One of his short youthful
poems which survived him was on
the spread of sceptical philosophy
and the decay of virtue. “Where,”
he asks&mdash;“where are the pure diamonds,
the bright lamps, the sapphires,
the white robes, and white
roses of the church?” Such language,
taken in connection with his
declaration at the time that he would
never become a monk, shows that
the idea, although in a negative
form, was already working in his
mind. He afterwards related that,
being at Faenza one day, he by
chance entered the church of S. Augustine,
and heard a remarkable word
fall from the lips of the preacher.
“I will not tell you what it was,” he
added, “but it is here, graven on my
heart. One year afterwards, I became
a religious.”</p>

<p>Modern novels and the average
silly judgment of worldly people in
such matters are usually unable to
comprehend why any man or woman
should enter a convent unless they
are what is called “crossed in love.”
Some such story is related of Savonarola,
and Milman says of it: “There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
is a vague story, resting on but slight
authority, that Savonarola was the
victim of a tender but honorable passion
for a beautiful female.” We
should also incline to be of the same
opinion, were it not that Villari<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> refers
to it as having some foundation.
He says that, in 1472, a Florentine
exile, bearing the illustrious name of
Strozzi, and his daughter, took up
their abode next to the dwelling of
Savonarola’s family. The mere fact
that he was an exile from Dante’s
native city was sufficient to excite
Savonarola’s sympathies. He imagined
him oppressed by the injustice
of enemies, suffering for his country
and for the cause of liberty. His
eyes met those of the Florentine
maiden. Overflowing with confident
hope, he revealed his heart to her.
What was his bitter disappointment
on receiving a disdainful answer rejecting
him, and giving him at the
same time to understand that the
house of Strozzi could not lower itself
by condescending to an alliance
with the family of Savonarola. He
resented the insult with honest indignation,
but, says his chronicler,
<i>il suo cuore ne restó desolato</i>&mdash;“his
heart was broken.” This may all
be, but certain it is that the disappointed
youth did not instantly rush
into a convent to bury his blasted
hopes. On the contrary, the incident
of the sermon at Faenza occurred
nearly two years afterward. On
this circumstance he frequently
dwelt, saying that a word, <i>una parola</i>,
of the preacher still strongly affected
him, but he always reserved it as a
sort of mysterious secret even from
his most intimate friends.</p>

<p>In returning from Faenza, he was
light of heart, but found, on reaching
home, that a hard trial was before
him. It was necessary to conceal
his intention from his parents, but
his mother, as though she read his
secret, would fix her eyes upon him
with a gaze which seemed to penetrate
his very soul. This struggle
went on for a year, and Savonarola
often refers to his mental sufferings
during that period. “If I had made
known my resolution,” he says, “I
believe my heart must have broken,
and I should have allowed myself to
be shaken in my purpose.” Again,
on another day, the 22d of April,
1475, Jerome, seating himself, took
a lute, and played an air so sad that
his mother, turning to him suddenly,
as if moved by the spirit of prophecy,
said to him in a tone of sorrow:
“My dear son, that is a farewell
song.” With great effort, the young
man continued to play with trembling
hand, but dared not raise his eyes
from the ground.</p>

<p>The next day, April 23, was the
feast of S. George, a great festival
for all Florence. Savonarola had
fixed upon it to leave his father’s
house, and, as soon as the religious
ceremonies of the morning were
over, he quitted home, and made his
way to Bologna, where he knocked
for admittance at the</p>

<p class="pc1">CONVENT OF THE DOMINICANS.</p>

<p class="pn1">He was then just twenty-two and a
half years old. Announcing his desire
to enter on his novitiate, he wished,
he said, to be employed in the
most menial of the offices of the
community, and to be the servant of
all the others. Being admitted, he
seized his first leisure moment that
same day to write a long and affectionate
letter to his father, in which
he sought to comfort him and explain
the step he had taken. It is a
memorable letter:</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>: I fear my departure
from home has caused you much sorrow&mdash;the
more so that I left you furtively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Permit me to explain my motives. You
who so well know how to appreciate the
perishable things of earth, judge not
with passion like a woman, but, guided
by truth, judge according to reason whether
I am not right in carrying out my
project and abandoning the world. The
motive determining me to enter on a
religious life is this: the great misery of
the world, the iniquities of men, the
crimes, the pride, the shocking blasphemies,
by which the world is polluted, for
there is none that doeth good&mdash;no, not
one. Often and daily have I uttered this
verse with tears:</p>

<p class="pc1">‘Heu fuge crudelas terras! Fuge littus avarum.’</p>

<p class="pn1">I could not support the wickedness of
the people. Everywhere I saw virtue
despised, and vice honored. No greater
suffering could I have in this world.
Wherefore every day I prayed our Lord
Jesus Christ to lift me out of this mire.
It has pleased God in his infinite mercy
to show me the right way, and I have
entered upon it, although unworthy of
such a grace. Sweet Jesus, may I suffer
a thousand deaths rather than oppose
thee and show myself ungrateful! Thus,
my dear father, far from shedding tears,
you should thank our Lord Jesus, for he
has given you a son, has preserved him
to you up to the age of twenty-two, and
has deigned to admit him among his
knights militant. Can you imagine that
I have not endured the greatest affliction
in separating from you? Never have I
suffered such mental torment as in abandoning
my own father to make the sacrifice
of my body to Jesus Christ, and to
surrender my will into the hands of persons
I had never seen. In mercy, then,
most loving father, dry your tears, and add
not to my pain and sorrow. I am satisfied
with what I have done, and I would
not return to the world even with the certainty
of becoming greater than Cæsar.
But, like you, I am of flesh and blood;
the senses wage war with reason, and I
must struggle furiously with the assaults
of the devil.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> They will soon pass by,
these first sad days, bitterest in the freshness
of their grief, and I trust we will be
consoled by grace in this world, and
glory in the next. Comfort my mother, I
beseech you, of whom, with yourself, I
entreat your blessing.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In the convent at Bologna, Savonarola
spent seven years. During
his novitiate, his conduct was the
admiration of all his brethren. They
wondered at his modesty, his humility,
and his faultless obedience.
He appeared to be entirely absorbed
in ecstatic contemplation of heavenly
things, and to have no other desire
than to be allowed to pass his time
in prayer and humble obedience. To
one looking at him walking in the
cloisters, he had more the appearance
of a shadow than of a living man,
so much was he emaciated by abstinence
and fasts. The severest trials
of the novitiate seemed light to him,
and his superiors had frequently to
restrain his self-imposed denials.
Even when not fasting, he ate hardly
enough to sustain life. His bed was
of rough wood with a sack of straw
and one coarse sheet; his clothes,
the plainest possible, but always scrupulously
neat. In personal appearance,
Savonarola was of middle stature,
dark, of sanguine-bilious temperament,
and of extraordinary nervous
sensibility. His eyes flamed
from beneath dark eyebrows; his
nose was aquiline, mouth large, lips
thick but firmly compressed, and
manifesting an immovable determination
of purpose. His forehead was
already marked with deep furrows,
indicating a mind absorbed in the
contemplation of grave subjects. Of
beauty of physiognomy there was
none, but it bore the expression of
severe dignity. A certain sad smile,
passing over his rough features, gave
them a kindly expression which inspired
confidence at first sight. His
manners were simple and uncultivated;
his discourse, plain to roughness,
became at times so eloquent
and powerful that it convinced or
subdued every one.</p>

<p>As Savonarola advanced in his
studies, he devoted all the time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
could possibly spare to the writings
of the Fathers and to the Holy Scriptures.
There are no less than four
different copies of the Bible still existing
in the libraries of Florence,
and a fifth in the library of S. Mark,
in Venice, of which the margins are
covered with Latin notes written by
him, which are excessively abridged,
and in a writing so fine as to be
read only with difficulty. According
to the custom of the order, the young
monk was in due time sent out on
the mission, that is, to different cities
and towns, to preach and exercise his
other clerical duties. In 1482, he
was ordered to Ferrara, whither he
went, very much against his will. His
relatives desired that he should remain
there, in order to be near his
family. Referring to this, he wrote
to his mother: “I could not do as
much good at Ferrara as elsewhere.
It is seldom that a religious succeeds
in his native place. Hence it is that
the Scripture commands us to go
forth into the world. A stranger is
better received everywhere. No one
is a prophet in his own country.
Even concerning Christ, they asked:
‘Is not this the son of the carpenter?’
As to me, it would be inquired,
‘Is not this Master Jerome, who
committed such and such sins, and
who was not a whit better than ourselves?
Ah! we know him.’”</p>

<p class="pc1">THE CONVENT OF S. MARK.</p>

<p class="p1">From Ferrara, Fra Hieronimo
was sent to the Convent of S. Mark,
at Florence. A mass of saintly and
artistic recollections cluster around
the history of this convent. Holy
men passed their lives within its
austere cloisters, and eminent artists
here consecrated their works by
Christian inspiration. It is sufficient
to mention from among them the
names of Fra Angelico, whose admirable
frescoes adorn its walls, of Fra
Bartolomeo, known to the world as
Baccio della Porta, the equal of
Andrea del Sarto, of Fra Benedetto,
and of the brothers Luke and Paul
della Robbia. Villari dwells on one
of its greatest illustrations, F. Sant’
Antonino, the founder or renewer of
nearly all the charitable institutions
of Florence, and in particular of the
Buoni Uomini di San Martino, which
exists to this day in all its beautiful
Christian edification, if, haply, the
tide of modern progress, under Victor
Emmanuel, have not swept it away.</p>

<p>F. Sant’ Antonino’s memory is still
cherished there as that of a man
burning with divine charity, and consumed
with the love of his neighbor.
His death, which took place in 1459,
was deplored in Florence as a public
calamity.</p>

<p>The early history of the convent is
closely connected with that of Cosmo
de’ Medici, who was its munificent
patron. Besides large amounts spent
on the building, he made them a
still more valuable donation. Niccolo
Niccoli, a name well known to
scholars, a collector of manuscripts
of European fame, had spent his life
and a large fortune in making a collection
of valuable manuscripts which
was the admiration of all Italy. At
his death, he bequeathed it to the
public, but the donation was useless
by reason of the heavy debts against
his estate. Cosmo paid them, and,
retaining for himself a few of the
most precious documents, gave all
the rest to the convent. This was
the first public library in Italy, and it
was cared for by the monks in a
manner which proved them worthy
of the gift they had received. S.
Mark became, as it were, a centre
of learning, and not only the most
learned monks of its affiliated convents
in Northern Italy, but the most
distinguished men of that period,
sought every occasion to frequent it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Savonarola’s arrival in the Florentine
convent had been preceded by
his reputation for learning and for
piety. It was even said of him that
he had made some miraculous conversions,
and the story was told that,
in making the journey from Ferrara
to Mantua by the river, he had been
shocked by the obscene ribaldry of
the boatmen. He turned upon them
with terrible earnestness, and, after
half an hour of his impressive exhortation,
eleven of them threw themselves
at his feet, confessing their sins,
and humbly demanding his pardon.</p>

<p>Savonarola was at first delighted
with all he saw of Florence. The
delicious landscape bounded by the
soft outline of the Tuscan hills, the
elegance of language, the manners
of the people, which appeared to
increase in refinement and courtesy
as you approached Florence, all had
predisposed him to find delight in
this flower of Italian cities, where
nature and art rival each other in
beauty. To his mind, so strongly
imbued with the religious feeling,
Florentine art seemed like a strain
of sacred music, attesting the omnipotence
of genius inspired by faith.
The paintings of Fra Angelico appeared
to him to have summoned
the angels to take up their abode in
these cloisters; and, gazing at them,
the young religious was transported
into a world of bliss. The holy traditions
of Sant’ Antonino and of his
works of charity were still fresh
among the brethren, and everything
appeared to draw him closer to them.
His heart was filled with hopes of
better days, he forgot his former disappointments,
as well as the possibility
that there might be fresh ones in
store for him when in time he came
to know the Florentines better.</p>

<p class="pc1">LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT.</p>

<p class="p1">When Savonarola came to Florence,
Lorenzo the Magnificent had
been its ruler for many years, and
was then at the apogee of his fame
and his power. Under his sway<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
everything looked prosperous and
happy. The struggles that formerly
convulsed the city had long ceased.
Those who refused to bend to the
domination of the Medici were imprisoned,
exiled, or dead. All was
peace and tranquillity. Feasts, dances,
and tournaments filled up the leisure
of this Florentine people, who, once
so jealous of their rights, now seemed
to have forgotten the very name of
liberty. Lorenzo participated in all
these diversions, and even exerted
himself to invent new ones. Among
these were the <i>Canti Carnascialeschi</i>,
first written by him and sung by the
young nobility and gentry of Florence
in the masquerades of the
Carnival. Nothing perhaps can
better depict the corruption of the
period than these songs. At this
day not only educated young men,
but the lowest of the populace, would
hold them in scorn, and their repetition
in public would be an offence
against decency swiftly to be suppressed
by the police. And yet
such were the occupations of predilection
of a prince praised by all, and
considered as the model of a sovereign,
a prodigy of courtesy, a political
and literary genius. And there
are those who are to-day inclined to
think of him as he was then looked
upon, to pardon him the blood cruelly
spilled to maintain a power unjustly
acquired by him and his, the
ruin of the republic, the violence
by which he forced from the community
the sum necessary for his
reckless expenditure, the shameless
libertinism to which he abandoned
himself, and even the rapid and infernal
corruption of the people which
he studied to maintain with all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
force and mental capacity.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> And all
this must be pardoned him forsooth,
because he was the protector of literature
and the fine arts!</p>

<p>Among all the Italian historians
who have painted Florence at this
epoch, there is but little difference
except in the variety and depth of
the colors used by them. Bruto
writes, and what he says is neither
useless nor irrelevant reading if, as
we progress in his description, we
bear in mind to what extent it may
be applied to New York in the year
1873 as well as to Florence in 1482.
“The Florentines,” he says, “seeking
to live in idleness and ease, broke
with the traditions of their ancestors,
and in immoderate and shameful
license fell into the way of the
most disgraceful and detestable vices.
Their fathers, by dint of labor, fatigue,
virtue, abstinence, and probity, had
made the country flourish. They,
on the contrary, as if they had cast
aside all shame, seemed to have
nothing to lose: they gave themselves
up to drinking, gambling, and the
most ignoble pleasures. Lost in debauch,
they had shameless intrigues
and daily orgies. They were stained
with all wickedness, all crime. General
contempt of law and justice
assured them complete impunity.
Courage consisted in audacity and
temerity; ease of manner, in a culpable
complaisance; politeness, in
gossip and scandal.”</p>

<p class="pc1">SAVONAROLA IN FLORENCE.</p>

<p class="p1">In consideration of his acquirements,
Fra Hieronimo, was appointed
a teacher of the novices, and held
the position for four years (1482-1486).
In 1483, owing either to a
want of preachers or to the high
opinion formed of him from his success
as a professor, he was appointed
to preach the course of Lenten sermons
at the church of S. Lawrence.
Meantime, what he had learned of
the Florentines from personal observation
had not tended to raise them in
his estimation. He had discovered
that, in spite of their finished education
and highly cultivated intellects, their
hearts were filled with scepticism, and
an ever-present sarcasm hovered on
their lips. This want of faith and of
high principles caused him to shrink
anew into himself, and his disappointment
was the greater as it contrasted
so keenly with the hopes he entertained
on entering Florence. With
these feelings he for the first time
ascended a Florentine pulpit. Hardly
twenty-five people came to hear him
a second time. Twenty-five persons!
They could hardly be seen in the
vast building. His voice was feeble,
his intonations false, his gestures
awkward, his style heavy. His
preaching was a failure. But he was
not discouraged, and was anxious to
make another attempt. His superiors,
not caring to renew the experiment
in Florence, sent him to San Gemignano
for two years. He made no
attempt to change his style. The
Florentines had been accustomed to
preachers who carefully studied the
elocutionary part of their sermons,
many of them seeking to form themselves
upon some classical mould,
and their delivery was generally
polished and graceful. Savonarola
despised these aids, and thundered in
his rough, uncultivated way, against
scandals and want of faith, speaking
with scorn of the modern poets
and philosophers, and despising their
fanaticism for the classics. The
Bible he quoted profusely, and made
it the foundation of all his sermons.
His success at San Gemignano was
by no means a decided one, nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
it was sufficient to give him
confidence in himself, and to confirm
the course he had marked out for himself
as a preacher. Returning to his
convent, he continued to fulfil his
modest duties as reader or professor
until 1486, when by his superiors he
was</p>

<p class="pc1">SENT TO LOMBARDY,</p>

<p class="pn1">where he remained four years. These
four years are the most obscure of
his life. It is known, however, that
during this period he preached in various
cities of that country, and especially
at Brescia. Here his power in
the pulpit first fully revealed itself.
He preached on the Apocalypse.
With fervid words, imperious accents,
and impressive voice, he reproached
the people with their sins, and threatened
them with the anger of God.
Making startling application of the
prophecies to Brescia itself, they
should see, he told them, their city a
prey to furious enemies, who would
make their streets run rivers of blood.
Crime and cruelty would visit them
in their worst shape, and everything
would be delivered up to terror, fire,
and destruction. His menaces appalled
them, and his voice appeared
to come from another world. These
prophecies were recalled when, a
few years later, in 1512, Brescia was
taken by assault by the French
troops under Gaston de Foix, and
the city sacked and devastated with
the most dreadful barbarity. Six
thousand of its inhabitants were
killed.</p>

<p>Savonarola is next heard of at
Reggio, in 1486, where a chapter of
Dominicans was convened for the
discussion of certain questions of
theology and discipline. A number
of learned laymen were also present,
attracted by the prospect of theological
discussion. Among these was
the celebrated Pico di Mirandola,
then only twenty-three, but already
famous as a prodigy of intelligence
and learning. He was struck by the
appearance of Savonarola before the
monk had said a word, and had noted
his pallid countenance, and sunken
eyes, and forehead ploughed with
furrows of thought. In the theological
debate, Savonarola took no
part, but when the question of discipline
came up he spoke and thundered.
What he said left upon Mirandola
the impression that he beheld
an extraordinary man, and on his
arrival at Florence some time afterward,
he besought Lorenzo de’ Medici
to have Savonarola recalled to
Florence.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> After preaching at Bologna
and Pavia, and delivering a
course of Lenten sermons at Genoa,
he was, at the instance of Lorenzo,
recalled by his superiors to Florence,
in 1490. Thus it was that the bitterest
enemy of the Medici, the subverter
of their power, was by one of
themselves invited to return. Notwithstanding
his discernment Lorenzo
little knew what sad disasters he was
preparing for his house, or what a
flame he was kindling in the convent
which his ancestors had built. In
order to give an example of the
Christian simplicity he preached, Fra
Hieronimo made the journey home
on foot, and, owing to physical weakness,
accomplished only with difficulty
his</p>

<p class="pc1">RETURN TO FLORENCE.</p>

<p class="pn1">In his convent he quietly resumed
his functions of reader. There was
no question of his preaching, for he
had not forgotten the icy indifference
of the Florentines. Devoting himself
sedulously to the instruction of
his novices, they became the objects
of his tender care and of his fondest
wishes. Meantime his powers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
increased and his fame had spread.
It was echoed from Northern Italy,
and confirmed by Mirandola. Gradually
the professed brothers of
the convent joined the novices in
listening to Savonarola’s lectures,
and scholars and learned men of the
city demanded permission to be admitted
to them. Among those was
his adviser Pico. The study-room
in which he gave his lectures was no
longer sufficient to hold the crowd.
The garden of the convent was then
taken possession of, and there, under
the shade of a bush of damask roses,
carefully renewed to this day by the
brothers of the convent with religious
veneration, he continued his lessons.
His subject was the exposition of the
Apocalypse. The crowd of his hearers
still increased, and it was proposed
to the Prior of S. Mark that
Fra Hieronimo should continue his
lectures in the church. This was accorded,
and on Sunday, August 1,
1490, crowds flocked to hear the
preacher, who, formerly so much despised
in Florence, had gained such
a reputation in other parts of Italy.
From an account of it left by himself,
he that day preached a terrible sermon.
He continued his explanation
of the Apocalypse. The walls rang
with his terrible conclusions, he succeeded
in communicating to the excited
multitude the impetuosity of his
own feelings, his voice seemed to
them superhuman. The success of
that day was complete. Nothing
else was talked of in all Florence,
and the literati for a short time forgot
Plato to discuss the merits of the
new Christian preacher. Here is his
own account of the event:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“On the first day of August of this year,
1490, I began publicly to expound the
Apocalypse in our church of S. Mark.
During the course of the year, I continued
to develop to the Florentines these
three propositions 1. ‘That the church
would be renewed in our time.’ 2. ‘Before
that renovation, God would strike all
Italy with a fearful chastisement.’ 3. ‘That
these things would happen shortly.’ I
labored to demonstrate these three points
to my hearers, and to persuade them by
probable arguments, by allegories drawn
from sacred Scripture, by other similitudes
and parables drawn from what was
going on in the church. I insisted on
reasons of this kind; and I dissembled
the knowledge which God gave me of
those things in other ways, because men’s
spirits appeared to me not yet in a state
fit to comprehend such mysteries.”</p>

<p class="p1">The reader will not fail to notice
the portentous intimation conveyed
in the last sentence of this remarkable
record. Savonarola already
believed himself the recipient
of supernatural communications
“the knowledge which God gave
me of these things in other ways.”
We shall find him presently boldly
announcing his celestial visions and
commands from heaven, and here
may be discerned clearly and at once
the point at which his noble mind
and pure spirit, disturbed by the excitement
of years of mental tension
and meditation on Apocalyptic visions,
lost its clearness and its balance,
and fell into the gravest errors
of judgment and doctrine.</p>

<p class="pc1">THE FAMOUS SERMONS.</p>

<p class="p1">Crowds continued to press into
the church of S. Mark to hear the
preaching of Fra Girolamo, until the
utmost capacity of the building no
longer sufficed to hold them. For
the Lent of 1491, his preaching was
appointed to take place in the cathedral,
and the walls of Santa Maria del
Fiore for the first time echoed to his
voice. From this moment he was
lord of the pulpit and master of the
people, who, increasing every day in
number as hearers, redoubled in their
enthusiasm for him. The pictures
he drew charmed the fancy of the
multitude, and the threats of future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
punishments exercised a magic influence
upon all, for sinister forebodings
appeared to rule the hour. All this
was far from satisfactory or pleasing
to the Magnificent Lorenzo, and
naturally begat among his adherents
a feeling of strong opposition to Savonarola.
The result was that a
deputation of five of the principal
citizens (Domenico Bonsi, Guidantonio
Vespucci, Paulo Antonio Soderini,
Bernardo Rucallai, and Francesco
Valori) waited upon him, with
instructions to advise him that he
was risking his own safety and that
of his convent, and to admonish him
to be more moderate in his tone
when teaching or preaching. Savonarola
abruptly cut short their discourse,
saying: “I see that you come
not of your own motion, but that you
are sent by Lorenzo de’ Medici.
Tell him to make haste to repent of
his sins, for God is no respecter of
persons, and has no fear of the great
ones of this earth.” Proud of his independence
as a priest, Savonarola
desired thus to crush at the outset the
established custom in S. Mark of
continually bending and prostrating
before the house of Medici. At this
the deputation pointed out to him
the danger he was in of being exiled;
and he answered: “I have no fear
of exile from your city, which is,
after all, a mere grain of dust upon
the face of the earth. But although
I am only a stranger in it, and Lorenzo
a citizen and its head, know
ye that I shall remain, and ye shall
depart.”</p>

<p>To this he added a few words concerning
the actual condition of Florence,
which made them wonder at
the intimate knowledge he possessed
of its affairs. Shortly afterward in
the sacristy of S. Mark’s, in the presence
of several persons, he said that
the affairs of Italy would soon
change, for that the Pope, the King
of Naples, and Il Magnifico had not
long to live.</p>

<p>The ill-will of the Mediceans was
naturally strengthened by such an
incident as this. Their murmurs increased,
and, coming from a small
but influential portion of the citizens,
Savonarola took it into serious consideration
whether he should not give
up for the time the prophetic strain
of his sermons, and confine himself
to the inculcation of moral and religious
precepts. There is but little
doubt that he struggled earnestly and
conscientiously to bring himself to
this resolution, and he has himself
left the record of it in his <i>Compendio
di Rivelazione</i>. “I deliberated with
myself,” he says, “as to suppressing
the sermon on the visions I had
prepared for the following Sunday’s
cathedral service, and for the future
to abstain from them. God is my
witness that throughout the whole
of Saturday and during the entire
night I lay awake; and every other
way, every doctrine but that, was
taken from me. At daylight, fatigued
and exhausted by my long
vigil, while I prayed, I heard a voice
which said to me, ‘Fool, seest thou
not that God wills that thou shalt
persevere in thy path?’ And that
day, I preached a terrible sermon.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>It was, doubtless, as he says, “una
predica tremenda,” for, persuaded as
he was of his divine mission, he no
sooner entered the pulpit than, with
his imagination excited, his senses in
febrile agitation from the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
vigils and fastings, his subject carried
him away into bursts of denunciatory
eloquence that frightened while they
charmed his hearers. In his excitement
he again sees the nocturnal visions
of his cell, loses consciousness of
his own personality, and confounds
the words there heard with the language
of Scripture, for in his sermons
he frequently, in the rush of
language, cites as passages from the
Bible the phrases of his own visions.
Among these was his famous <i>Gladius
Domini super terram cito et velociter</i>.</p>

<p class="pc1">THE NEW PRIOR.</p>

<p class="p1">Meantime, in the interior of his
convent, the learning, the simplicity,
the profound piety and purity, and
benevolence of Fra Girolamo had
won for him the love and veneration
of all his brethren. At the election
of a new superior in 1491, they naturally
chose him for their prior.
Savonarola, who had always felt and
sought to inculcate the higher appreciation
of the dignity of the church
and its ministers, seized this occasion
to protest practically against a ceremony,
which to him seemed not only
compromising but degrading. Ever
since the reign of the Medici, it was
the custom for every newly elected
prior of S. Mark to render homage
and swear fealty to the reigning chief.
Savonarola gave no sign of conforming
to it, and from his silence might
have been supposed to be ignorant
of it. Some of the older monks reminded
him of it as a formality which
they had always considered obligatory.
This view of it was natural
enough from the fact that the Medici
really founded the convent and had
been its most generous benefactors.
The new prior’s reply was characteristic:
“Is it God or Lorenzo de’
Medici who has named me prior?
I acknowledge my election as from
God alone, and to him only will I
swear obedience.” This was carried
to Lorenzo, who said: “You see, a
stranger comes into my house, and
deigns not even to visit me.”</p>

<p>It must be conceded that, considering
his position and personal character,
Lorenzo acted with great
moderation, for he evidently desired
to conciliate the prior of the convent
and to avoid the scandal of a quarrel
with a religious. More than once he
attended Mass at S. Mark’s and
afterwards strolled in its garden.
On these occasions some brother
would run to the prior to tell him of
the distinguished personage who was
walking alone in the garden. “Did
he ask to see me?” was Savonarola’s
answer. “No, but ...”&mdash;“Then
let him walk there as long as he
pleases.”</p>

<p>The monk judged Lorenzo severely,
and acted in consequence, for he
knew all the injury to public morals
he had done, and looked upon him
not only as the enemy and destroyer
of liberty, but as the most serious
obstacle to any amelioration and
christianizing of the people. Failing
in one course, Lorenzo began to send
to the convent liberal alms and rich
gifts, but this only increased Savonarola’s
contempt for him, and he even
made scornful allusion to it in the
pulpit, intimating that such an
attempt only confirmed him in his
former resolution. Shortly afterward
were found in the “alms-box” of S.
Mark’s a number of pieces of gold.
The prior understood perfectly that
they came from Lorenzo, as in fact
they did, and, separating the princely
gold from the modest offerings of the
faithful, he sent it to the Buoni Uomini
of the city for distribution among
the poor, with the message that “silver
and copper sufficed for the wants of
the convent.”</p>

<p>Thus far thwarted at every turn,
Lorenzo was not the man to give up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
a struggle once entered upon, and he
was determined to turn, if possible,
the rising tide of the Dominican’s
popularity. The preacher most admired
at that period in Florence had
for some time been Padre Genazzano&mdash;the
same whose sermons were
attended by crowds when Fra Girolamo
could scarce retain a dozen or
two of people to listen to him. Lorenzo
requested the former to resume
his preaching. He did so, and his
sermon was announced for Ascension
Day. All Florence rushed to hear
him. Taking for his text, “Non est
vestrum nosse tempora vel momenta”&mdash;“It
is not for you to know the
times or seasons”&mdash;he imprudently
presumed too far upon his princely
patronage, and violently attacking
Savonarola by name, qualifying him
as a false and foolish prophet, a sower
of discord and scandals among
the people, so revolted his auditory
by his intemperate speech and uncharitable
denunciation that, in the
short hour of his discourse, he utterly
lost the reputation of long years’
acquisition. On the same day, Savonarola
preached upon the same
text, and, so far as the popular judgment
was concerned, remained master
of the field. Lorenzo, seeing the
total failure of his scheme, and suffering
from the rapid advances of a
malady that was soon to become
mortal, fatigued, moreover, with the
struggle against a man whom, in
spite of himself, he felt forced to respect,
he left him henceforth to preach
unmolested.</p>

<p class="pc1">SAVONAROLA’S SERMONS,</p>

<p class="pn1">as printed, give us, on reading them,
but a very imperfect idea of their
effect as delivered. Of that tremendous
power he wielded in the pulpit,
and concerning which the amplest
testimony of both his friends and
enemies entirely agree, the source
cannot be traced in the published
copies of his sermons. The earliest
of these are those preached in 1491,
on the first Epistle of S. John. It
would be a difficult task to present a
general idea of this collection. In
form, they offer no unity of subject
nor connection of parts, added to
which, the strong originality and
waywardness of Savonarola’s style
and studies make it difficult for a
modern reader to bring order out of
this apparent disorder. He always
commences with a citation from
Scripture, grouping around it all the
ideas theological, moral, and political
which it suggests to his mind, resting
these in their turn upon fresh
Biblical texts. The apparent result
to him who reads them to-day is a
heterogeneous mass of discordant
materials of which the confusion is
hopeless. But these sermons were
actually preached by Savonarola with
a very different result. To him everything
was clear. These words before
him in manuscript are but the dry
bones which he clothes with the
magnetic life of inspiration, and to
which he gives voice in the thunders
of his own eloquence. The fire of
his imagination kindles, figures of
gigantic power present themselves to
his mind, his gesture is animated, his
eyes flame, and, abandoning himself
to his originality, he becomes what
he really was&mdash;a great and powerful
orator. At times, he appears to fall
back into a mass of artificial ideas
without connection, again and again
to free himself by force of natural
talent, for, born orator as he was, he
needed the arts of oratory; and it
was only when his subject mastered
him, and carried him away, that nature
took the place of art, and he
was eloquent in spite of himself. Of
his originality and depth of thought
some idea may be gained from the
following extract taken from one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
his nineteen sermons upon the first
Epistle of S. John, in which he explains
at length the mysteries of
the Mass, giving in it religious precepts
and counsels to the people:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The word we utter proceeds out of
our mouths separated and divided by a
succession of syllables, in such manner
that, while one part exists, the other part
is already extinct, and, when the whole
word is pronounced, it exists no longer.
But the Verb, or the Divine Word, has no
divisions; it is one in its essence, it is
diffused throughout the created world,
and lives and endures throughout eternity
like the celestial light which is its
companion. Therefore it is the Word of
Life, and one with the Father. We accept,
it is true, this Word in various
senses. By ‘life’ we sometimes mean
the natural being of mankind, sometimes
we mean by it their occupation. Hence
we say, the life of this man is science,
the life of the bird is singing. But there
is but one true life which is in God, for in
him all things have their being. And
this is that blessed life which is the object
of man, and in which he may find infinite
and eternal happiness. Earthly
life is not only fallacious, but powerless
to give us happiness from its want of
unity in itself. If you love riches, you
must give up sensual pleasures; if you
are abandoned to these, you must renounce
the acquisition of knowledge;
and if you give up the acquisition of
knowledge you cannot obtain offices of
responsibility and honor. But the joys
of life eternal are all comprised in the vision
of God, which is supreme felicity.”</p>

<p class="pc1">DEATH OF LORENZO.</p>

<p class="p1">With a mortal disease fastened
upon him, Lorenzo the Magnificent
had retired to his villa at Careggi.
Hope of his recovery there was none,
for the physicians had exhausted
the last resources of their art. Even
the renowned Lazzaro da Ficino had
been called from Pavia, and had administered
his wonderful draught of
distilled gems without result. Death
approached rapidly, and in this
solemn hour Lorenzo’s mind turned
seriously on his religious duties. He
seemed entirely changed. When
Holy Communion was to be administered
to him, he made a superhuman
effort to rise from his bed, and,
supported in the arms of those around
him, to receive it kneeling, but the
priest, perceiving his weakness and
his agitation, insisted on his being returned
to his couch. It was impossible
to calm him. The past rose up
before him in horrible visions. As
he approached his end, his crimes
assumed gigantic proportions, and
became every moment more menacing,
filling him with a wild dismay,
and depriving him of the peace and
comfort he would otherwise have derived
from the consolations of religion.
Having lost all confidence in
men,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> he even doubted the sincerity
of his own confessor. Accustomed
to have his slightest wish obeyed, he
began to doubt if that ecclesiastic
had acted with entire freedom. His
remorse became harder and harder
to bear. “No one ever dared say
‘No’ to me,” he thought within himself,
and this reflection, once a source
of pride, now became his most cruel
punishment. Suddenly the image of
Savonarola in its grave severity
presented itself to his mind, and he
remembered that he at least had
never been influenced either by
threats or flatteries. “He is the only
true <i>frate</i> I know,” he exclaimed,
and expressed a desire to make his
confession to him. A messenger was
instantly sent to S. Mark’s for Savonarola,
who was so astonished at the
strange and unlooked-for summons
that it seemed to him incredible. He
gave answer that it appeared to him
useless to go to Careggi because his
words would not be well received by
Lorenzo. But when he was made
to understand the gravity of Lorenzo’s
condition, and the fact that he
had really sent for him, he set off
instantly. That day Lorenzo felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
himself rapidly sinking. Summoning
his son Piero, he gave him his last
instructions and his dying farewell.
He afterwards expressed a wish to
see Pico di Mirandola, who came
immediately, and the pleasure of his
society had a soothing effect upon
the moribund. Scarcely had Pico left,
when the prior of S. Mark was announced.
He advanced respectfully
to the bedside of the dying man.
Three sins in particular lay heavy
upon his conscience. These were:
the sack of Volterra; the plunder of
the treasure set apart for the dowry
of poor Florentine damsels, which
had driven many of them to evil
lives; the blood he had shed to revenge
the conspiracy of the Pazzi.</p>

<p>While speaking, Lorenzo’s agitation
increased alarmingly. But Savonarola,
in order to calm him, kept repeating,
“God is good, God is merciful.”</p>

<p>“But,” he added, when Lorenzo
had finished, “three things are necessary.”</p>

<p>“What are they, father?” asked
Lorenzo.</p>

<p>Savonarola’s countenance became
grave, and, reckoning upon his fingers,
he said: “First, you must have a firm
and lively faith in the infinite mercy
of God.”</p>

<p>“I have it fully.”</p>

<p>“Second, you must make restitution
of all money unjustly acquired,
or charge your son to do it for you.”</p>

<p>At this Lorenzo was sorely grieved
and perplexed, but with a great effort
he signified assent by nodding his
head.</p>

<p>Savonarola then rose, and, drawing
himself up to his full height, said with
solemn countenance and impressive
voice, “Lastly, you must restore to
the people of Florence their freedom.”
He fastened his eyes upon
those of Lorenzo, awaiting his answer.
The dying man, gathering what little
strength was left him, disdainfully
shrugged his shoulders without deigning
to utter a single word.</p>

<p>Thus&mdash;so runs the story&mdash;Savonarola
left him, and Lorenzo the Magnificent,
lacerated with remorse, soon
afterwards breathed his last sigh
(8th of April, 1492).<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The death of Lorenzo seriously
affected the public affairs of Tuscany
and of Italy. His personal influence
over other princes, his prudence and
ability, had made him in some sort
the moderator of Italian politics.
Piero, his son and successor, was in
every respect his opposite. Of handsome
and powerful physique, he abandoned
himself to athletic sports and
to gallantry. He possessed a certain
facility of improvisation and a pleasing
address, but centred his highest
ambition on horsemanship, tournaments,
and games of strength and
dexterity.</p>

<p>He inherited from his mother all
the pride of the house of Orsini, but
from his father none of that simplicity
and modesty of manner which
had so powerfully contributed to
render him popular. His manners
were rough and displeasing to all:
he yielded frequently to transports
of rage, and one day, in the presence
of many persons, gave his cousin a
violent blow with his fist. These
things were looked upon in Florence
as worse than an open violation of
the law, and of themselves sufficed
to create for him a great number of
enemies. Not only to his subjects
were his manners displeasing, but
from the very commencement of his
reign he so disgusted all the Italian
princes that Florence soon lost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
preeminence which Lorenzo had
gained for her. He utterly neglected
the public affairs, and was solicitous
only to concentrate in himself
all the power of the government.
Day by day he successively swept
away even the few remaining semblances
of liberty which Lorenzo had
taken great care to leave intact, and
to which the people naturally clung
with affection. General dissatisfaction
spread rapidly, and swept into a
threatening opposition even many of
the strongest partisans of the Medicean
dynasty. A certain uneasy expectation
of a change in public affairs
began to manifest itself, a change
the more necessary and desirable as
Piero, deserted by citizens of repute,
was forced to surround himself by
men either unknown or incapable.</p>

<p>Meantime the multitude pressed
around the pulpit of Savonarola, and
looked up to him as the preacher of
the anti-Mediceans. The fact that
Lorenzo, at the approach of death,
had desired him for a confessor,
gained him many adherents among
the admirers of that prince, who rapidly
fell away from Piero on account
of his personal faults and defective
administration. The populace, moreover,
recollected that Savonarola, in
the sacristy of S. Mark’s, had predicted
the approaching deaths of Lorenzo,
of the Pope, and of the King of
Naples. One portion of this prediction
had been verified, and the fulfilment
of another seemed close at
hand. The vital powers of Pope
Innocent VIII. were rapidly failing
him, and he died on the 25th of
April, 1492. The death of the King
of Naples, it was known, must soon
follow. And now all eyes were involuntarily
turned to the man who
had predicted the disasters which
seemed impending over Italy, and
whose prophecies seemed so strangely
fulfilled. The universal belief in
his prophecies seemed to confirm
Savonarola’s confidence in his own
power, and spread his name throughout
the world. He was at once the
cause and the victim of his own
visions. His exaltation increased.
The time he had foretold seemed
close at hand. He read and re-read
the books of prophecy, and preached
with greater fervor. It is but
little to be wondered at that in this
frame of mind his visions went on increasing
in number.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the same year,
while preaching the Advent sermons,
he had a dream which to him appeared
like a vision, and which he
did not hesitate to look upon as a
divine revelation. He seemed to
see in the heavens a hand holding a
sword on which was written: <i>Gladius
Domini super terram cito et velociter</i>.
He heard many voices, clear and
distinct, promising mercy to the
good, but menacing punishments to
the wicked, and crying out that the
wrath of God was nigh at hand.
Suddenly the sword points to the
earth, the sky is overcast, it rains
swords and arrows, the lightnings
flash, the thunders roll, and the
whole earth is given up a prey to
war, famine, and pestilence.</p>

<p>The vision ceased with a command
to Savonarola to menace the people
with approaching punishments, to inspire
them with the fear of God, and
induce them to beseech the Lord
to send good pastors to his church,
who would seek and save the souls
in danger of being lost. In later
years we find this vision represented
in an infinite number of engravings
and medals, and become, as it were,
a symbol of Savonarola and of his
doctrine.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c307" name="c307">UNITY.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">He</span> who holds not this unity of the
church, does he think that he holds
the faith? He who strives against
and resists the church, is he assured
that he is in the church? For the
blessed Apostle Paul teaches this
same thing, and manifests the sacrament
of unity, thus speaking: <i>There
is one Body and one Spirit, even as ye
are called in one Hope of your calling;
one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one
God</i>. This unity firmly should we
hold and maintain, especially we
bishops presiding in the church, in
order that we may approve the Episcopate
itself to be one and undivided.
Let no one deceive the brotherhood
by falsehood; no one corrupt the
truth of our faith by a faithless
treachery. The Episcopate is one;
it is a whole, in which each enjoys
full possession. The church is likewise
one, though she be spread
abroad, and multiplies with the increase
of her progeny; even as the
sun has rays many, yet one light;
and the tree boughs many, yet its
strength is one, seated in the deep-lodged
root; and as, when many
streams flow down from one source,
though a multiplicity of waters seems
to be diffused from the bountifulness
of the overflowing abundance, unity
is preserved in the source itself.
Part a ray of the sun from its orb, and
its unity forbids this division of light;
break a branch from the tree, once
broken it can bud no more; cut the
stream from its fountain, the remnant
will be dried up. Thus the church,
flooded with the light of the Lord,
puts forth her rays through the whole
world, with yet one light, which is
spread upon all places, while its
unity of body is not infringed. She
stretches forth her branches over the
universal earth in the riches of plenty,
and pours abroad her bountiful
and onward streams; yet is there
one Head, one Source, one Mother,
abundant in the results of her fruitfulness.&mdash;<i>S.
Cyprian.</i></p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c308" id="c308">THE TROWEL OR THE CROSS;</a></h2>

<p class="pc1">FROM THE GERMAN OF CONRAD VON BOLANDEN.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“<i>This is your hour, and the power of darkness.</i>”&mdash;S. Luke xxii. 53.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Bolanden’s</span> stories have been received with
such marked favor, both in the original and
translation, that we have thought a short biographical
sketch of the author would be acceptable
to the readers of The Catholic
World.</p>

<p>Joseph Edward Charles Bishoff, better known
as Conrad von Bolanden, was born August 9,
1828, at lower Gailbach, a village of the Palatinate,
formerly belonging to Lorraine.</p>

<p>His father was a wealthy merchant, and, when
his son had reached a suitable age, he placed
him under the direction of a private tutor; but
the child gave no indication of talent, and made
slow progress in his studies. He exhibited an
equally backward disposition in the Latin school
at Blieskastel, which he attended at the age of
eight years. When his parents afterwards
moved to Fischbach in Breisgau, it was his delight
to roam through the forests, and remain many
hours among the ruins of Hohenburg, situated
upon the summit of a high mountain. To his
close observation of the beauties of nature at
this early age we are doubtless indebted for the
graphic descriptions of natural scenery which
we find in his works.</p>

<p>Having studied Latin for some time with the
reverend pastor of Schönau, he entered, at the
age of thirteen years, the Bishop’s Seminary of
Speyer. Here also he was accounted a very dull
scholar, for the reason that the method of instruction
was unsuited to him, and because he
had already commenced to write poetry and romances.</p>

<p>In the year 1849, he became a student of the
University of Munich, and applied himself diligently
to the study of theology, for he felt within
himself the vocation to become a priest. During
this time, he wrote a <i>feuilleton</i> for the <i>Volkshalle</i>,
published at Cologne, in which he describes
an incident of the French Revolution.
On the 20th day of August, 1852, he was ordained
priest by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Nicholas von
Weiss, in the seminary-church of Speyer, and became
assistant priest of the cathedral. He devoted
himself with zeal and enthusiasm to his
new sphere of duty; but, at the end of two years,
the bodily strength of the young assistant was
completely exhausted, and he was made pastor
of Kirchheim Bolanden, a small city at the Donnersberg.
The parish numbered 1,303 souls, who
were distributed among not less than 40 stations,
in the midst of Protestants. Here again was a
hard and fatiguing field of labor, but the experience
which he acquired during his sojourn in
Bolanden concerning the nature of Protestantism,
was the foundation of his <i>Wedding-tour of
M. Luther</i>. In memory of this his first mission
as pastor, he called himself Conrad von Bolanden.</p>

<p>Ten months later, he was made pastor of
Boerrstadt. There he wrote, within three years,
<i>Eberhard of Falkenstein, or the Power of Faith</i>,
<i>Franz von Sickingen</i>, and <i>Queen Bertha</i>.</p>

<p>From the year 1859 to 1869, he was pastor of
Berghausen, about two miles from Speyer. Now
followed in rapid succession novels and historical
romances, which were at once translated
into all the living languages, and gave the author
a more than European fame, since his writings
were printed and read also in America. His social
romance, <i>The Progressionists</i>, lately reproduced
in this magazine, became very popular.
Workingmen of all classes made up funds to
buy the book. Among the higher class also,
and even in the family of a certain prince, this
work created a furor; but it was the cause of
great trouble to the author. A man of exalted
rank and power, whose scandalous habits were
known far and wide, imagined that he saw himself
depicted in <i>The Progressionists</i>. The wrath
of this person was the reason why many, out of
fear of incurring his displeasure, avoided the
presence of Bolanden. His shattered health, as
well as the loss of friends, induced him, in the
year 1869, to resign of his own accord his position
as pastor, especially as the compensation he
had received for his works had secured him an
independent fortune. He purchased for himself a
comfortable house in Speyer surrounded by a
large garden, and there he now lives, always
employed in writing, but in strict retirement.</p>

<p>His method of life is very regular. Every
morning at nine o’clock he appears in his garden,
where he occupies himself with his flowers and
fruit-trees, after which he reads the newspapers
and letters he has received. He never writes
either in the morning or late at night. He commences
work at two in the afternoon, and ceases
at five.</p>

<p>Having no sisters, brothers, or other near relatives,
Von Bolanden’s house is presided over by
his aged mother, Eleonore Languet, a venerable
matron, whose motherly love is never exhausted,
and whose devotion is repaid by the respectful
and childlike affection of her distinguished
son.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of Von Bolanden is his
decided aversion to travelling, and to stopping
at hotels. “I feel uneasy when out of my
house.” he often remarks. Like many literary
men, he is very absent-minded; he will look at
the clock to ascertain a day or date, and, during
the hottest days of summer, he will approach an
empty stove to light his cigar.</p>

<p>His great merits as a Catholic novelist, and
his fearless exposure of historical falsehoods, as
well as his efforts for the religious enlightenment
of the people, have been recognized by
Pope Pius IX., who has made him a Monsignore.
This distinction is important, inasmuch
as it implies the approval of Bolanden’s works
by the highest authority on earth.</p>

<p>God grant that the intrepid author may be
spared for many years to uphold the banner of
truth, and increase his merits by waging a combat
against the enemies of the Catholic Church.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="pc1">THE CONSPIRATORS OVERHEARD.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">A farmer</span> stood on the border of
a meadow, and, with hands clasped
upon the handle of his axe, looked
with disappointment at the appearance
of the grass. He shook his
head sadly, and exclaimed aloud:
“All labor and skill are useless if
God does not bless the land!”</p>

<p>He pushed his cap from his brow,
and the expression of his face became
more discontented than before, when
suddenly he raised his head, listened,
and gazed in the direction of the
forest. His whole aspect now changed;
his eyes lighted up with joy at
the sound of a beautiful tenor-voice
merrily singing:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“If I were only king,<br />
I would be just to all,” etc.</p>

<p class="pn1">A gentleman on horseback soon
became visible, followed at some distance
by a second rider, who was
evidently a servant. The gentleman,
who was young and handsome, was
dressed in gray; he wore his felt hat
jauntily on one side, thus leaving exposed
his good-humored, intelligent
countenance, and his dark and brilliant
eyes.</p>

<p>At the first curve of the road, he
checked his horse. A thriving village
is seen in the distance, and a
palace belonging to the king crowns
the summit of the hill.</p>

<p>“Franz, do you not think the
weather unusually pleasant to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your lordship.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the reason why
the atmosphere is so pure, Franz?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, your lordship.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you,” said the
young gentleman, taking off his hat,
and passing his right hand through
his curly hair. “The air is invigorating
and fresh because it is not
breathed by the ladies and gentlemen
of the court. I have often observed
that, whenever the caravans
from the city come out here, the air
becomes damp and oppressive. Nature
seems to shroud its loveliness in
a mourning-veil. Every shrub and
flower shrinks, as it were, within itself,
in the vain attempt to shut out the
idle babbling of courtiers and the
noxious smell of musk which they
use in such quantities. To-day,
however, the country is radiant in
beauty; peace dwells everywhere,
the most profound stillness reigns,
and the Spirit of God fills the heart,
therefore, Franz, I shall not return
yet; you can ride home alone.”</p>

<p>He sprang from his horse.</p>

<p>“Give me my portfolio and my
plaid!”</p>

<p>The servant handed him both.</p>

<p>Throwing the plaid over his shoulders,
the young count turned in the
direction of the woods, whose tall
beech-trees covered the sides of a
small hillock. The road ended in a
circle surrounded by young fir-trees.
Benches with comfortable backs invited
the traveller to rest; but the
count continued his walk until he
reached a certain spot, when he seated
himself upon a large moss-covered
stone. Through an opening in
the forest he saw the farmer, whose
whole deportment and walk again
expressed care and reflection.</p>

<p>“He also is a thinker,” said the
count to himself, “and the subject
of his meditation is doubtless more
profitable to mankind than are those
of many who make pretensions to
profound learning. As he stands
there, he is the very personification
of care! He is evidently devising
some plan by which the waters
of the little brook may be led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
into his parched meadows. Idle
work, my dear fellow! If you
should succeed in turning its fertilizing
streams into your land, and if
you should enrich the soil with the
sweat of your brow, the terrible military
ordinance will devour the fruits
of your labor. If you have sons
who are healthy and strong, they
cannot be of assistance to you, for
the army will claim their service.
The minister of war is insatiable in
his demands, and it is necessary that
he should be so, for we are living in
strange times.”</p>

<p>He continued to gaze musingly
upon the scene before him. Gradually
his countenance assumed an earnest
and almost solemn expression;
his bright eyes became dreamy, as if
communing with spirits of the invisible
world, until, as though yielding
to some mysterious impulse, he seized
his pencil, and began to write.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gruff voice was heard.
The poet is startled out of his dreams.
Four elegantly dressed gentlemen are
seen coming up the road, and approach
the circle.</p>

<p>“Who can escape his fate?” said
the young count angrily. “The
heavenly muses are put to flight by
hostile spirits; but what do I see?”
he continued, looking through the
branches at the group. “Three of the
most powerful men of the kingdom?
Three master-masons and the grandmaster
of all the Freemasons within
a circumference of three hundred
miles? What can bring these
sons of night to this peaceful spot?
I hope they will not remain long
enough to poison the fragrant air
with their foul plotting and plans.
Truly, their presence has already
effected a change: the sun does not
shine as brightly, and it is becoming
cloudy.”</p>

<p>He then sat listening.</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, professor,”
said the person with the
gruff voice. “To say the least, it is
a very singular fancy of yours to defend
the Jesuits.”</p>

<p>“No fancy at all, Herr Director;
it is simply the result of knowledge,”
replied the professor.</p>

<p>“The knowledge acquired in your
high-school is certainly wonderful,”
answered the director, with a mocking
laugh. “But your effort to defend
the Jesuits surpasses even the
bounds of knowledge!”</p>

<p>“If you scorn knowledge when
right and truth are in question, you
will surely allow a man of sound
judgment to have some respect for
that which is founded on facts,” said
the university professor, with great
warmth.</p>

<p>“Oh! you have my permission to
say what you choose between these
green walls,” exclaimed the director,
pointing with his hand towards the
young fir-trees.</p>

<p>“And you, most worshipful grandmaster&mdash;do
you also allow the free
expression of opinion?” inquired the
professor of a man with a gray beard,
whose eyes and features indicated a
disposition of great craftiness.</p>

<p>“Certainly; we are not in the masonic
lodge,” replied the gentleman
addressed. “I am not grandmaster
here, but a simple chief-magistrate,
Be careful, however, in your expressions,
we might be overheard.”</p>

<p>The professor walked around the
circle, and looked in every direction.</p>

<p>“There is no one within hearing
distance,” said he, returning.</p>

<p>“This is growing interesting; I
must take notes of what will transpire,”
said the invisible count; and
he at once commenced to write
down what he heard.</p>

<p>“Our order has determined upon
the extermination of the Jesuits&mdash;well!
As this resolution has been passed,
it no longer admits of debate,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the professor. “I do not speak
now as a Freemason, but as a close
observer of matters and things; and
what do I see? Attacks on all sides
upon the Jesuits. At Munich, our
Masons have clothed themselves in
the garment of Old Catholicity, that
they might hurl from the standpoint
of belief their anathemas against the
Jesuits. In Darmstadt, our first Masons
even went so far as to appear in
the garb of Luther, that they might
condemn the Jesuits from Protestant
pulpits also, and demand their expulsion
by actual force. All our
newspapers denounce the Jesuits,
and stir up a hatred of them among
the people. But, gentlemen, in my
estimation, the newspapers have gone
too far; any man of common sense
can convict them of falsehood and
calumny. Here is a Bavarian paper
of yesterday, called the <i>Kemptener
Gazette</i>,” said he, producing the journal.
“Listen to this article, which
endeavors to incite the fears of the
credulous.”</p>

<p>And the professor read:</p>

<p>“What are all the calamities which
threaten and even destroy the human
race in comparison to the crimes of
the Jesuits? For centuries they have
immolated thousands upon the scaffold,
and justified their acts by appealing
to an all-loving Deity. Children
and their parents, the young and the
old, virgins and matrons, have been
sacrificed to their cruel and insatiable
thirst for power. Amid, horrible torments
and unspeakable sufferings,
innumerable beings, despairing of the
mercy of God, have been put to death
at their command. They have been
the means of introducing treason and
parricide into the world; they have
artfully managed to incite with a
word one nation against the other;
while at the same time they point
with a hypocritical face to the cross,
the symbol of an all-governing
love. But what caps the climax
is that they seek to effect the ruin
of men, not for <i>time</i>, but for <i>eternity</i>.
With unheard-of cruelty, they everywhere
stifle spiritual freedom in its
very birth. They have secretly
murdered kings and emperors who
would not submit to their will. To
obtain their end, they destroy the
welfare of nations, and humble the
majesty of princes into the very dust.
Like an evil spirit, they have triumphantly
placed their yoke upon enslaved
mankind, and they yet strive to
carry out their base designs, as the
experience of our own times teaches
us&mdash;in a word, they are the enemies
with whom the spirit of truth has now
to combat.”</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, I ask of you,”
said the professor, holding up the
paper, “are not these accusations
most ridiculous and absurd? A
long chain of the gravest crimes and
of the most diabolical designs are
fastened upon the Society of Jesus,
and yet not a single one of these
allegations can be proved. They are
wicked and stupid fabrications, and
cannot but appear as such to a man
of ordinary intelligence.”</p>

<p>“To an intelligent man, perhaps!”
answered the director. “But the
article is not written for that class of
people, but only for the ignorant,
who are easily duped.”</p>

<p>“And we must remember,” said
one of the four Masons, “that the
article fulfils its end; it is even well
written; for it will fill the minds of the
common people with hatred and distrust
of the Jesuits if they read such
things of them.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly true, Herr Counsellor!”
said the director.</p>

<p>“The end, indeed, sanctifies the
means, we may say with truth,” replied
the professor. “Let us, however,
not forget that the present
attack upon the Jesuits will be recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
in history. A future age will judge
for itself, and I fear it will decide in
favor of a society which in our days
is assailed with such senseless fury.
Posterity will look upon the present
treatment of the Jesuits as not only
contemptible, but as cowardly and
wicked. According to the testimony
of centuries, the Society of Jesus is
the most active, the purest, the most
influential and learned order of the
Catholic Church. The Jesuits are
acknowledged to be the best teachers,
the most prudent instructors of youth,
the most experienced confessors, and
the most zealous priests. They are
known as the vanguard of Rome;
they are wonderful in mortification
and in obedience, and are always
ready to make any sacrifice whatever
for the church. I can prove this by
innumerable passages from Protestant
works.”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary, Herr Professor!”
interrupted the grandmaster.
“The Jesuits are no doubt excellent
people. The society is a masterly
organization; each member obeys
without contradiction the commands
of an experienced general; they form
the strongest bulwark of Rome; for
that very reason, they must be suppressed.
‘The Trowel or the Cross!’
that is to be the watchword! The
trowel, the symbol of Freemasonry,
must triumph over the cross, the
symbol of Christianity. According
to the spirit and plan of our order,
all religion must disappear from the
face of the earth. The trowel must
reign, the cross be broken. As the
Catholic Church gives the strongest
support to religious belief, and because
the Jesuits are the most active
propagators of the doctrine of Christ,
it is necessary that the Jesuits should
be exterminated.”</p>

<p>“Well, Herr Counsellor, I agree
with you,” replied the professor.
“The death-sentence has been pronounced
upon the Jesuits, and must
be executed; but, to accomplish such
a result, neither brutal force nor the
interference of the government should
be used; we should call knowledge
to aid us in gaining the victory.
There are perhaps two hundred Jesuits
in the whole German Empire; thus
there is one Jesuit to twenty learned
men. Now, I ask you, will it not be
disgraceful to our enlightened age
if twenty well-informed doctors cannot
render inefficient the activity of
one Jesuit? Will it not be a neverending
cause of shame to German
science if it cannot gain the mastery
over such a small number of unarmed
and persecuted men? It is humiliating
to my pride to use such means
for the extermination of this little
band of enemies. Science must be
made to destroy the Society of Jesus,
but not a decree issued in the spirit of
the barbarous and tyrannical Nero!”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me about your
sciences!” said the grandmaster
impatiently. “I am an old, experienced
Freemason, and you may believe
what I tell you. Science will
not be able to disconcert even one
Jesuit. Do not forget, dear professor,
that the Jesuits are proficient in
all the sciences, and that they understand
how to fight upon that ground.
We must not skirmish long with such
an enemy; we must advance quickly,
and must concentrate all our forces
for the great battle. It must now be
decided&mdash;the trowel or the cross!
If the dominion of the cross is to
cease, the religion of Jesus of Nazareth
must disappear; if the spirit of
Freemasonry is to obtain the victory,
then the Jesuits must first be exterminated
by every possible means.”</p>

<p>A deep murmur came from behind
a large tree in the vicinity. The
sound proceeded from the same
farmer, who, having walked around
his meadows, was on his return home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
when he heard voices in animated
conversation, and he lost no time in
hiding himself behind the tree. There
he stood, tall and broad-shouldered,
listening attentively; he would every
now and then clinch his strong fists,
and would dart fiery glances at the
assembled group of Freemasons.</p>

<p>“The most natural and efficacious
means,” remarked the professor,
“would be a decree of suppression,
which could be easily obtained from
the Chamber of Deputies, the majority
of whom belong actually or at
least in spirit to our order. But
the question is, Will the king consent
to it?”</p>

<p>“Bah! he is a narrow-minded man,
who does not govern, but is governed!”
said the grandmaster contemptuously.
“Our Masons have excited
his fears to such a pitch in regard to
the pretensions of the infallible Pope
that he is ready at any moment to
attack Rome.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” said the count to
himself, underlining the words in his
note-book: “A narrow-minded man,
who does not govern, but is governed!”</p>

<p>“Our victory is certain!” declared
the counsellor. “The time for a
decisive battle could not be more
favorable. The majority of intelligent
people and of the working classes
are without any religion. The lower
orders must be indoctrinated by our
Masons and apprentices; our newspapers
must confuse and alarm them
concerning the claims of the infallible
Pope. Besides, the German
emperor is a Freemason, the Crown-Prince
of Germany is a Freemason,
all the ministers of our country are
Freemasons, and many ministers of
other German countries are Freemasons.
In Spain, we are already so
powerful that the Grandmaster, Zorilla,
gave the royal crown to a prince of
his own choice. In Rome, for 1800
years the seat of the popes, the
“Grand-Orient” of our order will erect
his seat above the chair of an imprisoned
and helpless Pope. As I have
already remarked, affairs are everywhere
so propitious to our cause
that the trowel will surely conquer
the cross!”</p>

<p>“This is indeed your hour, and
the power of darkness!” thought the
count.</p>

<p>“Only hear the villains!” muttered
the farmer behind the hedge,
“What pious creatures these Freemasons
are!”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken in regard to
one point,” replied the professor.
“The Emperor and the Crown-Prince
of Germany are undoubtedly Freemasons;
but the real object of our
World Union is not known to either
of them. Neither William nor Fritz
dreams that after the downfall of the
altar follows that of the throne. The
cross is well adapted for the crown
of princes, but not the trowel. Suppose
the emperor shall discover the
fundamental law of our order? Do
you think that he would espouse the
cause of religion, and war against
us?”</p>

<p>“Care has been taken that he shall
never know it,” said the grandmaster.
“Do not torment yourself with
fears that will never be realized!”</p>

<p>“If the German emperor could
only hear these rascally Freemasons
talk!” thought the indignant farmer
within himself. “I must look closely
at these fellows.”</p>

<p>“Well, professor,” inquired the
grandmaster, “are you at last convinced
that the Jesuits must be first
driven out, and that this can only be
done by force?”</p>

<p>“I am not convinced of your last
assertion; but yet I submit, in obedience
to my oath as a Freemason
most worshipful grandmaster!” replied
the professor. “I shall endeavor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
in my sphere of labor, to be
restlessly active, so that we may
attain our great end. I shall do my
best to destroy religious faith in all
the young men confided to me, by
appealing always to the light of
science. Our universities of the
present day are justly considered to
be the most successful mothers of
religious unbelief. To the destruction
of altars, to the downfall of
thrones, to the universal fraternization
of all nations by means of a universal
republic without a God, without
heaven, without hell; for liberty in
our pleasures, for liberty of will, for
liberty in life and death, shall my
whole strength be dedicated in submission
to the rule of our order!”</p>

<p>The grandmaster nodded his
head approvingly. Suddenly the
group were startled by the appearance
of the farmer, who, no longer able to
control his wrath, stepped into the
circle. Holding his axe in his hand,
he gazed attentively at the strangers.</p>

<p>“What do you wish, good man?”
asked the grandmaster condescendingly.</p>

<p>“I have heard much about the
Freemasons, and, as I now have a
chance, I must look at them a little.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, this is fine work!”
replied the counsellor, concealing his
perplexity by a loud cough.</p>

<p>“How do you know that we are
Freemasons?” asked the director.</p>

<p>“I know it because I have been
listening to your confessions,” replied
the farmer.</p>

<p>The confusion now became general.</p>

<p>“What did you hear?” asked the
professor.</p>

<p>“I heard enough! But I must tell
you this, you Freemasons, your undertaking
will fail, for your motives
are wicked,” continued the farmer,
with rising indignation. “You say
that you will expel the Jesuits, and
destroy and exterminate them?
Slowly, gentlemen; the people also
will have something to say about
that. We Catholics know what the
Jesuits are. In the Bavarian Diet,
some one said that the skulls of the
Catholics should be beaten in. All
right; but I tell you, Freemasons,
that I will break with this my axe
the skull of the first one who dares
to come near our parish for the purpose
of driving away our dear, good
Jesuit father. Only try it! Do you
think,” he exclaimed, while he shook
his clenched fist at them, “that we
Catholics intend to be tormented by
vagabonds and good-for-nothing fellows
like you who do not believe in
a God, nor in a heaven, nor in a
hell? Do you imagine that we will
allow ourselves to be trampled under
foot, that we will permit our religion
to be destroyed, our faith undermined,
our priests abused and expelled?
Do you think that we are such
fools? Commence your work, and
you will see what will happen! We
are not African slaves: we are free
Germans; you Freemasons would do
well to keep out of the way. Our
fists are stronger than your trowels,
and defence, in case of necessity, is
lawful!”</p>

<p>The dignitaries of the most powerful
order in the world, observing the
wild looks of the angry man, were
silent.</p>

<p>“Do you see the cross upon the steeple
of the church there?” asked the
farmer, pointing to the village beyond.
“How many such spires are there not
in Germany? And you wish to take
down that cross from the church&mdash;the
cross upon which the Saviour
has died for us&mdash;and put on your
dirty mason-trowel? Ha! ha! that’s
too ridiculous!”</p>

<p>“Is your pastor a Jesuit, my
friend?” inquired the professor, in a
bland tone of voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; our pastor is a
Jesuit; he has been three years with
us, because there is a scarcity of
secular priests. And what a pastor
he makes! I can tell you, Freemasons,
that our Jesuit father is so good,
so zealous, so full of piety, that all
of you put together are not fit to unloosen
his shoes. Yes; you may
scowl at me, but it is so! And then,
gentlemen, I have something else to
say to you! If you think so much
about freedom, and about the welfare
of the people; if all your ministers
are Freemasons; and if you are
all-powerful in the chambers, why
do you heap burden after burden
upon the shoulders of the people?
Why is it that the taxes are growing
heavier every day? Why is it that the
farmers are pressed by the collectors
as if they were grapes? Why does
the war-budget constantly increase,
so that we are in danger of being
forced to work in the end only for
the soldiers? See, Freemasons, these
are our troubles; you can, if you
choose, help the oppressed people;
but I warn you to keep your hands
away from the Jesuits and from our
religion ... or ...” and he
made a threatening gesture, “you
will be sorry. Franz Keller, of
Weselheim, from yonder village, has
said it.”</p>

<p>He placed his axe upon his shoulder,
and walked away with long, determined
strides, while the Freemasons
preserved a deep silence.</p>

<p>The count laughed at their evident
discomfiture.</p>

<p>“Another significant proof of the
powerful influence of the Jesuits,” said
the grandmaster. “The parish of Weselheim
was formerly indifferent in regard
to religious matters; but now they
are made fanatical by having had a
Jesuit among them for three years.
He must leave!” continued he
angrily. “The clock of his activity
has run down.”</p>

<p>“Will the king receive us at his
villa?” asked the counsellor.</p>

<p>“On the 14th of this month, at
eleven o’clock precisely!” replied the
director.</p>

<p>“It is growing cold, gentlemen,
let us return,” remarked the grandmaster,
whereupon they all left the
forest.</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="pc1">A JESUIT AS A PASTOR.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> a meditative mood, the count
walked towards the village. The
serene and joyous expression of his
handsome face had disappeared, and
was replaced by a grave earnestness.</p>

<p>“A valuable experience!” said he
to himself. “So ‘The Trowel or the
Cross!’ is to be the watchword of
those who govern! Thrones are to
be broken over the ruins of the altars,
so that, in the end, a general fraternization
of mankind may, according to
the spirit of Freemasonry, crown the
whole. Fraternization&mdash;hem! The
real meaning of all this is that men
who are not rich and are not liberals
are to become the slaves of the liberals
and the rich. The farmer was
right: these Freemasons are wicked
rascals, for they do not believe in
God. And this spiritual rascality is,
without doubt, more wicked and dangerous
to the state than open drunkenness.
This farmer is a brave
fellow; I like him!” continued the
count, laughing. “Healthy in body
and spirit, courageous, sincere, and
free! Like a night-bird before the
eagle, so also do these light-hating
Freemasons shrink before righteous
and honest anger.” He sauntered
through the streets of the village, observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
with pleasure the universal
cleanliness that prevailed, and returned
politely the friendly salutations of
all who greeted him, after which he
entered his hotel. When he had dined,
and while reading the newspaper,
his servant appeared.</p>

<p>“Some men are here, your lordship,
who desire to speak with you.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p>“Good people from the country,
your lordship.”</p>

<p>“Send them up!”</p>

<p>Slowly, and bowing respectfully,
at least a dozen villagers entered the
room. The count at once recognized
the tall form and broad shoulders of
Franz Keller. The men were dressed
in their Sunday attire, and their
weather-beaten countenances were
full of care and solicitude.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, my
friends?” began the count, who saw
their embarrassment.</p>

<p>“We have come here on business,
your lordship,” said the leader of
the little troop. “I am the burgomaster
of this place, and these men
are the aldermen.”</p>

<p>“I am greatly rejoiced to make
the acquaintance of the principal men
of Weselheim,” replied the young
count kindly. “What is the nature
of your business with me?”</p>

<p>“I will tell your lordship. For
three years we have had a Jesuit
father as our pastor&mdash;a good, pious,
and zealous priest. The government
has, for the last four months, endeavored
to take him away from us, because
he is a foreigner. He has received
no less than three letters ordering
him to leave, but he will not
desert his post. He says that the
government did not make him pastor
of our church, but the bishop, and
therefore government cannot dismiss
him from the care of souls. But because
the Freemasons hate the Jesuits,
and because they are all-powerful
with the government, our pastor is to
be taken away from us by force. The
whole congregation are indignant at
this, for it will be difficult to find
another pastor like him. If the
gendarmes come, I do not pledge
myself that they will not be driven
out of the village; we all feel that
it would be a sin crying to heaven
if we allow a pious, innocent man to
be taken away by gendarmes like
a thief. No; we shall never submit
to such treatment! Now, this is our
humble request to your lordship:
to-morrow, or after to-morrow, our
most gracious king will arrive at the
palace yonder, and, since your lordship
is the friend of his majesty, the
entire parish beg of you to speak in
our behalf, so that we may be able to
keep our pastor.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, Herr Burgomaster,
and all the parish for the confidence
they place in me,” said the count.
“At the same time, I must confess that
it is a long time since I have heard
any praise of the Jesuits; the fashion
is now to heap insult upon them,
and to accuse them of every known
crime.”</p>

<p>“I ask pardon, your lordship,”
said Keller; “only those who do not
know the Jesuits will ever insult them.
We know them. Our Jesuit father
is a very pious man; he has no fault&mdash;or
at least one only.”</p>

<p>“Well, what fault has he?” inquired
Count von Scharfenstein.</p>

<p>“He gives away everything to
the poor, your honor,” replied the
burgomaster. “He keeps nothing
of what we give him; the lay brother
who lives with him carries it away
to others. A man must eat and
drink well if he expects to work well.”</p>

<p>“Very true!” said Von Scharfenstein,
hardly able to restrain a laugh.
“And because your pastor does not
eat and drink well, he therefore does
not work well either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! yes, your honor, oh! yes. I
did not mean to say that. What I
wanted to say was that our pastor
works very hard, but that he does not
eat enough, and therefore looks pale
and thin. We cannot make him
grow fat.” And the burgomaster
cast a satisfied glance at his own well
nourished body. “If we give him
the very best we have, he will not eat
it, but gives it away, and that provokes
us.”</p>

<p>“Console yourselves!” answered
Von Scharfenstein. “The poor to
whom your pastor gives the best he
has will not be displeased with him
for it. And for the very reason that
he is such an incorrigible friend of
the poor, I shall speak to the king in
his behalf.”</p>

<p>The interview now came to an end.</p>

<p>“God reward your honor!” said
each one of the delegation, as they
bowed and took their departure.</p>

<p>Von Scharfenstein, whose thoughts
were generally in the clouds, and who
paid very little attention to the course
of things in the world around him,
walked thoughtfully up and down his
room. The touching fidelity, love,
and reverence of the villagers for
their priest, at a time when authority
was mocked at unless supported by
brute force, excited in him great admiration.</p>

<p>“The hatred of Freemasons for
Jesuits is very natural,” said he.
“The grandmaster is right: it will
never be possible to plant the banner
of infidelity upon the ruins of the
altar as long as the bravest soldiers
of the church militant exist. This
forcible expulsion of the society is a
political blunder. The case merits
attention; I must take a look at the
theatre of action.”</p>

<p>He put on his overcoat and hat,
and went forth into the twilight.
Well-freighted wagons were returning
home from the fields. Those who
met saluted one another, or spoke a
few words together. Children carried
small bundles upon their heads,
grown persons dragged their burdens
after them. It was a scene of animated
activity. No swearing or
angry word was heard, but the day’s
work ended in the most peaceful
manner. The same thing was repeated
every evening during the sojourn
of the count in Weselheim, but,
having never felt any interest in rural
life, he was astonished at all that he
saw.</p>

<p>In the middle of the road, a heavily-laden
wagon came to a stand-still;
the horses refused to proceed, notwithstanding
the efforts of the driver.
The count could not but admire the
patience of a man who did not swear
at or ill-treat his horses. Several
peasants came to offer assistance.
They pushed the wheels, but in vain,
for the animals would not move.</p>

<p>“I do not know what is the matter
with the horses to-day,” exclaimed
the driver. “I have not overloaded
them.”</p>

<p>“Just a little too much, Jacob!”
said a voice.</p>

<p>At once all hats and caps are raised.
A tall, thin form now approached.</p>

<p>“May Jesus Christ be praised,
your reverence!” was the respectful
salutation of all the men.</p>

<p>“Now and for ever!” answered the
good priest. “Well, Prantner, what
has happened?”</p>

<p>“Your reverence, the horses will
not stir!”</p>

<p>“Because they want to rest a little,”
replied the Jesuit. “We do the
same when we are tired; and it is a
heavy, a very heavy load,” said he,
with a glance at the towering height
of the wagon.</p>

<p>“I have just told him that the
wagon was overloaded,” remarked
another peasant, in a tone of reproach.</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;but Prantner knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that his horses are very strong, and
he therefore has great confidence in
them,” said the pastor. “They are
splendid creatures,” patting the broad
necks of the horses, and stroking their
manes. The horses commenced to
snort, to toss their heads, and to paw
the ground. “Ah! see, they like
to be complimented,” he continued
cheerfully. “Let us always acknowledge
merit, and that which seems
difficult will then become easy.
Now, Prantner, go on!”</p>

<p>The priest had hardly stepped
back, when the horses proceeded on
their way without further urging.</p>

<p>“Was there ever any one like our
pastor?” exclaimed the peasants, in astonishment.
“He understands everything.”</p>

<p>“Where is he going, so late?”</p>

<p>“To Michael the carpenter, who
is dying, and who refuses to be reconciled
with his neighbor.”</p>

<p>“Michael has always been very
stubborn; may Almighty God grant
him a happy death!” Saying which,
the men dispersed.</p>

<p>The count, who had watched the
proceedings, also went his way.</p>

<p>“The leading spirit of this parish
is evidently the Jesuit, and he deserves
to be,” thought Von Scharfenstein.</p>

<p>The Angelus now rang; at once
every head was uncovered; for the
silvery tones of the bell reminded the
villagers of the incarnation of the
Son of God. From all the houses
resounded the angelic salutation,
sometimes uttered by the clear voices
of the children.</p>

<p>“What a pity that those men of the
trowel are not here to shake their
empty heads compassionately at the
pious usages of an ignorant but believing
people!” said the count.
“In my opinion, a people who are
reminded thrice during the day of the
incarnation of the Son of God, and
who are admonished to walk in the
presence of the Omniscient, are better
than a people who have no faith in
either the justice or the mercy of
God.”</p>

<p>Before the windows of a house
there stood several persons, principally
women. The count approached
out of curiosity, and looked into a
well-lighted room. The table near
the wall was covered with a white
cloth. Between two burning candles
stood a crucifix and a holy-water vase.
At the bedside of the dying man sat
the Jesuit father, making impressive
exhortations. He held the hand of
the sick man in his own, and would
frequently bend his head towards him,
as though expecting some reply. At
the foot of the bed knelt a young
man, who covered his face with both
hands. Two young girls and an aged
woman stood near with sad and depressed
countenances.</p>

<p>“What is the matter here?” inquired
the count, in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Alas! sir, it is a sad affair!” replied
one of the women. “Michael the
carpenter is dying, and the priest
cannot give him the last sacraments.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because Michael has for a long
time been at enmity with his neighbor.
For the last eight days, our pastor
has come several times a day to visit
him, in order to persuade him to be
reconciled; but Michael will not listen
to any advice. It is a pity for any
one to be so malicious and obstinate.”</p>

<p>At this moment, there was a movement
in the sick-room. The young
man who knelt at the foot of the bed
rose hastily, and left the house.</p>

<p>“At last, at last!” exclaimed a
voice, “Michael has again become
a Christian!”</p>

<p>A man was now seen to enter the
room; he was the carpenter’s neighbor.
The dying Michael held out his
emaciated hand to him, which the
neighbor took, although nearly blinded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
by tears. The Jesuit said a few
words, and the reconciled enemies
again shook hands. The women
standing near the window were loudly
sobbing. Von Scharfenstein was also
greatly moved by what he witnessed.</p>

<p>The priest left the house, and hurried
to the church.</p>

<p>“He will now bring the holy viaticum,”
said a voice.</p>

<p>“Thanks be to God!” said another.</p>

<p>The count returned slowly to the
hotel.</p>

<p>“I have until now examined only
superficially into the activity of the
Jesuit father, and must confess that
he works admirably&mdash;light and darkness
combat each other, it cannot
be otherwise. The Freemasons are
naturally the sworn enemies of an
order which fulfils its mission with
zeal and prudence. The trowel will
never attain an ascendency as long
as the cross is defended by such brave
soldiers, so well trained to combat!”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c319" name="c319">COUNTRY LIFE IN ENGLAND.</a></h2>

<p class="pc1">BY AN ENGLISH CATHOLIC.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> “intelligent foreigner,” that
convenient critic whom Englishmen
are so fond of using as a mouthpiece
for their own often just criticisms,
is supposed to have seen little or
nothing of England unless he has
visited the country mansions for
which our island is famous. And
this is very true, even if he have
been touring in the Lake country,
taking notes in the “Black
Country” around Wolverhampton,
inspecting cotton-mills in the North,
or admiring the gigantic human
engine called the “City” in London.
All these are phases of
English life, yet none is so distinctively
English as life in agricultural
neighborhoods. After all, social life
is the most visible test of difference
of nationality, and although the uniformity
of the XIXth century seems
to have fallen like snow upon the
world, covering its hedges and fields,
levelling its hillocks with its valleys,
and hiding alike its various flowers
and different weeds, yet here and
there some landmarks of the old
social systems still hold their heads
above this uninteresting pall of sameness.
The English are traditionally
tenacious of their individuality;
gracefully so at home, boastfully, and,
at times rather absurdly so, abroad.
But the indomitable “British tourist”
is too well known to claim much attention;
his personality is better expressed
by caricature than by sober
description.</p>

<p>Country life is often imitated
abroad, but the copy is at best but a
sorry caricature, for this institution
of social England cannot be transplanted,
as is evident by a very simple
reason. It has its roots in the
whole moral, political, and physical
system of the Saxon race; it comes
of mediæval and feudal feeling; it is
bound up with the territorial traditions
that hitherto have been England’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
bulwarks as much and more
than her navy, her insular position,
or her parliamentary institutions. It
is worth notice that in France the
beginning of the great Revolution
was the centralization of all social
interests in Paris and its court. Landed
proprietors envied the court office-holders;
they contrasted their “dull”
existence with the brilliant and meretricious
pageantry that framed the
lives of their luckier friends, and,
hurrying to join in the profitless triumphs
or even the disgraceful successes
of certain courtiers, they became
absentees, spent more than
their mortgaged and encumbered
lands would yield, had recourse to
money-lenders, lost all hold on the
sympathy of their tenants, and finally
incurred the hatred of some and
the contempt of all. The only
nobles who, during the Revolution,
could count on a guard of faithful
defenders and practical adherents,
were those of Brittany&mdash;the rugged
country gentlemen whose lives were
spent among the tenantry, and whose
knowledge of farming and hunting
made them the daily companions of
the class whom they headed. When
the storm burst, the peasants of La
Vendée alone were faithful to those
who had ever been faithful to them,
while the court favorites were betrayed
by the very servants whose
truculence they had mistaken for attachment.</p>

<p>This unfortunate system of neglect
never prevailed in England to the
same extent as it did in France,
though, during the brilliant reign of
Charles II., some poison of this kind
began to creep into the habits of the
landed gentry. Upon the whole, the
English lords of the soil have justly
and generously lived <i>for</i> as well as
<i>upon</i> their possessions, and, if we have
not had a “Reign of Terror,” this is
one of the chief reasons. The great
land-owners of a county (we speak
specifically of the midland counties)
divide among them the municipal
and political offices; the Lord-Lieutenant,
the High Sheriff, the M. P.,
the local magistrates, are all gentlemen
and property-holders, and personally
interested in the individual
progress of the county. Each
manor-house is a petty court of justice,
and offenders of a minor sort,
such as poachers, window-breakers,
and the like, are tried and sentenced
with exemplary despatch as well as
impartiality by the squires of the
neighborhood. There is generally a
yearly agricultural show, and as almost
all the gentlemen are cattle-breeders,
or keep studs for hunting or
racing purposes, and all the ladies
are more or less poultry-fanciers, the
whole community meets with equally
eager pleasure upon common ground.
The yeomanry and militia, which answer
to the rural national guard in
other European countries, are formed
of well-to-do young farmers whose
pride in their accoutrements or horses
is a healthy token of sound national
feeling; the officers are the gentlemen
of the county, the same who sit
upon the bench, and who entertain
their military tenants at the annual
rent-dinner. As for this gathering, it
has no ominous meaning for the
thriving men who attend it; the
meeting is signalized by an unlimited
flow of good spirits, of kindly feeling,
and, occasionally, of local and
rural wit. True, the speechifying is
at times prolix, and the number of
toasts alarmingly great; the smoke
of the farmers’ pipes becomes sometimes
rather dense, and the wit turns
to pleasantry which has a slightly
“heady” flavor like the wine, no
doubt; but, for all that, there is nothing
more reassuring in a political
point of view than such a gathering,
and nothing more charming to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
imaginative mind than this unfeigned
hospitality and baronial good-fellowship.</p>

<p>It might be said, speaking broadly,
that, “next to a gentleman, there
is nothing like a farmer.”</p>

<p>The farmer has his pride of caste
and descent as eminently as any
child of Saxon earls or of Norman
barons; his family have often lived
on the same land, under the same
roof, and owned the same allegiance
to a long uninterrupted line of noble
landlords for centuries back. Of nothing
is he prouder than of this, and
when, as is often the case, he entertains
the family of his lord, nothing
can be simpler, grander, and more utterly
gentleman-like than his conduct.
No straining after effect, but homely
and lavish abundance; no attempt
at fine speeches, but cordial and undisguised
rejoicing; respect that is
not the contrary to independence,
but the very assertion and expression
of it. In one estate, it happened,
perhaps about a hundred or more
years ago, that an Earl of G&mdash;&mdash;
wooed and married the pretty daughter
of one of his chief tenants; both
families are living now on the same
lands, and, when the farmer looks towards
the chancel of the parish
church from his capacious pew in
the nave, he sees the marble monument
of his beautiful ancestress, who
was twice the wife of a man distinguished
by noble birth, and generally
beloved for his goodness. (After the
death of her first husband, she married
his Cousin Tom, the great local
sportsman of his times.) Her portrait,
in her countess’ robes and ermine-lined
coronet, hangs conspicuously
in the dining-room of the family
mansion, while her two successive
husbands are represented not
far from her, the one in the gorgeous
court dress of a peer, the
other in the familiar green velvet
hunting-coat, with a fox-hound by
his side.</p>

<p>The farmers of the midland counties
are often land-owners on their
own account, and, far from being indifferent
or adverse to sport, they are
its chief encouragers. Fox-hunting
is an instinct with them&mdash;another likeness
they bear to their landlords.
You never hear a complaint of fields
ridden over, or crops injured; the
owner will gallop over his own furrows,
or break through his own
fences, utterly reckless of anything
but the pursuit of the fox. Meanness
is a thing unknown to them,
and yet you will hardly meet many
who are extravagant. There is a
broadness of character, an incapacity
for doing or thinking anything petty,
a love of Old-World customs and hereditary
modes of thought, that seem
to keep them out of the selfish narrowness
born of modern commerce,
and, while it makes them less sharp,
less peculating, makes them also incomparably
more lovable.</p>

<p>Surrounded by such people, of
whom they are the pets and the
pride, the children of the landlords
cannot fail to grow up healthy in mind
and body, full of fun and frankness,
loving country sports and pastimes,
learning early how to manage land
and crops, entering heartily into the
feelings and wishes of those they will
one day be called upon to rule, noting
the idiosyncrasies and carefully
handling the prejudices of their early
comrades and future co-laborers. A
bond of union, friendship, and help
is thus formed which grows stronger
every year, and stronger still with each
succeeding generation. The old men
and women, whose place is by the
capacious hearth, seem to live just
long enough to tell their master’s
grandchildren how they danced at
his “coming of age” fifty years ago,
while their own little grandchildren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
laugh as they think that, in a few
years more, there will be another
“coming of age,” and that they, too,
will dance at the old hall, and taste
the wonderful ale their father told
them of when they passed the ghostly
stairs leading down to the great
cellar.</p>

<p>Then come the weddings of the
daughters of the house, and, as they
have been familiarly known in the
village nearest their home by all the
poorer cottage tenants and the Sunday-school
children, the young brides
find the whole population personally
enthusiastic over each detail of the
ceremony. Young men and girls
have seen the ladies of the “house”
bringing cordials and delicacies to
their poor dying parents, and strewing
costly flowers over their plain
coffins in the churchyard; and they
remember this as the same fair girl
whom they saw minister to them in
their sorrow, takes upon herself
another and a lifelong ministry with
the hopeful trust of youth and the
holy certainty of love. Again, as
the bride comes forth, the children remember
the feasts in the grounds,
the armful of buns and cakes thrown
into their pinafores at leaving, the
delightful romps on the lawn, the adventurous
row round the pond which
their imagination magnified into a
stormy sea&mdash;all the pleasures, out-doors
and indoors, which were associated
with the sight and presence
of that slender, white-robed, and
white-crowned figure. Thus, while
there are class distinctions in rural
England, there are no class <i>divisions</i>,
and servants and masters, landlords
and tenants, form, as it were, one clan
with common interests and reciprocal
sympathies.</p>

<p>Then, life in the country is so much
more individual than in town. All
tastes are there easily gratified; books
and magazines are constantly pouring
down from London; guests, not
compulsory, as is the genus “morning
caller” in town, who lounges in utterly
exhausted, and asks languidly
whether “Lady So-and-so’s ball last
night was not perfectly delightful?”
while his general air of boredom proclaims
that he is surfeited with all
mundane <i>delights</i>&mdash;guests not such as
this inane specimen of humanity, but
chosen friends, gay, witty, brilliant,
are at hand at the shortest notice for
those whose life is cut out for society;
morning rambles for the solitary;
moonlight effects for the romantic;
hours of leisure for the studious; a
wide field of usefulness for the charitable;
a matchless opportunity for
indulging in the woman-gossip, without
which that essentially English
institution, five o’clock tea, would be
“flat, stale, and unprofitable”; and
last, not least, the best chances for
marriage that any sort of social intercourse
can afford.</p>

<p>The only drawback to this state of
things is that it sometimes becomes
a little too artificial. Even rusticity
may be aped, and, indeed, this is the
tendency of the day, as it was the
tendency in former days also, when
shepherdesses were represented by
ladies of fashion in silk skirts, beribboned
crooks, and high-heeled
shoes. But this pseudo-rusticity spoils
the real, tangible pleasures of life in
the country. Studied simplicity is
worse than studied art. Young ladies
“got up” like Dresden china
are not peasants, and have neither
the charms nor the merits of peasants.
They are probably <i>blasées</i>,
and so miss the freshness symbolized
by their costume; and they are incapable
of work, and so miss the usefulness
also distantly suggested by
their dress. In one expressive word,
they are a <i>sham</i>.</p>

<p>There are many houses, however,
where healthful pleasure is dominant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and no fine-ladyism finds favor&mdash;houses
where the chapel is not far
from the drawing-room, and where
masters and servants, guests and
hosts, meet silently to greet their
Maker before they enjoy his gifts for
the day. Then comes the ten
o’clock gathering round the breakfast
table&mdash;a picture in itself, with
bright flame-colored flowers amid the
delicate white glass and china, and
pretty faces joyously eager for the
day’s programme of amusements.
Perhaps there are ruins to be seen&mdash;a
great resource in country visiting&mdash;at
all events, there is a church. The
churches are certainly one of the
proudest inheritances of the old land,
and the way in which they have
been preserved speaks well for the
naturally reverential turn of the Saxon
mind. In every county, some
distinctive feature is visible; in Kent,
hardly anything is used in churches
but flint, and the bells are generally
hung in a square massive tower instead
of a steeple. In the midland
counties, on the contrary, steeples
are a great feature; there is one at a
little village called Ketton, which is
peculiarly fine, though it certainly
looks too heavy for the church it
crowns. Wicliffe’s church, at Lutterworth,
is a standard sight for the
guests of a large old family mansion
near by; you are shown the pulpit
said to be Wicliffe’s own, and, in one
of the aisles, his tomb, with a long
Latin epitaph sufficiently bombastic
and untruthful, as it states that, despite
of monks and bishops, he instructed
the populace in plain Gospel
truth, and was the first to translate
the Bible into the vernacular!
But Lutterworth church has for us
of the old faith a more interesting
memorial of the “good old days.”
This consists in a very primitive
fresco representing the resurrection
of the dead. The colors are not
much varied, and the draperies are
quaintly angular; yet this early effort
of art is far more simply and honestly
Christian than many of those skilful
productions of later periods, when
the painter thought more of the fame
his execution of a subject might
bring him than of the solemn truth
contained in the subject itself. Here
we see Our Lord seated on some very
solid-looking clouds, while below, on
the right side, the angels are helping
the good out of their sepulchres, and,
on the left, the devils doing the same
service to the wicked. Some of the
tombs are open, as if burst asunder
by an explosion, and the skeletons
stand bolt upright; some are half
closed, and their occupants creeping
quietly out; while in others the disjointed
bones are seen, not yet rebuilt
into human shape, or a skeleton
is detected half clothed with
flesh, and some bones still protruding
in their original bareness.
Much the same scene is portrayed
on the left side, but the expressions
even in the skeletons are very different;
the attitudes are distorted, and
the impish figures of the demons
prominently drawn. If there is a
lack of harmony and beauty in the
whole composition, it is quite compensated
for by the evident earnestness
of the artist, the gravity of the
angels’ demeanor, and the reverent
intention which animates the grotesque
<i>ensemble</i>. As an archæological
memorial, it is invaluable, as very
few such specimens of Catholic art
of so early a date (certainly no later
than the XIIIth century) are in existence
in England.</p>

<p>Some of the country churches are
beautifully restored according to old
Catholic models, and, with the restoration
of the ancient worship, might
again become what they were at the
time they were christened by those
suggestive names, All Hallows’, S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Mary’s, S. Chad’s. Others, however
are terribly neglected, though this is
a fault fast disappearing, together
with the fox-hunting, easy-going parsons
of the Georgian era, and all
other laxities of an unusually stagnant
age. The music in these country
churches is not always equal to
the imposing exterior, a harmonium
in the choir being sometimes all there
is wherewith to guide and sustain the
voices. Still, this is a step in the
right direction, as formerly the utmost
a village church could boast of
was an orchestra composed of the
local shoemaker with a dilapidated
fiddle and the smith with a bass-viol
out of tune. Any self-elected, occasional
amateur with a strong or a
thrilling voice would be, of course, a
welcome addition, but the instrumental
groundwork might be always depended
upon. Most churches near
family seats have remarkable monuments,
some of the ancient Elizabethan
style, with rows of decorous
sons and daughters praying in bas-relief
at the feet of their dead parents,
their quaint costume, heavy-folded
robes, and immense ruffles seeming
marvellously to suit the immobility
of the material in which they are
sculptured; some, again, dating back
to the times of the Crusaders, but
many, unfortunately, of the pseudo-Grecian
Renaissance, which to a Catholic
mind seem both irreverent and
absurd. Fancy a Cupid with eyes
bandaged and torch inverted as an
emblem of that sacred grief for the
dead which is inseparably mingled
with the steadfast hope of the Christian
for the day of resurrection!
Or again, as we once heard a sarcastic
friend aptly express it, a woman
crying over a tea-urn! Really, some
of these monuments are no better
than that, and deserve no other description.
How much more dignified
are those ancient Gothic tombs
where the quiet, stately figures of a
knight and his wife, a bishop, a magistrate,
lie as on a bed, in the sleep
of expectation, not in a ridiculous
simulation of life, nor symbolized by
some vulgar heathen myth.</p>

<p>A visit to the parish church is an
ordinary recreation on the first morning
of a guest’s stay at a country-house,
after which there will very
likely be croquet, that eminently
modern and English contrivance
which is pretty enough if one could
only make up one’s mind to consider
men and women nothing more than
grown-up children. A great deal
of care is often expended on the croquet
lawn, and ladies are even careful
in the choice of a croquet costume.
A lounge through the grounds, admiring
the host’s specimen trees&mdash;the
Wellingtonia is generally the chief
attraction&mdash;and sauntering through
the hot-houses, occupies the time till
luncheon. Most Englishmen have a
passion for rare trees and shrubs, and
often carry home from distant countries
seeds and cones for their
grounds at home. We have seen a
lovely Ravenna pine, grown from a
cone picked up in the celebrated
forest of Ravenna; every other shrub
of its kind perished from the effects
of the climate, while this solitary one
throve well, and filled a considerable
space in the garden. The copperbeech
is a very favorite specimen
tree in England, and looks beautiful
among the shaded greens of limes,
foreign oaks, and fir-trees. It is
generally the ladies of a household
to whose share fall the hot-houses
and the flower-garden, but in one
place in Cheshire, where the visitor is
unfailingly taken through miles of
glass, the whole thing is under the
special supervision of the master of the
house. Lord E&mdash;&mdash; of T&mdash;&mdash; is an old
man, and not very active, on account
of his impaired health; but, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
passionately fond of horticulture, he
spends half his day in his hot-houses.
The orchid-houses, particularly, are a
perfect marvel; there are eighteen
or twenty species of these lovely
flowers in bloom at all times of the
year, and the conservatory into
which some of these glass passages
lead is a palace of camellias, azalias,
and other rare and delicate flowers.
The garden and grounds are mostly
a wilderness of rhododendrons, of
which magnificent, far-spreading
bushes cover even the islets of the
artificial lakes. But the most beautiful
of Lord E&mdash;&mdash;’s floral possessions
is the fernery, where seven or eight
New Zealand arborescent ferns
spread their palmlike branches overhead,
hiding the glass roof above
them, and suggesting the earthly
paradise to the least impressionable
mind. The ground at their base is
covered with rock-work overgrown
with mosses and ferns of various
sorts, and water trickles hiddenly in
the tangle, its very sound denoting
coolness and repose.</p>

<p>In the autumn and winter, the men
of the party disappear after breakfast,
and return, tired with sport or laden
with game, about five o’clock; but in
summer, during the brief interval between
the London season and the
1st of September, the pleasures of
the ladies are shared with their
knights. A picnic is often the most
amusing resource for a day, and it
would be needless to describe it; but
what is not so common an occurrence
in the country is a breakfast,
that is, a two o’clock reception in the
open air, and a magnificent spread
of cold <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i> of the culinary
art. Let us suppose the <i>locale</i> to be
this: a pretty piece of water running
here and there into creeks fringed
with bulrushes and water-lilies,
and a queer little erection of no classifiable
style of architecture, neither
pavilion nor villa, but very convenient
and even sufficiently picturesque.
Clematis and honeysuckle climb
over its walls, and to the front is a
rather irregular lawn which is partly
carpeted for the occasion. In England,
we are never quite sure of not
getting our feet damp, and the flimsy
summer toilets appropriate to this
social festivity would be but a slender
protection against wet weather. All
the county, far and near, is asked&mdash;brides
just returned from their honeymoon
trip; old stay-at-home fogies,
childlike in the pleasure they exhibit
on this novel occasion; merry young
people bent on enjoying themselves
to the utmost. One old lady has
confidentially informed her best
friend about a wonderful new bonnet
she has bought on purpose, and
which turns out to be something
“fearfully and wonderfully made.”
It is curious to see the many different
kinds of vehicles that draw up at
the door of “Fort Henry.” Old
chaises driven by the most ancient
(and delightfully tyrannical) of family
coachmen; queer little low cars,
called by the complacent owner
“Norwegian cars,” drawn by a diminutive
pony resembling a Shetland;
hired flies from the country
town; open barouches of unimpeachable
make, but painfully, suggestive
of the “shop”; two-wheeled dog-carts,
the prettiest carriage for the
country, driven by young unmarried
land-owners whose arrival causes a
stir among the “merry maidens,”
as Sir Gawain called his pretty companions
in Tennyson’s <i>Holy Grail</i>;
lastly, a large “brake,” or capacious
car, filled with cross-seats, on which a
whole party from some neighboring
mansion is comfortably and amicably
packed; for not only are neighbors,
friends, and acquaintances asked, but
any visitors they may happen to
have staying with them. When all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
are gathered, the luncheon begins;
and certainly the table is a masterpiece
of floral decoration. The cook,
too, has surpassed himself, and the
rarest wines and fruits are lavishly
added to the more substantial hospitality.
The ladies’ dresses are a
<i>parterre</i> in themselves; the prettiest
things that taste can dictate are worn
for this <i>fête</i>, and the beautiful peacocks
that range the banks of the
lake must find themselves rivalled
for once in their own domain. How
different is this from a London
“breakfast”! Here we have no
simulated <i>ennui</i>, no cadaverous looks
resulting from sleepless nights and
constant dissipation, no hurry to get
away, no empty forms of hypocritical
civility. It is almost a family gathering.
After luncheon, the boats are
ready. Large and small&mdash;the largest
manned by four stalwart “keepers,”
hereditary retainers of the family&mdash;these
boats are quickly filled; and,
while the “state barge” (so to
speak) solemnly carries the elders
of the party around the pretty lake,
the smaller skiffs, rowed by amateur
oarsmen, and filled with a laughing
freight of girls, go off to try the
famous echo, or to sing glees near
the old bridge at the lower end.
This is not all the music, however;
a band is stationed in a boat that
follows the grand barge, or sometimes
stops to let the guests hear the
echo of a few loud notes sounded on
the horn. The effect of the music,
the echo, the gaily ringing laughter
of the younger guests as they row
swiftly from place to place, is like a
reminiscence of the days of Paul
Veronese and his pleasure-loving
Venetian companions. At one end
of the lake there is an old horse-chestnut,
whose branches stretch far
out over the water, and then droop
into it, forming a green vault over a
shady little nook. It is difficult to
steer a boat well in; therefore no
boat passes by without trying. At the
other end, the water is choked with
weeds and tall bulrushes, and the
plantation slopes to the brink, with
beautiful sunset lights playing on its
Scotch firs, and bringing out the blue
green of their foliage in peculiar
contrast with their dinted, reddish
stems; now and then a peacock’s
harsh cry is heard, or the water-fowl
take a swift, low rush over the surface
of the water, while the swans
move about as undisturbedly as if
the scene were to them an everyday
occurrence. Presently the sun sets;
the boats unload, and the carriages
begin to get ready again. A few
stragglers, probably the host’s own
visitors, who have not far to go home,
take a stroll up to the graceful bark
temple raised on the hillock opposite
the lake; the view is pretty from
there, and the whole thing looks like
an animated English water-color.</p>

<p>But this is not all the pleasure
that a country visit affords: a great
resource lies in <i>tableaux vivans</i>.
Very little trouble is necessary; in
some houses, a small stage is kept in
readiness, or can be extemporized
in an hour, just when the performance
is agreed upon. Pictures and poems
are laid under contribution; sometimes
a particular garment evidently
suggests such and such a use, and
a suitable tableau is got up to
exhibit it; and some costumes are so
very easy of arrangement that they
are naturally chosen. The “Huguenot
Lover,” by Millais, is a very
favorite scene, so is “Titian’s Daughter”;
and there are “Faith, Hope,
and Charity,” or other allegorical
figures, always at hand to fill up any
gap in the inventive genius of the
performers. But the best series we
can think of is one&mdash;not a little
ambitious&mdash;representing dramatically
the story embodied in Tennyson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
song, “Home they brought her Warrior
dead.” How often we have
listened to those words, so mournfully
sung! The first tableau is very rich
in details; the year-old bride, in the
gorgeous white and gold embroidered
robe which she had donned to
meet her husband, sits tearless and
pale in the centre, her dark hair escaping
from the jewelled fillet, her
white hands hard pressed together.
The body of her husband lies at her
feet covered with a dark cloak, his
pallid face just revealed, and the four
men who have borne him in stand in
sorrowful silence in the background,
while the attendant maidens press
round their mistress, each dressed in
some graceful, flowing costume. Any
amount of ornamentation, such as
tapestry, vases, porcelain, jewellery,
would be in keeping with the tableau
and enhance its beauty. The second
scene (the curtain being dropped for
a moment) is the same, with the addition
of a hoary old nurse placing
her child in the widowed mother’s
arms, while the bereaved one herself
turns on the babe a look of passionate
and agonized yearning. The child
is not a very easy part of the tableau
to manage, and it might, strictly
speaking, be left out; still, the story is
more completely told thus, and its representation
considerably improved.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the numerous
and variable pleasures to be enjoyed
by a large gathering of friends:
the winter brings others peculiar to
itself.</p>

<p>A <i>meet</i> is a very pretty sight, but
never more so than when it takes
place in front of an old manor where
the hunting-breakfast is going on.
This carries one back to the days
of our grandfathers, and gives to the
sport of fox-hunting a certain traditional
air of poetry. The servants,
whose livery is almost a costume in
itself, carry trays of substantial refreshments
and foaming tankards of
old ale among the farmers and professional
sportsmen, while the friends
and county neighbors of the host
circulate through the house, lighting
up our XIXth century dead-level of
dress by their scarlet, or, to speak
more technically, their pink coats.
This word is used to denote the color
the coat <i>ought</i> to have after a good
sporting season; for it is as inglorious
in a true sportsmen to wear a new
and undiscolored garment as it would
be for a soldier to bear an unharmed
standard or unbroken weapon out of
the battle. In many counties, the
full dress for dinner of those who are
known as sportsmen is a scarlet coat,
the rest of the dress being the ordinary
costume of our day; and very
gratifying it is to see the old custom
kept up by the gentlemen of the
midland counties, where fox-hunting
is in its glory. At the meet, not a few
ladies appear, some on horseback,
devoted followers of their brothers
and husbands in the chase, some in
carriages, with their little children
prettily dressed in red, or otherwise
suggestively clad. The host’s wife
or daughters come out among the
hounds, perhaps in the graceful
riding-habit, or more often in jaunty
little cloth suits, with red feathers
coquettishly peeping out of a sealskin
cap. The hounds are all collected
in front of the hall-steps, and answer
whenever called by name by the
huntsmen. At last the cavalcade is
off, and winds past the margin of the
park and grounds, till the sound of the
horn and the crack of the whip die
away in the distance, to be heard
again a few hours later, when the
whole field, after making a circuit of,
say, ten miles, returns to some
cover near the house, where the unhappy
fox is caught at last. Boys
follow the hounds as soon as they can
ride, and, indeed, sometimes perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
feats that make them heroes in a
small way in the eyes of their companions.
A few years ago, the
youngest son of the chief land-owner
of the Cotswold Hills in Gloucestershire,
distinguished himself in this
way, and, upon a tiny gray pony, Asperne
by name, kept so close to the
huntsmen that he was always first in
at the death, and many a time was
the first to break a gap through a
hedge or a stone wall, through which
the whole field would follow him.
He often brought home “the brush”
(a fox’s tail), and the sportsmen from
the opposite side of the county used
to ride ten or twelve miles to the
next meet to see the wonderful boy
whose exploits and reckless daring
were in every one’s mouth.</p>

<p>The early autumn, before the fox-hunting
has regularly begun, brings
its own pleasures with it, one of
which is a nutting expedition. This
generally involves a tea-picnic&mdash;a far
more amusing affair than the conventional
mid-day meal known by that
name, and devoted to the consumption
of sandwiches, cold meat, salad,
and soda-water. This tea-picnic has
often occupied a pleasant afternoon
within our own recollection, especially
when a very informal party of
young foreign guests was gathered at
E&mdash;&mdash; House. There was a representative
of Germany, a young man high
in office at the former Hanoverian
court, who bore a remarkable likeness
to Prince Albert, and to whom
the queen even spoke of this, to her,
touching fact. Very fresh and childlike
was this young Prince S&mdash;&mdash;, and
very different from certain of his
English contemporaries, who, at
eighteen, declare that life is a <i>bore</i>,
and amusement a sham. These are
the men who discredit our century,
and belie nature herself. They affect
to have no faith in woman and no
hope in religion. We have known
one of these when he first began to
go into society. He was fresh and
charming, said the most innocent,
boyish things in a fearless, truthful
way that was especially winning. He
excelled in all social pursuits, and rejoiced
in all healthy amusements.
Add to this that he was uncommonly
good-looking, with dark hair and
eyes such as are not often met with
in England, and was an only son,
heir to a fine Northern property, part
of the family house dating as far
back as the XIIth century. We met
him two seasons later, and he was
hardly recognizable. The same
handsome features, but with a wearied,
listless air marring them; in his voice
no animation, in his manner not a
trace of that early frankness that was
his greatest charm. He used to
seem like a girl of seventeen; now
he was, morally speaking, a misanthrope
of five and thirty! He owned
himself that all amusements, even
dancing (which was a special accomplishment
of his), <i>bored</i> him, and that
there was nothing but pigeon-shooting
that excited him! Even during
the famous matches at Hurlingham
(a villa near London where the
pigeon-shooting is done, and which
has become of late one of the most
<i>recherché</i> haunts of fashionable idlers,
and a field for the display of the
loveliest toilets), this young victim
of <i>ennui</i> hardly vouchsafed to seem
interested; yet beneath all this was
a soul worthy of great things; a will
that, guided aright, might achieve
much good to society or even to the
country; and a personality eminently
fitted for moral and intellectual success.
And this energy was being
thus wasted by day, while, according
to his own confession, billiards occupied
the greater part of his nights!
Poor England, indeed, when her manliness
is thus thrown away! Who
would not look back with pride and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
regret to the days of the “good old
English gentleman,” with his boisterous
and rough pursuits, his fox-hunting
and his farming, but, withal, his
healthful vitality and his active usefulness?</p>

<p>Besides the young German, so
pleasant a contrast to the <i>blasé</i> youth
of London drawing-rooms, there was
round the gypsy kettle in the woods of
E&mdash;&mdash; a Spaniard as good-natured as
he was stately; and, strange to say,
here was another royal likeness!
Many might have mistaken him for
the Prince of Wales. Other Spaniards,
too, there were, more lively and not
less good-natured, one with a smile
that was irresistibly comic, the other
with the profile of a S. Ignatius, and
principles and habits that well suited
his appearance. The English girls
of the party were well matched with
their companions, and looked very
picturesque as they toasted immense
slices of bread at the end of forked
sticks at least a yard and a half long!
The tawny golden hair of one, the
willow-like figure and gravely childish
glee of another, the restless activity
of a third, as they all joined in
the search for dry fire-wood, made a
pretty subject for an artist; and, in the
midst of the bustle, the father, enjoying
the young people’s fun, gave a
touch of pathos that much enhanced
the beauty of the rustic scene.</p>

<p>A drive home through the tall
bracken, and along the grassy roads
of the numerous plantations, perhaps
a rapid visit to deserted “Fort
Henry,” and a row to the Echo, sufficed
to fill up the evening, and a
project for paying a visit to an old
Quaker tenant on the morrow would
perhaps be discussed during dinner.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that foreigners
grow enthusiastic over this side of
English life; the pity is that so many
rush to England and leave it again
before they have a chance of seeing
a family gathering in the country;
those who have not seen it know
little more of English society than
we do of the fruits of the West
Indies after we have tasted them in
the shape of candied peel and preserved
jellies. Drawing-room life is
the same in Paris, St. Petersburg, or
New York; individualism thrives only
in the country, and it is there the
character of a nation should be
studied.</p>

<p class="pc1">FROM THE FRENCH OF CHARLES DUBOIS.</p>

<h3 class="p1">CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class="pc1">EUGENIE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">A week</span> after, Louis came to see
us for the first time.</p>

<p>“Well,” inquired Victor, “do you
like your new manner of life?”</p>

<p>“Yes and no, my dear friend,” replied
Louis. “Yes, because I feel
that the new life on which I have
entered is good for me. It is just
what I needed, I must confess&mdash;for I
think aloud here. It is such a relief
to speak to some one who understands,
who loves you, and is always
ready to excuse and pardon you!
But I forewarn you I need, and shall
need, great indulgence, though nothing
ought to seem too hard to one
who was on the high-road to destruction,
soul and body, and would
at this very instant be lost, had not
God, in his mercy, sent you to my
aid. This benefit has filled me, I
assure you, with so much gratitude
from the first that, in view of my
past life and the divine goodness, I
feel I ought to be a saint in order to
expiate so many transgressions&mdash;I
ought to prove my sincerity by some
heroic sacrifice for God.”</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! that is somewhat ambitious.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is absurd. Not that
it is necessarily absurd to aspire to
heroism, but the means should be
taken into consideration. Now, mine
are fearfully, pitifully inadequate. I
am cowardly, fickle, and a lover of
my ease.”</p>

<p>“Come, come! do not calumniate
yourself. We must neither judge
ourselves with too much leniency
nor with too much severity. We
must see ourselves as we are. This
is difficult, but it is essential.”</p>

<p>“Well, my kind friend, that is exactly
the way I regard myself.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it.”</p>

<p>“You shall judge for yourself.
My duties oblige me to remain night
and day at St. M&mdash;&mdash;. Alas! this
very necessity I find harder than I
can express. There is not a day in
which I do not find myself regretting
the city three or four times. This is
very wrong, when the city has been
so pernicious to me....”</p>

<p>“Come, you exaggerate things.
You were born and brought up in
the city, and have always lived here
till now. I see nothing astonishing
at your finding it disagreeable at first
to live in the country.”</p>

<p>“What a lenient judge! We shall
see if you are as much so after the
other acknowledgments I have to
make. There are times when work
seems insupportable. To rise at six
o’clock and superintend workmen
and machinery the live-long day
irritates and fatigues me to such a
degree that I am sometimes tempted
to give it all up.”</p>

<p>“You have not yet yielded to the
temptation?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; that would be too
despicable.”</p>

<p>“Since you yourself regard such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
step as it deserves, pursue your occupation
without being concerned
about a slight disinclination for work.
Even people who have always been
accustomed to labor have such temptations.
I assure you, in a year
there will be no question of all this.
You will have acquired a love for
your business, and, active as you are,
you will not be able to do without
it.”</p>

<p>“You think me at the end of my
confession. The worst is to come.
Mr. Smithson is polite and sincere,
but reserved and ceremonious, like
all Englishmen. He keeps me at a
distance, and appears as if my errors
and loss of property, which of course
he is aware of, gave him some superiority
over me. I think he does
wrong to make me feel this.”</p>

<p>“Ah! this is more serious, my
dear friend. Like all people in a
wrong position, you are inclined to
be unduly sensitive. Watch over
yourself. Endeavor to be guided by
reason. I do not wish you to submit
to too much haughtiness, but do
not attribute to people airs, and especially
intentions, they are not guilty
of.”</p>

<p>“You are a thousand times right.
I appreciate your advice, and promise
to follow it. It would, indeed, be
foolish to make myself needlessly unhappy.
St. M&mdash;&mdash;, as you know, is
a lovely place. The river on which
the mill stands has many charming
views. During my leisure hours, I
can draw and paint at my ease. I
have a great deal to do, and my
work is frequently burdensome, but I
shall become accustomed to it, for it
is a source of real interest. By an
excess of good luck, I have lodgings
that suit me in apartments near Mr.
Smithson’s house. There I can read,
meditate, and pray at my leisure.
One thing only is wanting&mdash;a little
society in the evening; but that will
come, perhaps. I am invited to dine
at Mr. Smithson’s next Thursday.
I hope that will be the commencement
of closer intercourse with the
family. Hitherto, I repeat, they
have kept me at a distance. I have
exchanged a few words with Mme.
Smithson, who appears very affable,
but I have only had a glimpse of the
daughter&mdash;Eugénie, I believe her
name is. As far as I could judge,
she is tall, fine-looking, even dignified
in her appearance, with something
haughty in her air. I frankly
confess it will be a treat to meet these
three people. I have always had a
fancy for studying different characters,
and shall enjoy it particularly
now, I am so unoccupied in the
evening.”</p>

<p>“And your workmen&mdash;what do
you make of them?”</p>

<p>“I am constantly observing them,
and assure you they are as interesting
to study as any one else. What
a source of reflection! We have,
you must know, workmen of every
grade, good and bad&mdash;yes, fearfully
bad. There are four hundred and
fifty people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;who
represent every phase of
humanity.”</p>

<p>“To study mankind, my dear
friend, to confine one’s self to that,
is an amusement suitable for a philosopher.
But a Christian has higher
views: he studies human nature in
order to be useful.”</p>

<p>“That idea has occurred to me.
I have even formed a series of fine
projects; but I am so poor a Christian,
and so inexperienced!”</p>

<p>“No false modesty! Excuse my
bluntness; but false modesty is the
shield of the indolent, or their couch,
whichever you please. Have you
any desire to benefit the people
among whom you live?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly, if I can.”</p>

<p>“You can. You only need zeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
and prudence; the one ought always
to guide the other. Come, what
plans have occurred to you?”</p>

<p>“I should like to found an evening-school,
and take charge of it.
Those who are the best instructed
might serve as monitors.”</p>

<p>“Perfect! That would be a means
of keeping the young men, and even
those of riper years, from idleness
and the wine-shops, and afford you
an opportunity of giving them good
advice. What else?”</p>

<p>“I should also like to establish a
fund of mutual aid.”</p>

<p>“Excellent!... Reflect on
these two projects till Sunday. I
will do the same. Consult Mr.
Smithson also about them, and come
and dine with us in a week. We
will talk it over, and you can tell me
how you like the family you are
about to become acquainted with. I
hope you will be pleased with them.”</p>

<p>“I hope so too, but have my
fears. If they were all like Mme.
Smithson, everything would be propitious.
I took a fancy to her from
the first. But Mr. Smithson is frigid,
and his daughter seems equally unapproachable.
It is singular, but I
had met her once or twice before
I entered her father’s employ. I
thought her beautiful and intelligent,
and heard her very highly spoken of.
But really, I begin to believe that she,
like many others, is brilliant rather
than solid.”</p>

<p>“Come, come! no rash judgments!”</p>

<p>“What can I say? I was deceived
in her. I thought her an uncommon
woman&mdash;one capable of comprehending
all the delicacy of my position,
and of coming to my assistance.
She ought to realize that I am out of
my element there. You must confess
that Mlle. Smithson’s coolness does
not tend to console me.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear friend, you are
very exacting!... Would you
expect as much from every one?”</p>

<p>“No; but this young lady occupies
an important place in the house,
without trying, I confess, to take advantage
of it.”</p>

<p>“And an important place in
your thoughts ...,” said Victor,
with the friendly, significant smile so
natural to him.</p>

<p>Louis blushed.</p>

<p>“I am inclined to think your opinion
of her will be less severe in a
week. I, too, have heard her highly
spoken of.”</p>

<p>These words seemed to afford
Louis great satisfaction. Victor did
not continue the subject.</p>

<p>If you have carefully followed the
conversation I have just related, you
must see that Louis, though unaware
of his sister’s hopes, already thought
more of Mlle. Eugénie than he confessed
or even acknowledged to himself.
I think I shall only anticipate
your wishes in making you acquainted
at once with that young lady,
who is to fill an important <i>rôle</i> in my
story. And this cannot be done
better than in her own home.</p>

<p>Eugénie is in her chamber. It is
the morning of the day Louis and
some other acquaintances are to dine
with her father. She is engaged
in completing her toilet. A more
charming room cannot be imagined.
It is furnished in exquisite style.
Nothing is lacking. The pictures
are all rare, and arranged with artistic
taste. The book-case contains, not
so many books, but solid works that
will bear reading over and over
again. What, above all, completes
the charm of this young girl’s bower
is the view to be seen from the two
windows, which are like frames to a
picture. They afford a glimpse of a
terrestrial paradise through which
flow the limpid waters of a deep
stream. A breeze, playing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the poplars that stand on its banks,
softly rustles the leaves. Directly
across, on the opposite shore, is a
broad meadow, bright with flowers,
with here and there clumps of trees.
As far as the eye can reach are objects
on every side to satisfy the soul,
and excite it to reverie: a windmill
with its long wings of white canvas
swaying in the air; a villa with its
gardens; a little hamlet, and, overlooking
it, a church, the slated belfry
of which is glistening in the sun.</p>

<p>The world is full of material souls
whom it would be a kind of profanation
to introduce into a place so attractive.
They would be unable to
appreciate the charm. What is nature,
however beautiful, to a man
eaten up with avarice and ambition?&mdash;to
a woman who only dreams of
pleasure?... To such degenerate
souls, nature is a sealed book&mdash;a
divine picture before a sightless
eye.</p>

<p>But to this number Eugénie did
not belong. The daughter of a Catholic
mother and a Protestant father,
she had been educated in one of the
best schools in Paris. Shall I call
her pious? No; that would be exaggerating.
Eugénie did not lack
faith. Her religious instincts were
well developed, but checked by her
father’s coldness and her mother’s
frivolity. She was by no means insensible
to all the beautiful and true
in religion. They filled her with admiration.
She always fulfilled the
obligations rigorously imposed by the
church, but avoided going any farther
through indifference as well as
calculation. She had a horror of
what she called petty religion and
little practices of piety. Poor girl!
she, too, closed her eyes in this respect
to the light. The practices she
disdained&mdash;frequent prayers, the
raising of the soul to God, visits to
the church, and assiduous frequentation
of the sacraments&mdash;are they not
what truly constitute religion, such
as it ought to be, in order to be the
companion, friend, and guide of the
whole life?... This is what
Eugénie did not comprehend, or rather,
what she did not wish to comprehend.
In short, she was religious
in her own way&mdash;half-way religious&mdash;quite
so in theory, but in reality
much less so than she should have
been.</p>

<p>The somewhat indirect influence
her parents exercised over her in a
religious point of view also affected
her in other ways. Eugénie possessed
two natures: she was cold like her
father, and kind like her mother, but
without displaying it. Let us also
add another characteristic by way of
completing her portrait&mdash;she was romantic.
In everything, she had a
repugnance to what she called commonplace.
An object, an individual,
or an action, to please her, must have
a peculiar stamp, an original turn,
which she wished might be more frequently
met with. She only liked
what was out of the common course,
according to the elevated standard
of a certain ideal she had formed in
her own mind.</p>

<p>Eugénie’s exterior, her distinguished
manners, her fluency in conversation,
and the tone of her calm, well-modulated
voice, all inspired a respect
bordering on admiration. She was
beautiful without being bewitching.
She was kind, but in so inexpressive
a way as to inspire at first fear rather
than confidence. As has been said,
she possessed a character not easily
read, and, though only twenty-one
years old, she passed for what is
called, and with reason, a person of
ability. Her father and mother doted
on her: she was their only child.
Yet there was a difference in their
affection. Mr. Smithson tenderly loved
her as a daughter: Mme. Smithson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
loved her with a shade of fear, as we
love a companion or friend whose
superiority we feel.</p>

<p>Her toilet otherwise completed,
Eugénie rang for her waiting-maid
to arrange her hair. Fanny did not
keep her waiting. There was a striking
contrast between mistress and
maid. Fanny was towards forty
years of age. She was of ordinary
height, neat in person, but plain and
unattractive in appearance. She had
a bad complexion, large eyes hidden
under thick lashes, a wide mouth, and
a large fleshy nose, which made up
one of those vulgar faces that are
never observed except to laugh at.
She was beloved by no one except
her employers. This was not strange.
She had an observing eye and a
keen, sarcastic tongue. Her nature
was soured, rather than instinctively
bad. She was selfish and bitter&mdash;a
good deal so. This selfishness and
bitterness sprang from two causes
which she would by no means have
acknowledged. She was no longer
young, she knew she was homely,
and she had no hope of being married.
Such a hope she had once, and
a few days of happiness was the result.
Fanny would have been so glad to
be, in her turn, mistress over her own
house! But her dream had vanished,
and under circumstances not calculated
to sweeten her temper.</p>

<p>For some years, Fanny was a servant
at Mme. Smithson’s sister’s.
That lady was in the commercial line
at Paris. There Fanny made the
conquest of a smart young man from
the country employed by her mistress
as head clerk. He was an excellent
person, but, like many others, wished
to reconcile his affections with his
interests. He said to himself that,
by waiting awhile, he might, some
fine day, find a wife richer, prettier,
and younger than Fanny. As he
was bound to her by no actual promise,
he finally obtained another situation,
and disappeared without any
warning. The poor girl regarded
such conduct as infamous. She felt
that all hope of ever marrying was
now lost, and the disappointment
made her ill. Unbeknown to her,
her mistress had followed all the
scenes of this little domestic drama.
She nursed Fanny with a care that
was quite motherly. When the girl
recovered, she expressed her gratitude,
but begged permission to go
away. The house had too many
cruel associations. Her mistress willingly
consented, and Fanny entered
Mme. Smithson’s service. When the
latter left Paris, Fanny accompanied
her to St. M&mdash;&mdash;, and had now been
in the family several years.</p>

<p>Having, to her great regret, no
prospect of marrying, forced to acknowledge
to herself that she should
never have a house of her own to
manage, Fanny had but one desire,
but this was an ardent one&mdash;to be
installed in a family which, if not her
own, might prove as pleasant, and
where she could rule while appearing
to obey. But where find this ideal
home?... She resolved to create it.
And in this way: her old mistress,
Mme. Smithson’s sister, had a son
named Albert, who was five years
older than Eugénie. Fanny had
known him from his childhood. She
was attached to him, and, above all,
she understood his disposition. No
one knew better than she that Albert
would be the easiest, the most
manageable, in short, the mildest of
masters. On the other hand, she
knew that Eugénie, energetic as she
was, would not be difficult to please.
“Mademoiselle lives in the clouds,”
she said to herself; “she will be
glad enough to have some one manage
the house for her.”</p>

<p>Fanny, therefore, resolved to
make a match between the two cousins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
There is reason to believe she
made skilful overtures to her former
mistress and to the young man himself,
and that these overtures were
well received. Albert was now preparing
his thesis with a view to the
law. As he was not rich, his cousin’s
fortune was a very pleasant
prospect, and still more so to his
mother. Besides, Albert had always
known Eugénie and loved her, as is
natural to love a cousin that is
pretty and intelligent. He and his
mother, therefore, made Fanny their
intermediary, without committing
themselves to too great an extent.</p>

<p>But Fanny had a good deal to
overcome. Mr. Smithson was not
partial to lawyers. The profession
was not, in his estimation, clearly
enough defined or very elevated.
As to Eugénie, no one knew what
her sentiments were with regard to
her cousin. Fanny thought she had,
if not a very strong attachment to
him, at least an incipient affection.
But she was not sure. Thence resulted
continual fears. Every young
man who entered the house was to
her an object of alarm. Perhaps her
prospects, so slowly ripening and so
dear, would be again overthrown by
this one!</p>

<p>It may be imagined that Fanny
looked with an unfavorable eye on
Louis’ connection with the manufactory.
If Mr. Smithson had chosen
another kind of a man to aid him,
one who was obscure, a mere common
man of business, she would not
have minded it. But in the course
of a week, she was fully informed as
to the history of the new-comer.
She knew he belonged to one of the
best families of the city; that he had
been rich, and might become so
again; that, till recently, he had been
regarded as one of the most brilliant
young men in society; and he was intelligent,
well-educated, and of irreproachable
morals. “I am lost!”
thought she. “All these people are
linked together to ruin my plans.
This M. Louis comes here as an engineer?...
Nonsense! it is an
arrangement between his father and
Mr. Smithson. They wish him to
marry mademoiselle. What a contrivance!
And that poor Albert,
what will become of him?...”</p>

<p>These suspicions quite upset her.
She resolved to make inquiries, in
order to relieve her mind, if by
chance she was mistaken. But
whom should she question?... Mr.
Smithson?... That must not be
thought of. Eugénie? Fanny
made the attempt. Eugénie, with
her usual coolness and wit, replied in
such a way that Fanny retreated
every time more uncertain than before.</p>

<p>The day of which I am speaking&mdash;the
notable day of the dinner&mdash;Fanny,
out of patience, could endure
it no longer. She resolved to carry
matters so far that, whether she liked
it or not, her mistress would be forced
to revive her hopes, or utterly destroy
them. Hardly had she entered
the chamber before she opened fire:</p>

<p>“How shall I arrange mademoiselle’s
hair?”</p>

<p>“As usual.”</p>

<p>“Then we will dress it differently
this afternoon with ribbons and flowers.”</p>

<p>“Why such a display?”</p>

<p>“Can mademoiselle have forgotten
it is the day of the great dinner?”</p>

<p>“Great dinner? What do you
mean by such nonsense, Fanny?
Why, whom are we to have at our
table of so much importance? Nobody
is invited that I have not
known a long time: our neighbor,
M. Daumier, with his wife and
daughter, Dr. Ollivier, and M. Dupaigne.
Really, it would be singular
for me to receive them with any
ceremony.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mademoiselle has not named all
the guests.”</p>

<p>“Whom have I forgotten?”</p>

<p>“M. Louis Beauvais.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is true. I overlooked
him. But his coming will not
change my intention to remain as I
am.”</p>

<p>These words were uttered in a
tone of perfect indifference. Fanny
was overjoyed, but careful not to
manifest it. Then, as she continued
to busy herself about her mistress,
she began to reflect. “She does not
care for him,” she said to herself.
“There is nothing to fear for the
moment, then. But who knows how
it may be by-and-by?... I must at
once find out if, under favorable circumstances,
she might not conceive
an affection for him, and try to prevent
such a misfortune. I will take
the other side to find out the truth.”</p>

<p>“A charming young man, this M.
Louis, and quite worthy of interest,”
said she, without appearing to attach
any importance to her words.</p>

<p>“What do you find so charming
in him?”</p>

<p>“He has a serious air, which I
like.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it might even be called
gloomy.”</p>

<p>“He may well have.”</p>

<p>“Really! Ah! Fanny, then you
know his history?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mademoiselle; and a very
curious one it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, relate it to me. Only suppress
the details; you always give
too many.”</p>

<p>“Three months ago, M. Louis was
the finest dancer and the gayest
young man in the city. Unfortunately,
these young men are not always
remarkable for uniformity. He
lived like a prince for six years, and
one fine morning found himself penniless.”</p>

<p>“And what did he do then?”</p>

<p>“They say&mdash;I am unwilling to believe
it, but everybody says so&mdash;that
he tried to drown himself.”</p>

<p>“A weak brain. That is not to
his credit.”</p>

<p>“They also say that M. Barnier,
the journalist, saved him at the risk
of his life, and converted him so
thoroughly that the poor fellow
came near entering a monastery.”</p>

<p>“A queer idea! That shows he
has more imagination than reason!”</p>

<p>“But he did not stick to his first
intention. He is now established
here, and will remain, I feel sure, ...
and this alarms me!...”</p>

<p>“Why are you so sure? And how
can this assurance cause you any
alarm?”</p>

<p>“That is a secret. Mademoiselle
will excuse me from replying.
Though I have known mademoiselle
from her childhood, she intimidates
me.”</p>

<p>“Not much, Fanny.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, mademoiselle,
I do not understand you.”</p>

<p>“You understand me perfectly, but
I have to dot your i’s for you. Well,
I will do so. I do not intimidate you
much, I say. You dare not tell me
what you mean, but you give me a
hint of it. What are you afraid of?
Tell me. I insist upon it.”</p>

<p>“As mademoiselle insists upon it,
I feel obliged to tell her what she
wishes to know. Mademoiselle is
not to be resisted. But I should prefer
keeping it to myself. If it were
to displease mademoiselle ...”</p>

<p>“No; go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, mademoiselle, I have
everything to fear! This young man
has lost his property.... He passes
himself off here as a creditable person....
He has secret designs ...”</p>

<p>“What designs?”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle puts me in an awkward
position.... It is such a delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
point to speak to mademoiselle
about.”</p>

<p>“That M. Beauvais aspires to my
hand through interested motives?”</p>

<p>“I should not have dared say
so.”</p>

<p>“Well, that would be audacious!
I accept a man for a husband whom
poverty, disgraceful poverty, alone
inclines towards me!”</p>

<p>“Without doubt, he has committed
many faults, but there is mercy for
the greatest sinner, and he is so pious
just now!”</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;he goes to church often,
even during the week. That is his
own affair. That is enough, Fanny.
Let there be no further question of
this between us. You take too much
interest in what concerns me, as I
have told you before. I am astonished
you should force me to repeat it.”</p>

<p>Fanny, thus dismissed, went away
furious and more uneasy than ever.
But if she could have read Eugénie’s
inmost thoughts, her fury would have
turned to joy. As soon as she was
gone, Eugénie seated herself in a low
arm-chair, and began, as she sometimes
laughingly said, to put her
thoughts in order.</p>

<p>“That malicious girl is no fool,”
she said to herself. “This young
man may have entered my father’s
service from secret motives, perhaps
suggested by his family. Who knows
but my parents themselves smile on
his projects? My father seems to be
on the best of terms with his father.
Perhaps they have come to an understanding
with a mere word, or even
without speaking at all. That would
be too much! Well, if it is so, if
the whole world conspires against
me, I will defeat their calculations....
In the first place, I do not fancy
this M. Louis, and I will soon let
him see it, as well as those who favor
him. The mere supposition that I
could ever be his wife makes me indignant
and angry. I marry a man
who has ruined himself, who only
aimed at my fortune, and would
squander it in a few years! I give
my heart to a man who does not love
me, and, even if he sincerely vowed
he loved me, would be in such a position
that I should always have reason
to doubt it! And, besides, what
a weak mind this hare-brained fellow
must have to play so many <i>rôles</i> one
after the other! I wish my husband
to have purer motives and a stronger
head. This man must have a false
heart. He is an intriguer, and that
includes everything....”</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class="pc1">MORE ABOUT EUGENIE&mdash;A REAL FRIEND.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">That</span> evening, Louis found himself
for the first time in the midst of the
Smithson family. We often thought
of him that night, and wished we
could know at once what kind of a
reception he had met with, especially
from Eugénie. But we were obliged
to wait for these interesting details
till Louis could relate them himself.
We did not have to wait long. When
he came, he was gloomy and dispirited.
Victor pretended not to observe
his dejection.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “you have now
made the acquaintance of the Smithsons.
What do you think of them?”</p>

<p>“A good many things, but I can
sum up my impressions in a word:
they are queer people!”</p>

<p>“Indeed! did they hurt your feelings
in any way?”</p>

<p>“Yes; ... yet I do wrong to
be angry, or even to be astonished.
I should have expected it.”</p>

<p>“This great dinner, then, did not
turn out as I hoped&mdash;a means of cementing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
amicable, if not affectionate,
relations between you?”</p>

<p>“By no means.”</p>

<p>“You greatly astonish me!”</p>

<p>“It is just so.... The way
things were managed shows the
Smithsons to be sagacious people.
They invited me, in order to make
me understand at once the position
I hold in their estimation&mdash;that of
engineer and superintendent, nothing
more.”</p>

<p>“I am really amazed!”</p>

<p>“And I am equally so. I did not
expect it, but the fact is too evident.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell me all that happened,
without omitting anything.”</p>

<p>“Not to omit anything would
make the story long, and it is not
worth the trouble. I will briefly relate
what I think will interest you,
that you may have an idea of this
first visit. There were but four other
guests, whom I only regarded with
indifference. They were neither
pleasing nor displeasing, so it is useless
to speak of them. We will confine
ourselves to the leading members
of the household. I will first speak
of the real though unacknowledged
head. My mind is made up on this
point. As I saw from the first, it is
Mlle. Eugénie who rules the house.”</p>

<p>“Even her father?”</p>

<p>“Yes; even her father; not as
openly and directly as she does her
mother, but as unmistakably by dint
of management.”</p>

<p>“Is she really a superior woman,
as I have been told, or is she merely
shrewd and imperious?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no. Those who have
sounded her praises have not deceived
you. She is by no means a common
person. In the first place, it
must be confessed she is really handsome.
There is especially a rare intelligence
and dignity in her appearance.
She converses well, often says
something profound, and is always
interesting. She is a lover of the
arts, and all she says, all she does,
evinces an elevated mind.”</p>

<p>“Such a person as is seldom met
with, then&mdash;a model of perfection?”</p>

<p>“She has all that is necessary to
become so, ... and yet she is
not. One fault spoils everything,
one or two at the most, but they are
serious. She is proud or egotistical,
perhaps both.”</p>

<p>“Are you not too severe upon her?
You scarcely know her, and yet you
are very decided in your condemnation.”</p>

<p>“I have reasons for my opinion.
You shall judge for yourself. My
position with respect to Mr. Smithson
is very trying. He knows, and
doubtless the rest of the family too,
all the follies I have committed within
a few years, and how I regret
them. He cannot be ignorant, nor
they either, that the office I hold under
him, however respectable, must
awaken a susceptibility that is natural
and excusable, even if exaggerated.
In this state of things, I had a right
to expect that Mr. Smithson and his
family, if they were really people of
any soul or breeding, would treat me
with a delicacy that, without compromising
them, would put me at
my ease.”</p>

<p>“I am of your opinion. And have
they been wanting therein?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and in a very disagreeable
way. It is little things that betray
shades of feeling, and it was thereby
I was hurt. In leaving the <i>salon</i> for
the dining-room, each guest offered
his arm to a lady. Mr. Smithson,
his daughter, and myself were the
last. Mlle. Eugénie took her father’s
arm with an eagerness that was
really uncivil.”</p>

<p>“It was from timidity, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“She timid?... I must
undeceive you! She certainly is not
bold, but she is far from being timid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
At table, I found myself consigned to
the lowest place. None of the guests
were great talkers, and more than
once I took part in the conversation.
Mlle. Smithson undisguisedly pretended
not to listen to me. She even
interrupted me by speaking of something
quite foreign to what I was
saying.”</p>

<p>“Her education has been defective.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, she is perfectly well-bred.
To see her an hour would
convince you of this. When she is
deficient in politeness, it is because
she wishes to be.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, but cannot comprehend
it all.”</p>

<p>“I have not told you everything.
The worst is to come. Towards the
end of dinner, the conversation fell on
a certain cousin of Mlle. Eugénie’s.
His name, I think, is Albert. She
praised him highly, to which I have
nothing to say; but she added&mdash;and
this was very unreasonable or very
malicious&mdash;that this dear cousin did
not imitate the young men of fashion,
who were extravagant in their expenditures,
acquired nothing, and
ended by falling into pitiful embarrassment.
I was, I confess, provoked
and angry. I felt strongly tempted
to make Mlle. Smithson feel the
rudeness and unkindness of her remark.
But I bethought myself that
I was a Christian, and that, after all,
the most genuine proof of repentance
is humility. Therefore I restrained
my feelings, and remained silent.
The rest of the evening I cut a sorry
figure. Mlle. Smithson seemed perfectly
unconcerned as to what I
might think.”</p>

<p>“Her behavior is so inexplicable,”
said Victor, “that, if I had these
details from any one else, I should
refuse to believe them.”</p>

<p>(At this part of her story, Mme.
Agnes made a remark it may be well
to repeat to the reader: “You must
bear in mind,” said she, “that
neither Victor nor I then had any
means of knowing what I related a
few moments ago as to Fanny’s projects
and Eugénie’s suspicions; and
we were completely ignorant of her
turn of mind and romantic notions.”)</p>

<p>“Well,” resumed Louis, “her way
of acting, at which you are astonished,
does not amaze me. I can easily
explain it. Mlle. Eugénie imagines
that I aspire to her hand, or rather,
to her fortune. She is mistaken;
I aspire to neither. I acknowledge
she has a combination of qualities
calculated to please me, but her disdain
excites my indignation. I mean,
therefore, to put a speedy end to her
injurious suspicions. Then I will
leave the place. I have already begun
to put my project into execution.”</p>

<p>“Do not be precipitate, I beg of
you. It is a delicate matter. What
steps have you taken?”</p>

<p>“None of any importance. This
morning, the work-rooms being closed
as usual on Sunday, I went, before
Mass, to sketch a delightful view not
a hundred steps from the manufactory.
I was wholly absorbed in my
work, when Mlle. Smithson approached.
I will not deny I was moved at
seeing her.”</p>

<p>“Then you are no longer indifferent
to her?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I think I can vouch for the
perfect indifference of my sentiments
for the moment. But would this
coldness towards her always last if
I did not watch over my heart?...
She has so many captivating qualities!
I have seen so few women to
be compared to her! No, no; I will
not allow myself to be captivated
unawares; that would be too great a
misfortune for me.... I have resolved
to raise myself in her estimation.
I will clearly convince her she has
calumniated me in her heart; that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
am in no respect the man she thinks;
and, when I have done that, I shall
leave. So, when she approached, I
bowed to her with respect and politeness.</p>

<p>“‘You are sketching, monsieur?’
she said, bending down to look at my
work. ‘It is charming.’</p>

<p>“‘It ought to be, mademoiselle.
There could not be a landscape better
calculated to inspire an artist.
But while I am admiring what is before
me, I regret my unskilfulness in
depicting it. It is my own fault. I
have so long neglected the art of
drawing. I have acted like so many
other young men, and lost some of
the best years of my life.’</p>

<p>“She understood the allusion&mdash;perhaps
too direct&mdash;to her sally of the
other day. A slight blush rose to her
face. ‘One would not suspect it,
monsieur,’ she said. ‘But as for
that, even if you have lost your skill,
it can easily be regained in the midst
of the delightful views in this vicinity.’</p>

<p>“‘It is true, mademoiselle! A lovelier
region it would be difficult to
find. I wish some of these views for
my sketch-book, as I may leave any
day.’</p>

<p>“I uttered these words in a cool,
deliberate tone, and then resumed my
work. Mlle. Eugénie seemed to
wish to continue the conversation,
but, slightly abashed, had not the
courage, I think, to make any advances.
I bowed ceremoniously, and
she went away. My opinion is, she
stopped out of mere curiosity. She
had shown how little she esteemed
me, and was not afraid of my attaching
any importance to her speaking
to me. Such a course favors my
plans.”</p>

<p>“Wonderfully! But&mdash;nothing headlong!
Forbear leaving Mr. Smithson
too precipitately. You are now
near your family. Time may show
things to you in a different light.
And, above all, it seems to me great
good can be done there, and more
easily than in most places. Tell me
something of your workmen. Have
you thought of the two projects we
talked about the other day? Have
you spoken to Mr. Smithson about
them?”</p>

<p>“No; it seems to me they would
not particularly please him. I really
do not know whether this Englishman
has any heart or not. I am inclined
to regard him as an egotist,
merely employing men to increase
his wealth, and not very solicitous
about their welfare.”</p>

<p>“I must undeceive you. I have
reason to think Mr. Smithson a very
different person from what you suppose.
We have not many Protestants
here, you know, but still there are a
few. Among them are some who
are really actuated by good motives.
They assembled a few months ago at
the house of Mr. Carrand, the rich
lawyer you are acquainted with.
They wished to establish a charitable
society, in imitation of our Conferences
of S. Vincent de Paul, but did
not succeed in their plans. To effect
such an enterprise, there must be the
zeal and charity that animate the
Catholic Church. To her alone God
grants the sublime privilege of devoting
herself with constancy and
success to the physical and moral
welfare of mankind. Though their
project remained unfruitful, it revealed
a generosity much to the credit
of the Protestants interested in it
Mr. Smithson himself was one of the
foremost on this occasion to manifest
how earnestly he had at heart the
welfare of the poor; and this without
any evidence of being influenced
by selfish motives.”</p>

<p>“What you say surprises me, but
it gives me great pleasure. I shall
henceforth be less reserved with
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you will do well. I even
advise you to consult Mme. and
Mlle. Smithson about your charitable
plans. They are Catholics, and
will comprehend you at once.”</p>

<p>“I have no great confidence in
their piety.”</p>

<p>“My dear friend, I regard you
with the affection of a brother....”</p>

<p>“Say, rather, of a father, as you
are, in one sense, having saved my
life; and also by another title, in
aiding me to become an earnest
Christian, such as I once was.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, let us use a medium
term. My regard for you shall be
that of an elder brother. I thank
you for allowing me this title. My
affection for you makes me take an
interest in all that concerns you. I
have obtained very exact information
respecting the Smithson ladies from
a reliable source. They are not as
pious as they might be, but they do
not lack faith, and they fulfil the absolute
requirements of the church.
I know that Mlle. Eugénie is keenly
alive to the poetical side of religion.
You have, I believe, an important
<i>rôle</i> to fill in the family and in
the whole establishment. You can
do good to every one there, and,
at the same time, to yourself. The
course to be pursued seems to me
very simple. I feel sure Mlle. Smithson
has some misconception concerning
you&mdash;some injurious suspicions.
Endeavor to remove them from her
mind. Act prudently, but as promptly
as possible. That done, induce
her to take an interest in the work
you are going to undertake. She
will lead her father to participate in
it. In a short time, you will see the
good effect on your workmen, and
derive from your charitable efforts the
reward that never fails to follow&mdash;an
ever-increasing love of doing good,
and a livelier desire of sanctifying
your own soul. The exercise of
charity is of all things the most salutary.
I can safely predict that the
Smithson ladies will both become
pious if they second you; and as
for you, you will be more and more
strengthened in your good resolutions.
Who knows?&mdash;perhaps you
may have the sweet surprise of seeing
Mr. Smithson converted when he
sees that Catholicism alone enables
us to confer on others a real benefit.”</p>

<p>“These are fine projects, and very
attractive; but I foresee many obstacles
and dangers.”</p>

<p>“What ones?”</p>

<p>“Of all kinds. First, I expose
myself to conceive an affection for
Mlle. Smithson it would be prudent to
guard against. She does not like me.
I imagine she loves some one else&mdash;the
cousin she praises so willingly.”</p>

<p>“A supposition without proof!
What I have heard from others, as
well as yourself, convinces me that
Mlle. Smithson has not yet made her
choice. The praise she so publicly
lavishes on her cousin is, in my opinion,
a proof of her indifference towards
him.”</p>

<p>“But if I were to love her&mdash;love
her seriously, and she continued to
disdain me; if her prejudice against
me could not be overcome?...”</p>

<p>“I should be the first to regret it.
But listen to me. You were once
truly pious, my friend, and wish to
become so again. This desire is sincere,
I know. Well, it is time to
take a correct view of life. For the
most of us, especially those who are
called to effect some good in the
world, life is only one long sacrifice.
Jesus Christ suffered and died to redeem
mankind; the way he chose
for himself he also appointed for
those who become his disciples. It
is by self-sacrifice that we acquire
the inappreciable gift of being useful
to our fellow-men. Do not cherish
any illusion with regard to this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>Louis and I exchanged a sorrowful
glance as Victor spoke. Poor
dear fellow! how he realized what
he was saying! He was about to
die at thirty-six years of age, in the
very height of his usefulness, and
this because he likewise had voluntarily
chosen the rough path of sacrifice
that was leading even unto
death!</p>

<p>“My friend,” replied Louis, “what
you say is true. I feel it. You are
yourself an eloquent proof of it&mdash;you
whom I have stopped in the midst
of your career....”</p>

<p>“Do not talk so,” interrupted Victor;
“you pain me. Your manner
of interpreting my words makes me
regret uttering them. Do not mistake
my meaning. What I would
say may be summed up thus: to effect
a reformation in Mr. Smithson’s
manufactory, where there are many
bad men who corrupt the good; to
enkindle a spirit of piety in the hearts
of the Smithson ladies, by associating
them in the good you are to effect.
Whatever may be the result, devote
yourself to this work without any reserve.
You must not hesitate!
Your sufferings, if you have any to
endure, will not be without fruit, and
perhaps God may not suffer them to
be of long duration.”</p>

<p>“You have decided me. I will
begin to-morrow. I will commence
with the evening-school, and by visiting
the most destitute families.”</p>

<p>“Do not forget that the destitution
most to be pitied is moral destitution.
Visit those who have nothing,
but especially those who are
depraved.”</p>

<p>Louis went away in a totally different
frame of mind from that with
which he had come. Victor, in his
gentle way, had increased his esteem
for Mr. Smithson, and inflamed him
with the zeal&mdash;the ardent desire of
usefulness with which he was filled
himself. When he was gone, Victor
and I talked a long time about him.
I confessed I had no great faith in
his perseverance. Victor replied:
“His mother’s piety and careful
training must lead to his thorough
conversion. And how he has already
changed! He realizes the
worthlessness of the aims to which
he once gave himself up. There is
no fear of his receding. He has
taken the surest means of persevering&mdash;the
apostolic work of doing
good. Nevertheless, I acknowledge
I wish he could find some one to aid
him. And what a powerful aid it
would be if he loved and felt himself
loved! Ardent as he is, he
would communicate his piety to the
object of his affection. And how
much good would result from their
combined efforts! But I fear it will
not be thus! Our poor friend will,
perhaps, purchase the right of winning
a few souls at the expense of
his own happiness.”</p>

<h3 class="p2">CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class="pc1">LOUIS AT WORK.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Louis</span> took two whole days to reflect
on the important subject of his
conversation with my husband.
Was the profound love he subsequently
felt for Eugénie already
springing up in his heart? Such is
my opinion, though I dare not say
so positively. He probably was not
conscious himself of the real state of
his mind. Since that time, I have
often dwelt on all that took place
then and afterwards, and it has always
seemed to me that, from the
very moment Louis first knew and
appreciated Mlle. Smithson, he conceived
an affection for her as serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
as it was sudden. This affection
was one of those that seem destined,
from the beginning, to a continual increase.
Does this mean that I have
adopted the foolish and erroneous
theory of novel writers, who regard
love as an overmastering passion to
which one is forced at all hazards to
submit?... Neither religion
nor reality will allow one to yield to
such an error. But they do not hinder
me from believing there are inclinations
and affections that all at
once assert themselves with so much
force that, if one would not be
speedily overcome by passion, he
must at once raise an insurmountable
barrier against it, such as flight,
reason armed with contempt, and,
what is a thousand times better than
all&mdash;prayer. Such, in my opinion,
was the love Louis at once conceived
for Mlle. Smithson.</p>

<p>How shall I account for his being
so captivated, when Eugénie had
wounded him so deeply, and was so
proud and every way original?
For he too was proud, and his pride
was allied with an unvarying simplicity
which by no means accorded
with Mlle. Smithson’s turn of mind....
I account for this in many ways.
Eugénie had very distinguished manners.
This naturally pleased Louis,
for he had been brought up by a
mother who was a model of distinction.
Eugénie had a noble soul.
Her opinions were not always correct,
but they were always of an elevated
nature. She was, it is true,
peculiar and romantic, and Louis
was not. But he liked all these peculiarities
in her. They seemed
to him charming. Lastly, and this
is one of my strongest reasons, I
think it was because Louis felt himself
worthy of being Eugénie’s husband,
and, seeing himself slighted by
her, was the more strongly tempted
to win her.</p>

<p>As Victor and I were his confidential
friends, he kept us informed of all
his proceedings, and, I may safely say,
even of his thoughts. It is therefore
easy for me to retrace the story of his
love, which I will do without any
exaggeration.</p>

<p>But first, let us return to his charitable
projects, and the way in which
he executed them. Louis was not
merely an engineer in Mr. Smithson’s
establishment, but a Christian, and
all the more zealous because he was
anxious to expiate his past errors.
He knew by experience to what an
abyss the passions lead, and was desirous
of warning others. If he had
been a man of ordinary mind and
heart, he would no doubt have been
animated by entirely different motives.
After his ruin, and rescue from a
watery grave, desirous of regaining
not only his father’s esteem, but that
of the world, he might have chosen
the very position he now occupied,
but he would have taken care to live
as easily as possible. He would perhaps
have sought to win Eugénie’s
affections, and in the end would have
thought only of her and labored for
her alone. Such a life would not be
worth relating. The lives of ordinary
men are as unworthy of interest as
the egotism that is the mainspring of
their actions.</p>

<p>Louis’ life was a very different one.
That is why I am desirous of making
it known. But do not suppose his
nature was thus transformed in an
instant. God did not work one of
those miracles that consist in the complete,
instantaneous change of a
man’s character. Our faults veil our
better qualities, but do not suppress
them; so a return to piety gives them
new brilliancy, but does not create
them. Louis, as I afterwards learned,
had in his youth manifested uncommon
elevation and purity of mind,
and the piety of a saint. After his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
arrival at manhood, deprived of his
mother’s influence, and led away by
his passions, he placed no bounds to
his follies. But suddenly arrested in
the midst of his disorderly career,
providentially saved at the very
moment of being for ever lost, he at
once broke loose from his pernicious
habits. Like a traveller who returns
to the right path after going astray
for awhile, he resumed his course in
the way of perfection with as much
ardor as if he had never left it. There
was only one reproach to be made
against him at the onset. With his
earnest nature and tendency to extremes,
he manifested too openly the
interior operations of grace. The
difference between the young exquisite
whom everybody knew, and the
new convert observed of all eyes, was
rather too marked. Louis’ serious
and somewhat stern air, his austere
look, and his habitual reserve, repelled
those who had no faith in his entire
conversion. Thence arose backbitings,
suspicions, and accusations
of hypocrisy which did not come to
our poor friend’s ears, but were the
cause of more than one annoyance.
I must, however, acknowledge, to
Mr. Smithson’s credit, that he showed
a great deal of charity for Louis at
that time. If he sometimes accused
him of undue zeal, he was from the
first disposed to believe it sincere.</p>

<p>I will briefly relate what Louis
accomplished during the few weeks
subsequent to his last conversation
with Victor. My husband had advised
him not to undertake anything
till he had consulted Mr. Smithson.
Louis followed his advice, and begged
an interview with his employer. It
was then in the month of June. The
conversation took place without witnesses,
in the open air, on a fine
summer evening. I give it as related
by Louis.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said he, “I am
aware of your interest in benevolent
objects. The workmen you employ,
and whom I superintend under your
orders, are not in your eyes mere instruments
for the increase of wealth,
but men to whom you wish to be as
useful as circumstances will allow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson was never lavish of
his words. He made a sign of assent,
and appeared pleased with what
was said.</p>

<p>Louis continued: “I also am desirous
of being useful to my fellow-men.
I have done many foolish
things, and would like to preserve
others from similar mistakes, for the
consequences are often fatal. With
your permission, I will not content
myself with aiding you in the management
of the mill, but beg the honor
of being associated, in proportion
to my ability, with all the good you
are desirous of doing.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said Mr. Smithson,
“your unexpected offer somewhat
embarrasses me. I am quite ready
to accede to your wishes, but could
not, in truth, consider you my co-laborer.
What I have hitherto done
has been but little, but I know not
what else to do. I assist the needy,
and give good advice here and there;
that is all. You can follow my example.
I shall be glad. Is that
what you wish? Or do you happen
to have anything better and more extensive
to propose? If so, go on. I
am ready to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur; I have some
other plans to suggest.”</p>

<p>“State them without any hesitation.
I only hope they are of a nature
to second my views. The first
condition for that is, to propose
only what is simple and practical.
Doubtless too great an effort cannot
be made at this time to aid and improve
our workmen, both for their
own interest and for ours. Everything
is dear. The country is in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
ferment. Among those we employ,
there are a number of turbulent fellows
and many wretchedly poor.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so. What I wish is,
to aid the needy, and reform the
bad.”</p>

<p>“Your design is worthy of all
praise&mdash;as a theory; ... but its
realization will be difficult, not to say
impossible. Listen to me, monsieur;
I have a frank avowal to make. I
have been engaged in this business
but a short time. I know the common
people but little. I belong to a
country and a religion that have a
special way of aiding the indigent.
The government takes charge of that
with us. In France, it is different:
private individuals take part in it.
You find me therefore greatly embarrassed.
Enlighten me, if you can.
I ask for nothing better.”</p>

<p>“Well, monsieur, it seems to me
that beneficence should be exercised
in three different ways. First, it is
our duty to come to the assistance
of those in distress; ... only I
cannot, in this respect, do all I would
like.... I could have done so
once ... now ...”</p>

<p>“Do not let that worry you. My
purse is open to you on condition
that you only aid those whose destitution
you can personally vouch for.
It is also advisable to ascertain what
use they make of that which is given
them.”</p>

<p>“I promise this, and thank you.
No; it is not sufficient to give them
money. One must see it is made a
good use of. The poor should be
taught to double their resources by
economy. The assistance of the
needy, then, is the first benevolent
effort I would propose. I now come
to moral beneficence. This does not
refer to the indigence of the body,
but to that of the soul. I think it
especially desirable to preserve from
corruption those of our workmen
who are at present leading upright
lives, particularly the young. This
does not hinder me from thinking it
necessary to bring those who have
gone astray under good influences.”</p>

<p>“Fine projects! I, too, have made
similar ones, as I said, but I was discouraged
by the difficulty of executing
them. What means do you propose
to employ?”</p>

<p>“What would you say to the formation
of a library in one of the
rooms of the manufactory&mdash;for instance,
that which overlooks the
river? It is now unoccupied. The
workmen might be allowed to go
there and read in the evening, and
even to smoke, if they like.... This
library could be used, during the hours
of cessation from labor, as a schoolroom,
where all could come to learn,
in a social way, what they are ignorant
of.&mdash;Would not this be a means of
keeping them away from the wine-shops,
and afford one an opportunity
of conversing with them, and giving
them good advice&mdash;advice which
comes from the heart?”</p>

<p>“I like the idea. It really seems
to me you have conceived a happy
combination of plans; but nothing
can be done without a person to put
them in execution.”</p>

<p>“I will do it if you will allow me.
I am eager to try the experiment.”</p>

<p>“Your courage and enthusiasm
will soon give out. At every step,
you will meet with difficulties impossible
to be foreseen. I have mingled
only a little with the working classes,
but enough to know they are difficult
to manage, and often ungrateful to
those who try to be useful to them.”</p>

<p>“God will aid me. He will reward
me, and they may too. But I shall
not be difficult to please. If some
of them correspond to my efforts, it
will be enough. I will forget the ingratitude
of the rest.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson was amazed at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
zeal. His own religion, cold and
formal, had never taught him to take
so much pains for those who might
prove ungrateful. He and Louis
separated quite pleased with each
other. Louis felt he had been comprehended.
He had also the promise
of assistance. Mr. Smithson,
with all his reserve, was captivated
by Louis’ enthusiasm for doing good.
But though he had promised to aid
Louis, he pitied him. “He will fail,”
he said to himself.</p>

<p>The work was begun a few days
after, thanks to the co-operation of
Mr. Smithson, who smoothed away
the difficulties inseparable from all
beginnings. At seven in the evening,
Louis, laying aside the title and functions
of an engineer, became the friend
and teacher of the workmen. They
assembled in a large room where
benches, tables, and a library were
arranged. At first a certain number
of workmen came through mere curiosity.
They found what they did
not expect&mdash;a teacher who was competent,
kind, ready to converse with
them and teach them what they
wished to learn, and this with a heartiness
quite different from an ordinary
schoolmaster. Louis devoted himself
with so much pleasure to these
evening exercises that his pupils soon
learned to like them, and gave so
captivating an account of them to
the rest that the number of scholars
increased from day to day. Thus
the school was permanently established
without much delay, and numbered
about thirty men of all ages and
varieties of character. Louis showed
perfect tact in profiting by so happy
a commencement. Every evening,
he gave oral instructions, sometimes
on historical subjects, sometimes on
a question of moral or political economy.
In each of these lectures, the
young master mingled good advice,
which was willingly listened to,
given, as it was, in the midst of instructions
that excited the liveliest
interest. The workmen felt they were
learning a thousand things they could
never have acquired from books.
A book is a voiceless teacher that
requires too much application from
unaccustomed pupils.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson watched over the
development of this work, and became
more and more interested in it in
proportion as its success, which at
first he had doubted, became more
probable, and its utility more evident.
At the same time, without acknowledging
it to himself, suspicion and
distrust began to spring up in his
heart. Even the best of men under
certain circumstances, unless checked
by profound piety, are accessible
to the lowest sentiments. Mr.
Smithson began to be jealous of his
assistant, and even to fear him.</p>

<p>“What!” he said to himself, “shall
he succeed in a work I dared not
undertake myself! He will acquire
a moral influence in the establishment
superior to mine!...” Then, as his
unjust suspicions increased: “It is
not the love of doing good that influences
him: it is ambition,” he
thought.</p>

<p>Louis had no suspicion of what
was passing in his employer’s mind,
and therefore resolutely continued to
pursue the course he had begun.
He had formerly accompanied his
mother in her visits among the poor,
and thus learned how to benefit them.
She had taught him it was not sufficient
to give them money: it was
necessary to mingle with them, talk
with them, give them good advice&mdash;in
a word, to treat them as brethren
and friends. Having organized his
evening-school, he resolved to visit
the most destitute and ignorant
families in the village, which was
about a kilometre and a half from
the manufactory. He went there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
every evening towards six, and spent
an hour in going from one house to
another. Chance, as an unbeliever
would say, or Providence, to speak
more correctly, led him to the house
of a poor woman quite worthy of his
interest. She was fifty years of age,
and slowly wasting away from disease
of the lungs, complicated with an
affection of the heart. This woman
was one of those lovely souls developed
by the Catholic religion oftener
than is supposed. People little suspected
how much she suffered, or
with how much patience she bore
her sufferings, but God knew. She
was a real martyr. Married to a
drunken, brutal man of her own age,
she had endured all the abuse and ill-treatment
with which he loaded her
without a murmur. She had brought
up her son piously, and labored as
long as she was able to supply her
own wants and those of her child.
Broken down by illness and the continual
ill-treatment of her husband,
she would have died of want, had
not Mlle. Smithson come to her
aid.</p>

<p>When Louis went to see this poor
woman, whom we will call Françoise,
she spoke of Eugénie so enthusiastically,
and with so much emotion, that
he was greatly impressed. It was
sweet to hear the praises of one whom
he dreamed, if not of marrying, at
least of associating in his good
works.</p>

<p>The next day, he repeated his call
on the sick woman, and for several
days in succession. I think he had
a secret hope of meeting Eugénie,
without daring to acknowledge it to
himself. As yet, he had merely seen
her. He found her, as you know,
handsome, stylish, and intelligent, but
cool towards him. He longed to
observe her in this miserable dwelling.
Here, apart from other influences, she
might show herself, as he hoped she
really was&mdash;exempt from the imperfections
he had remarked in her at
home with regret. Without acknowledging
it, he loved her, and it is hard
to be forced to pass an unfavorable
judgment on those we love. But
days passed without their meeting.
The sick woman was visibly failing.
One evening, Louis found her weaker
than ever.</p>

<p>“My dear monsieur,” said she,
“I am very happy. I am about to
enter the presence of the good God!
But I have one cause for anxiety at
the hour of death. I depend on you
to remove it. When the wealthy die,
they leave their friends valuable legacies,
but we poor people have only
burdens to bequeath. Mlle. Eugénie
has promised to watch over my little
boy. She is very kind!... And
I have another favor to ask of you,
monsieur. Not far from the village
is a family by the name of Vinceneau.
The father is employed in the tile
works you have to pass in coming to
see me. Hereafter, when you come
by, continue to think of me, and pray
for me!... But that is not the
point. The man I am speaking of is
intemperate like my husband. The
mother would be an excellent woman,
were it not for two faults. She is
indolent and envious&mdash;always ready
to think evil of the rich. She works
at your mill. It is not these two
people I am going to recommend to
you, but their daughter. The poor
child is as handsome as a picture, and
as pious as an angel. She often
comes to see me. I tremble lest she
be lost through the bad example of
her parents, or through dangerous
society. I have a feeling that, in
some way, you will find means of
being useful to her, if necessary. I
should have recommended her to
Mlle. Eugénie, but her father and
mother, as I have said, are good for
nothing, and I should not like to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
mademoiselle where I know she is
detested on account of her wealth.”</p>

<p>Louis gladly acceded to her request.
He left a few moments after
to attend his evening-school. Half-way
home, he perceived Eugénie
coming from the mill, and could not
help meeting her.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c348" id="c348">THE POLITICAL PRINCIPLE OF THE SOCIAL RESTORATION
OF FRANCE.</a></h2>

<p class="pc1">BY F. RAMIERE, S.J.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">FROM LES ETUDES RELIGIEUSES.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> great danger of France at the
present time is neither the decline
of her military power, nor the diminution
of her political influence, nor
the deep wound inflicted on her finances
by an enormous war contribution,
nor the aggrandizement of
Prussia, nor even the unchaining of
the Revolution: it is the division
among right-thinking men.</p>

<p>Supposing that all men in or out of
the Assembly, united by the indissoluble
bond of principle, sincerely desired
the re-establishment of order,
the revolutionary monster would soon
be rendered harmless. The healthy
influences now paralyzed would regain
their action; with security,
legitimate interests would recover
their power of expansion; the vital
strength of the country would develop
rapidly; and, thanks to the vigorous
elasticity which characterizes our race,
we would soon resume the rank in
Europe that belongs to us.</p>

<p>Let us recollect the wonderful
promptitude with which France, reduced
to extremity by the religious
wars, reached the apogee of her
prosperity under Louis XIII. We
would rise again with equal facility,
if the good dispositions, not wanting
in France, could be bound together,
and oppose a compact fasces to the
revolutionary passions, alas! too well
united for destruction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not so. Unity
of thought and action, which is the
supreme necessity of every government,
is wanting to-day in those who
are alone able to save us, and it has
become the exclusive privilege of the
party that is working for our ruin.
M. Le Play, who, in a recent treatise,
warns us of the danger of the situation,
sees but one remedy: the abandonment
for a time at least of political
questions, and the concentration of
the efforts of all true men for the
study and solution of the social question.
Says M. Le Play: “The enlightened
men who compose the
majority of our Assembly render
themselves powerless by their division
on what is called the political
question&mdash;that is to say, on the form
of sovereignty. They may be assured
that each political party, when it
advances its principle, raises against
it a majority formed by the coalition
of rival parties. When, on the contrary,
this same party takes up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
social question, that is to say, the
immediate interest of the family, it
gains the majority, sometimes even
unanimity. It is sufficient to know
the cause of the evil to find the
remedy. The conservatives have the
power to establish a strong majority.
It is only necessary to avoid the
subject that divides them, and to
devote themselves to the one that
draws them together.”</p>

<p>There is much truth in this observation,
and we are far from wishing
to combat it on the whole. The
eminent publicist who, in this same
work, accords so favorable an opinion
to our studies on the rights of men,
knows with what warm sympathy we
follow his useful labors for social reform.
We appreciate as fully as he
the importance of the question to
which he desires to draw the attention
of all true friends of order.
With him we believe that the social
order is anterior to the political, and
that, at a time when society is disorganized
even in its original elements,
it is there above all that the remedy
must be applied. How can a good
government be given to a nation that
the anti-social propaganda has rendered
ungovernable?</p>

<p>We must acknowledge, however,
that, to the rule which M. Le Play
has laid down, objections arise which
at the first glance appear sufficiently
grave. We have heard intelligent
men doubt whether even the temporary
withdrawal of the political
questions would be opportune or
possible, and that for several reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, because these
questions are irresistibly imposed
upon us. They are discussed every
day in the debates of the Assembly
or by the press. If we give up treating
them according to true principles,
they will certainly be determined in
the sense of the Revolution.</p>

<p>In effect, and it is a second reason,
if men of order deny themselves entrance
on this ground, it is indispensable
that the revolutionary party
should promise to abstain likewise.
But how can we hope that it will
make, much less that it will observe,
this engagement? The first aim of
this party is evidently to possess itself
of political power, by means of which
it will be easy to realize its anti-social
theories. We must put forth our
whole strength in this contest, if we
do not wish to have it become impossible
for us to defend the social interests.</p>

<p>Finally, here is a consideration
which, to the eyes of the men whose
sentiments we express, appears still
more decisive. They say that in
order to make it possible to abstract
political questions, and give ourselves
exclusively to the study of the social,
there should be a line of demarcation
drawn between these two domains so
closely united. This is what they
cannot accomplish. Social and political
rights repose on the same basis,
they have the same enemies, and are
attacked with the same arms. Why
is the family disorganized? Why, in
labor, is the harmony so necessary
between the employer and the employed
replaced by an antagonism
equally hurtful to both? Is it not,
above all, because every rank of society
suffers from the rebound of the
attacks made politically on the principle
of authority?</p>

<p>We do not dispute the fatal influence
of the false principles pointed out
by M. Le Play&mdash;the original perfection
preached by Rousseau, the native
equality of men maintained by
Alexis de Tocqueville, have had their
share, and their great share, in the
disorders which have totally overthrown
society. But the principal
cause of these disorders, the revolutionary
principle by excellence, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
negation of all authority superior to
that of man!</p>

<p>How shall we answer these arguments?
It will not be difficult. We
can admit them without injury to the
thesis of M. Le Play. We would misapprehend
him if we placed the Christian
principle of authority among the
number of political questions which
he counsels us to avoid. This principle,
in reality, is not less social than
political. It is the common foundation
of these two orders, the fourth
commandment of the decalogue,
and, consequently, constitutes one of
the essential articles of the social
restoration, whose complete programme
M. Le Play finds in the
decalogue.</p>

<p>What are the political questions
we should avoid, if we would see
union and strength succeed to the
divisions which now paralyze us?
Those that spring from opinions.</p>

<p>Opinions divide parties, and create
among them interminable struggles.
S. Augustine has well said: <i>In necessariis,
unitas; in dubiis, libertas.</i>
Necessary principles are the domain
of unity; doubtful opinions, by provoking
liberty, engender division.
It is in the very essence of opinion
to arouse against it other opinions,
to which their probability, more or
less great, gives the right to struggle
against every light but that of proof.
Here is, then, what experience
teaches us, and what the dangers of
society command us: it is to lift ourselves
above this obscure and troubled
region where opinions clash,
and to rise to the peaceful sphere
that principles illumine with a steady
light. Here there can be no subject
of division among sincere minds.
In the social as in the political order,
principles convince by their proofs
all intellects which have not made a
compact with error; and their necessity,
as incontestable as their
truth, conquers the adhesion of all
just men.</p>

<p>We can, then, without contradicting
M. Le Play, establish the following
proposition: to obtain this union
among right-thinking men, without
which there is no salvation to be
hoped for France, political parties
must be silent on the questions which
divide them, and cling to the immutable
principle whose negation is the
chief cause of our misfortunes.</p>

<p>But what is this principle? This
is the question we will endeavor to
answer with a precision which will
leave no doubt in sincere minds; no
pretext for the division of parties.</p>

<p>Our aim is very clear, and we
hope it will be understood by our
readers. We do not intend to discuss
the various political opinions,
still less to ask their defenders to sacrifice
them; we seek the indisputable,
the first principle of the political
order, around which can be immediately
formed that union of honest
and upright men which will
place them in a position to struggle
against the Revolution, and will
prepare for the future a more complete
harmony, and the permanent
restoration of France.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>We must, above all, distinguish
clearly “the saving principle” from
the opinions with which it might be
confounded. It will be easier to understand
what it is when we will
have said what it is not.</p>

<p>In the first place, this principle is
not that of <i>absolute monarchy</i>.</p>

<p>In the happiest period of our
history, the power of the monarch
was modified by institutions of various
kinds: by the states-general,
which, having the right to confirm
or reject new taxes, afforded an opportunity
of laying at the foot of the
throne the complaints and the wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of the country; by the magistrates,
who, almost sovereign in the judicial
order, exercised an efficacious control
over the legislature; by the
church above all, that energetically
defended the supremacy of divine
law against the caprices of princes.
Whatever may be thought of the
causes which, after the invasion of
Protestantism, led to the destruction
of these guarantees, and to the concentration
of power; whatever may
be said to excuse or glorify absolute
monarchy in the past, it evidently
cannot now be presented as the immutable
principle through which we
could ask our salvation.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to add that the
inferior institutions which surrounded
the monarchy at divers epochs, merit
still less the name of principles.
Formerly these institutions had a
reason for existing, but nothing
proves that they should survive the
circumstances which gave them birth.
Neither the warlike feudalism of the
middle ages nor the nobility disarmed,
but still privileged, of later
times, belongs to those elements essential
to all society, to which we are
bound to restore their energy as soon
as possible, if we would not condemn
ourselves to perish.</p>

<p>Nor can we give the name of principle
to <i>divine right</i> as understood
by the Gallican school. According
to this school, Providence, at the commencement
of society, chose a man
or a family to exercise the supreme
power. The course of events which
decided the form of government of
infant societies was, in its opinion, a
manifestation of the divine will sufficient
to invest with the right of
commanding those who had the
strength to enforce it. This right is
then divine, since it is held immediately
from God; and, in the language
of theology, the power of divine right
is that which comes from God without
passing through any human intermediary.
The Gallican school
recognized two sovereignties of divine
right: that of the temporal
order, which was royalty; and the
papal sovereignty, which was spiritual&mdash;if
it was allowable to say in this
system that the pope was sovereign,
since, contrary to the policy which
sustained absolute political power,
they wished in the spiritual order
that the pope should share his sovereignty
with the episcopate.</p>

<p>To dissimulate nothing, let us say
here that lately theologians and Catholic
philosophers, strangers to the
Gallican school, have defended the
thesis of divine right. But their adhesion,
in giving new weight to this
doctrine, does not take it from the
category of simple opinions. It has
always against it the arguments and
authority of our most illustrious doctors,
according to whom the right of
princes is divine only in its first origin
and in its abstract essence; but
in its immediate origin, its concrete
form, and in the appointment of the
subject to be invested with it, this
right is human, since it would only
receive the determinations indispensable
to its exercise by the expressed
or tacit consent of society. The
providential events of which we
have before spoken were more or
less indicative of the divine will, but
the majority of doctors refuse to see
in them a sufficient motive for investing
with the right of commanding
a man previously supposed to be
without it.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the <i>absolute inamissibility
of power</i> generally maintained
by the partisans of divine right
should also be ranked among the
disputed opinions. It is logic that
he who has received power immediately
from God can only be deprived
of it by God. The defenders of the
opposite opinion admit, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
that, in extreme cases, power
can be withdrawn from him who
abuses it by only using for the destruction
of society what was given
to him for its preservation. And as
it is difficult to distinguish in such
cases, as error on such occasions
could only be disastrous, as anarchy
could easily spring from the most
legitimate resistance to tyranny,
Catholic theologians do not wish
that these doubtful cases of conscience
should be left to the passions
of parties or to the blind fury of the
mob; but they find a guarantee
qualified to defend every right and
to reassure every interest in the authority,
ever impartial and paternal,
of the Vicar of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The first basis of social order
which we are now seeking, can neither
be found in the <i>monarchical principle</i>.</p>

<p>In reality, whatever may be to the
minds of the greatest philosophers
the prerogatives of a limited monarchy,
they cannot maintain that it is
the only legitimate form of government;
and consequently, as the monarchical
principle is neither universal,
absolute, nor immutable, it has none
of the marks of a true principle.</p>

<p>Besides, the firmest partisans of
monarchy do not assume for it this
universal necessity. In the states with
which it is identified, by long and legitimate
possession, with the principle
of right, they justly claim for it
all the prerogatives of that principle.
Unreasonable as it would be to pretend
that monarchy is the only legitimate
government for all times and
all peoples, equally absurd would it
be to maintain that, when it is legitimately
established, it can be legitimately
combated and overthrown.
There is no right against right. The
monarchical principle thus defended
has no adversaries but those fanatical
adorers of the republican form
whose absolutism is a hundred times
more unreasonable than ever was
that of the most servile worshippers
of royal power.</p>

<p>These topsy-turvy legitimists condemn,
from the height of their pride,
the immense majority of the human
race, arrogating to themselves in
favor of their opinion the authority
which they refuse to the church of
God; and they take to themselves,
in remaking it, the motto with which
they have so often reproached us:
No salvation outside of the republic!
After twenty-five centuries, they renew
the foolish enterprise of the
Babylonian despot: they wish to
compel all the nations under the sun
to prostrate themselves before the
statue of their republic, and acknowledge
it as the only true divinity.</p>

<p>No more tyrannical intolerance
can be imagined. Whence do these
absolutists derive the right of imposing
their opinions on their equals?
From what have they taken the halo
with which they surround the cap of
liberty, after having trampled all
crowns under their feet? Undoubtedly,
government exists but for the
people, but does it follow that it
should necessarily be exercised by
the people? To refute their exclusive
theories, it would be sufficient
to compel them to make an application
of them in their own families.
In fact, from the moment that the
principle becomes absolute, it should
be applied to all authority; and there
is no reason why the family and the
workshop should not share with the
state the advantages of the republican
form.</p>

<p>But it is waste of time to dwell
on this fanaticism, of which, thank
God, we do not find a trace among
the partisans of monarchy. The necessity
which they attribute to it is
not absolute, but hypothetical. They
affirm that monarchy is the only form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of government suited to the characters,
defects, customs, and traditions
of certain peoples. They say that
nations, like individuals, have different
temperaments; and, consequently, it
would be absurd to impose the same
rule on all. Nations, like individuals,
when the constitution is formed, when
inveterate habits have become a second
nature, cannot, without danger,
suddenly adopt new customs. What
would become of a people who
should persist in making this dangerous
experiment? Against their will,
they would carry their old customs
into the new system; they would
preserve their monarchical manners in
the midst of a nominal republic; and
this bastard government would have
all the inconveniences of the monarchy,
without its stability and other
advantages.</p>

<p>More even than individuals, nations
live by traditions. By them,
the past extends its influence over
the present, illumines it with the reflection
of its glory, and animates it
with its spirit. Traditions bind together
the successive periods in a
nation’s existence, and preserve
among its children the unity produced
by a long community of dangers
and struggles, of triumphs and
reverses. A people that breaks with
tradition is like an uprooted tree;
its existence is similar to that of a
man, who, having lost his memory,
cannot connect the present with the
past. Now, it is evident that a nation
whose institutions and customs
for centuries have reposed on monarchy
cannot have this basis overthrown
without breaking all traditions,
and throwing society entirely
out of its beaten tracks.</p>

<p>These observations are evidently
the dictates of good sense and experience.
It is impossible not to be
vividly struck by them, when one
has lived among a people faithful to
its traditions; as the English, for example.
Nothing is more striking
than the contrast between the general
security, the vitality, the friendly enjoyments,
whose source is respect for
tradition, with the instability and
anxiety which the Revolution has
produced in our French society, formerly
so calm and joyous.</p>

<p>But however well grounded may
be this induction, it cannot take the
place of the absolute and indisputable
principle by which we wish to
bind together all true and earnest
men.</p>

<p>Let us pursue our research, and
congratulate ourselves on being dispensed
in our present position from
pausing at the thorny distinction between
the <i>power of right</i> and the
<i>power of fact</i>. For too long a period
has this been a cause of incurable
division between the most honest
and religious men. Of all the problems
which belong to the social
order, it is perhaps the most difficult
to resolve practically. On one side,
it is certain that the violation of right
cannot destroy it, and that the
usurper who, to gratify his ambition,
imperils the gravest interests of society,
does not become legitimate,
even though his attempt be crowned
by success. On the other side, however,
the maintenance of public order
being the reason of the existence
of the rights of power, obedience
cannot be refused to him who alone
has the strength and the means of
attaining this indispensable end.</p>

<p>From this springs one of those conflicts
of opinion which make the
social question so difficult. The
same public order which commands
obedience to the usurper alone capable
of defending it, forbids encouraging
the ambition of future usurpers
by the full acceptation of triumphant
crime. The friends of order can
then follow different paths, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
to the preference they may have for
either of these interests. The power
of fact will attract men who, most
affected by present necessity, will
hope to find in their adhesion to the
established order a safeguard against
new convulsions. Others will see in
this adhesion to the revolution consummated
an anticipated sanction
of future revolutions, and will think
themselves obliged to provide for the
permanent necessities of society by
remaining faithful to the fallen power.</p>

<p>This is not the place to decide
such a difficult question, where even
the supreme authority of the church
has thought it often wiser to abstain.
We need only state as a fact, unfortunate
as inevitable, the division
which springs from this conflict of
duty. It will last until the illegitimate
power is overthrown, or until,
by the lapse of time, all trace of its
origin is lost. In the first case, the
transitory right which the usurping
government borrowed from fact
having disappeared with the fact,
the power of right recovers its preponderance.
In the second case,
fact is transformed into right by becoming
alone capable of defending
society; and legitimacy, of which
social interest was the base, will disappear
with the real possibility of
saving this supreme interest.</p>

<p>It is what happened in England,
where the tories, the former partisans
of the Stuarts, have long since adhered
to the reigning dynasty. But
in France, neither of the two dynasties
which succeeded to that of our
ancient kings established its domination
firmly enough, or sufficiently renounced
its revolutionary principle,
to render evident to all eyes this
union of right and fact. For fifty
years, we have seen conservatives,
religious men, and even the clergy,
divided into two or three political
fractions; and this division has not
been one of the least causes of our
weakness, and of the growing strength
of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The evil appeared irremediable,
and each day it acquired fresh gravity;
for the government of fact, instead
of seeing in the adhesion of
men of order a motive for returning
openly to conservative principles, believed
it to be their interest to conciliate
the men of disorder by supporting
the principle of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Providence has drawn us from this
position, apparently inextricable, and,
by the result even of our faults, has
made the cause of our divisions disappear.
The Revolution has destroyed
the governments blind enough to
lean upon her. The power which
exists to-day, and whose strength
lies in the Assembly, has more than
once acknowledged its provisional
character. France is, then, free to
return to the true principles of order,
and to reunite under one flag all
those who are sincerely devoted to
the holy cause. Nothing prevents
her fulfilling a celebrated prediction,
and to close, by the proclamation of
the rights of God, the revolution
which opened with the proclamation
of the rights of man.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Herein lies our salvation: to the
revolutionary principle, which weakens
all powers and all social rights,
in making them depend on man’s
caprice, we must oppose the Christian
principle, which gives them an
immovable solidity, in reposing them
on the supreme authority of God.</p>

<p>No innovation is required: we
must simply return to the eternal
law’s of social order. If imprudent
architects attempt to change the
laws of equilibrium, what should be
done to repair the ruins accumulated
by their folly? Remember those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
laws, and enforce their observation.
There is also an equilibrium in the
moral order, and it was the unpardonable
fault of our fathers that
they overlooked its most essential
condition. Let us hasten to restore
all splendor to the truth whose darkening
was the cause of our misfortunes.
Foreseen and accepted without
dispute by the pagans themselves,
this generative dogma of society
was, in the dawn of Christianity, promulgated
by S. Paul as one of the
principal articles of revealed religion;
and it did not cease to rule the nations
of Europe until the epoch
when, with the law of Christ, order
and peace were driven from their
confines. Reason and religion are
in perfect harmony when they proclaim
the Christian principle. They
tell us, with one voice, that God, who
directs all with so much wisdom in
the material world, wishes equally,
and with much more reason, that
order should reign in the moral. In
commanding men to unite in society,
so as to assure by their common
efforts the happiness of all, he imposes
on them an obligation to bridle
the selfish passions which unceasingly
conspire against the general
interest. And as the only efficacious
means of keeping them in
order is the institution of a power
armed with strength for the defence
of the right, God wills that this
power should be created, if it does
not exist, and obeyed when it exists.</p>

<p>Thus, according to the teaching
of Christianity, civil power is divine
in its origin, and, although a human
element must interpose in the principle
to determine the form and choose
the depositary, he that is once
elected commands really in the
name of God. “All power comes
from God,” says S. Paul; it is by order
of God that it exists, and consequently
it cannot be resisted without
resisting the order of God, and without
drawing down the damnation
justly reserved for those who revolt
against God.</p>

<p>It is evident that between this
principle which belongs to Catholic
faith, and the Gallican opinion of divine
right, the difference is not so
great as would at first appear. Both
parties agree as to the origin of power,
its mission, its rights, and its duties.
Only on one point do they differ:
according to one, the man who,
in the commencement, was invested
with power, received it immediately
from God; while the other holds that
the investiture was made by the expressed
or tacit consent of society.
This divergence is clearly more speculative
than practical, as, with this
exception, they both believe the same
doctrine.</p>

<p>It is therefore wrong to seek any
analogy between the revolutionary
theory and the opinion of Catholic
doctors the most favorable to the
primitive rights of society. It is only
necessary to thoroughly understand
their doctrine to see this resemblance,
which is merely apparent, instantly
vanish. According to them,
it is true that power depends for its
first organization on those whom it
will soon command; but once constituted,
it is independent of them in
its exercise within the limits inherent
in the form of government. Society,
in reality, is not the source of the authority
with which it invests its elect:
it is only the channel. If it has the
right to determine the form and to
choose the subject, it is also obliged
to make use of this right, and to arm
the power instituted by it with the
full prerogatives necessary for the
maintenance of order.</p>

<p>Nothing is wanting to authority
thus understood; it has a precise
end and an indispensable reason for
being&mdash;the defence of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
rights, and the maintenance of public
order. It has an immutable base&mdash;the
will of God, the guarantee of
rights and the protector of order. It
has a universal and inevitable sanction&mdash;the
eternal punishment which
the contemners of the law cannot
escape, even though they succeed in
avoiding temporal chastisement. In
resting social order on the first principle
of all things, this doctrine
places it in perfect harmony with the
general order of the universe; and
it is as satisfactory in theory to the
mind of the philosopher as it is efficacious
in practice in maintaining
the order of society. Equally favorable
to all legitimate interests, it elevates
at the same time the majesty
of power and the dignity of obedience;
for, if it is glorious for rulers to
command in the name of God, it is
not less so for the governed to obey
only God.</p>

<p>What, on the contrary, is the effect
of the revolutionary principle? Instead
of establishing authority, it destroys
it; and, under the pretext of
elevating obedience, degrades it.</p>

<p>It destroys authority; for there is
no true authority, except where a superior
will is invested with the right
to command, and an inferior one is
obliged to obey. Now, these two
conditions cannot be realized in the
revolutionary theory. The principle
of this theory, such as Rousseau
laid it down in his <i>Social Contract</i>, is
that the power placed over civil society
draws all its rights from the
free concession of those whom it is
called to command. It is, then, their
mandatary, and not their superior;
consequently, it has no more the
right to command them than they
are bound to obey it. Rousseau says
it in these very terms: in obeying it,
they only obey themselves; and, consequently,
they can, when they please,
dispense themselves from obedience.</p>

<p>Thus, instead of creating authority,
the revolutionary principle renders it
impossible; and since authority is
the essential condition of the stability,
strength, well-being, and existence
even of society, it cannot be denied
that this principle is the overthrow
of social order.</p>

<p>But at the same time that it annihilates
the majesty of power, it debases
the dignity of obedience. It is
very well to say to the members of
society that, in obeying their mandatary,
they only obey themselves; it
will not prevent them in a thousand
circumstances from being directed to
do the contrary of what they would
like. What will then happen? If the
discontented are numerous and strong
enough to make their will prevail
over that of power, they will revolt;
but, if resistance is impossible, they
will be compelled to obey. What
will be this obedience? The act
of a slave who yields to force, and
not the act of a reasonable man and
a Christian who conforms his will to
that of God.</p>

<p>Instead of the alliance which Christian
doctrine establishes between the
majesty of power and the dignity of
obedience, the revolutionary theory
creates an irreconcilable antagonism
between these two essential elements
of society; it is only by degrading
the subjects that the rulers
can ensure the execution of their
orders.</p>

<p>This radical and absolute opposition
between the two doctrines necessarily
extends to their consequences.
Whilst the Christian principle
gives an inviolable stability to power,
and guarantees with equal efficacy
the rights of the subjects, the revolutionary
principle has for result inevitable
anarchy and tyranny.</p>

<p>Anarchy first; for how can a power
which is absolutely without a base
sustain itself for any length of time?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Consistently with itself, the theory of
the Revolution intends that society,
in establishing power as its mandatary,
should not strip itself in any
manner of sovereignty. As society
created it freely, by an act of its own
will it can reverse it when it seems
desirable, without any one having
the right to demand an account of its
acts. As a consequence, the revolutionary
theory involves daily appeals
to new <i>plébiscites</i> and to new elections
for the overthrow of the established
power, and the substitution
of another more in accord with the
present will of the nation; and, as the
triumph of the discontented of yesterday
will infallibly create other dissatisfied
ones, these will have the
right to organize to-morrow a new
agitation to overthrow everything.</p>

<p>The constitution cannot legitimately
reprove or arrest these attempts;
for, emanating like the government
from the national will, it is also subordinate
to the fluctuations of that capricious
sovereign. The small number
of the agitators can be no objection;
and you cannot oppose to them
the wishes and rights of the majority.
If there is no authority superior to
that of man, all human wills are
equal, and all equally sovereign. The
number of those who differ from me
gives them a preponderating force,
but it does not confer on them a superior
right. If, then, I think my
sentiment the best, nothing can hinder
me from working to make it prevail.
By making use of intrigue and
violence, the smallest minority easily
becomes the majority; and, with
strength, it acquires the right to do
all that the revolutionary principle
attributes to majorities.</p>

<p>What can be opposed to this argument?
Is it not perfectly logical?
If the consequences appear intolerable,
there is but one means of escape&mdash;the
return to Christian principle,
alone capable of preserving social
order from the convulsions to which
it is condemned by these attempts
against power. Christian doctrine
repels the attacks made upon public
order with much more severity than
the violations of individual rights; it
brands them as crimes of treason
against society. Except in the extreme
cases of which we have already
spoken, it declares power inviolable;
not in virtue of the personal prerogative
of him who is invested with it,
but in virtue of the interest of which
he is the necessary guarantee.</p>

<p>Thus we have heard S. Paul tell
us that he who resists power resists
the order of God, and draws damnation
on his head. This sentence, we
know, does not agree with the verdict
of public opinion, as indulgent in regard
to political crimes as it is severe
against those which come under the
head of crimes of common right.</p>

<p>On which side is the truth? If
public power is the indispensable bulwark
of individual rights, can the attempt
be made to overthrow it, without,
at the same time, attacking all
those rights? If a man, who, during
the night, forces his entrance into a
house, and seeks to enrich himself to
the prejudice of the legitimate possessor,
is thrown into prison as a criminal
unworthy of compassion, how can
he merit less severe punishment who
shakes the entire social edifice, to
gratify his cupidity and ambition at
the expense of the public peace?
Nothing is clearer: in listening to the
revolutionary theories in preference
to the Christian doctrine, public
opinion is in complete disagreement
with reason.</p>

<p>Would to God that it was all
limited to a theoretical opposition!
Unfortunately, nothing is more practical
than revolutionary error; as, for
a century, the conclusions to which
logic has led us have been but too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
well confirmed by experience. Nothing,
then, is wanting to enable us
to judge the two rival doctrines with
full knowledge of the case. We have
seen them at work&mdash;one for fourteen
centuries, the other during the age
nearest our own time; they have
given their measure, and are known
by their fruits. One, in semi-barbarous
times, endowed France with the
unity, glory, concentration of strength,
and expansion which placed her in
the first rank among the nations of
the world; the other, in an age of
advanced civilization and unheard-of
material progress, heaped ruins upon
ruins on our unfortunate country&mdash;religious
ruin, moral ruin, social ruin,
political ruin, financial ruin, military
ruin&mdash;nothing remained standing
when with the principle of authority
the necessary foundation of society
was overthrown.</p>

<p>And let it not be imagined that, in
thus delivering the social body to the
ravages of anarchy, the revolutionary
principle guarantees it against the
rigors of tyranny. No; it condemns
it inevitably to suffer those rigors.
At the same time that it disarms
power with regard to the wicked passions,
it arms it with an all-powerful
force against the most sacred rights.
Rousseau avowed it frankly; and,
from the Convention to Prince Bismarck,
all revolutionary governments
have practised this lesson. Nothing
escapes the sovereignty of the state
from the moment that the state is
emancipated from the authority of
God. The soul of the citizen belongs
to it with the same title as his body;
the questions of doctrine are not more
independent of its control than those
of policy; the church and the school
are under its jurisdiction as well as
the public streets and the prison.</p>

<p>Since society recognizes no authority
above it, and the state represents
the social will, it is absolute master,
it is all-powerful, it is God. It is the
state that makes justice and truth,
that creates rights, that is the supreme
arbiter of conscience; and its omnipotence,
as unlimited as fragile, leaves
to the citizen but the choice between
two expedients: either to bend with
docility under its yoke by abdicating
all moral dignity, or to overthrow it,
with the certainty of seeing it replaced
by an equal tyranny.</p>

<p>Thus the revolutionary theory,
which is permanent anarchy, is at the
same time organized despotism. At
other periods, we have seen society,
deprived of its equilibrium, oscillate
between these two extremes, passing
in turn from anarchy to tyranny, and
from tyranny to anarchy. Thanks
to revolutionary progress, we can enjoy
simultaneously the advantages
of these two states, and taste the vexations
of despotism, without escaping
the agitations of anarchy. Since the
proclamation of the pretended liberal
principles, we have seen disappear
the liberties which, under the most
absolute systems, were considered as
inviolable. Provincial and communal
franchises, the rights of the father
over his children, of the proprietor
over his possessions, of the testator
over his estate&mdash;all have been grasped
by the iron hand of the state. It
has broken all counterbalancing influences,
and those that it has not completely
annihilated only subsist during
its good pleasure.</p>

<p>How different is the theory of
power, regarded by the light of
Christian principle! Instituted for
the protection of rights and the repression
of injustice, it extends its
jurisdiction only by the means necessary
for attaining its end. As soon
as it would leave that sphere, it becomes
an usurper. Its power is limited
in every sense by divine law and
by the pre-existing rights of the subjects;
for, instead of the revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
theory that the state creates the
rights of private individuals, it is
Christian doctrine that the rights of
individuals incapable of defending
themselves rendered necessary the
creation of the state.</p>

<p>According to the first, society is
everything, the individual nothing;
according to the second, the individual
alone has immortal destinies, and
civil society is but a temporary means
to facilitate the accomplishment of
those destinies. The least of the
subjects has, then, the right to oppose
his conscience as a brazen wall against
the unjust will of a despot; and, if this
protestation is not heeded, another
voice will soon be heard which will
resound to the extremities of the universe&mdash;the
voice of the incorruptible
defender of justice, and the protector
of oppressed weakness; of him whom
God has placed on the earth to speak
in his name, to promulgate his law,
and to recall alike princes and people
to the respect of justice.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give further
proof of the doctrine we have endeavored
to explain. There is not one
of our readers who will not instantly
understand the principle whose restoration
we have declared indispensable
for putting an end to the fatal
reign of the Revolution. We were
not wrong in giving it the name of
principle, as from it flow all the laws
of political order, at the same time that
itself is immediately derived from the
very idea of that order. It is, then,
necessary, universal, and absolute; it
extends to all times, all forms of
government, all degrees of civilization.
At once political and religious, rational
and revealed, it belongs to
universal ethics, and is part of the
traditional dogma. He who denies
it will be condemned by the church
as a heretic, and will be disowned
by reason, as both a rebel against
evidence, and guilty of an attack
on the essential laws of social
order.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>If we have succeeded in demonstrating
this truth, it will not be
difficult to decide upon the duties it
imposes upon us, and the means we
must employ to incline in the way
of salvation the undecided balance
of the destinies of France.</p>

<p>Since the proclamation of the revolutionary
principle in the last
century was the commencement of
our ruin, we can only save ourselves
by denying it with all possible solemnity,
and in placing the contrary
principle as the basis of the future
constitution of our country. We
must, in fine, leave the ways which
have misled and lost all the powers
that during fifty years have assumed
in France the mission of restoring
public order. Undoubtedly, none
of them accepted the revolutionary
theory to its full extent; they even
by more than one act implied its
negation. But these isolated efforts,
extorted from them by the instinct
of preservation, did not prevent them
from habitually submitting to the influences
of the Revolution, and even
often rendering homage to its principles.</p>

<p>Sprung from its bosom, they dared
not deny their origin, and they did
not understand that, while shrinking
from this disavowal, they condemned
themselves to be overthrown by
the blind force which had lifted them
on its shield. One after the other
they deceived themselves, and France
with them, by taking “the great
principles of ‘89” as the palladium
of their thrones and their dynasties.
It was asking a guarantee of duration
from the most energetic dissolvent,
and giving a solemn falsehood to
France as a political creed. We
have shown elsewhere that, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
ambiguous formulas intended to deceive
thoughtless good faith, the
declaration of 1789 contains, in seventeen
articles, the pure theory of
the Revolution. We willingly admit
that this hypocrisy of language might,
at the first moment, put on the
wrong scent a generation intoxicated
with the desire of reform; but to be
still seduced by it, after so many
bloody revolutions have too clearly
commented this ambiguous text,
would be intolerable.</p>

<p>If we push blindness to this excess,
will we deserve to be called the most
intellectual people in the world?
We have been duped by a comedy
of fifteen years; will it be so with a
comedy of a hundred? It is thus
that posterity will name the century
in which the principles of ‘89 were
the theme of the most gigantic mystification
found in history. All the
civilized nations have been more or
less cheated by this jugglery of the
most precious liberties, in the name
of liberalism; but France has played
a separate part. It is she who, after
being herself deceived, endeavored
to make the entire universe share in
her deception, and thus took upon
herself both the shame of the fraud,
and the responsibility of the imposture.</p>

<p>Let us be done with this odious
falsehood, and return to reality.
Let us seek true liberties in the proclamation
of true principles, and
ensure respect for the rights of man
by the restoration of the authority
of God.</p>

<p>This is the first duty that the vital
interest of France imposes on all
men called to take any part whatever
in the re-establishment of power.</p>

<p>But henceforward we have another
obligation to fulfil. Honest men
of all parties must unite in the proclamation
of the Christian principle,
and renounce any alliance with the
defenders of the Revolution. Former
parties must disappear, and only
leave in the field the great armies of
order and disorder. This division
alone has a reason for existing in the
present state of society. Old parties,
on the contrary, can only be divided
by personal questions, to which it
would be shameful to attach any importance
in presence of the dangers
that menace society. All parties,
even those that seem to yield the
most thorough allegiance to the Revolution,
contain a greater or less
number of friends of order whose
equivocal connections do not prevent
their disowning, in the bottom of
their hearts, the revolutionary principle.</p>

<p>The moment has come to separate
these contrary elements united by
purely accidental affinities. We are
approaching one of those fatal dates
that betokens the end of one world,
and the commencement of another;
one of those partial judgments of
Providence that prelude the general
one by which divine justice will
close the era of time, to open that of
eternity. Now, as then, the terrible
blows of the Almighty dissipate illusions,
crush adverse interests, and
bring to light the two contrary tendencies
which have been hidden in
the depths of hearts; the two opposite
loves that, since the beginning
of the world, have divided humanity
into two hostile cities.</p>

<p>It is, then, indispensable to take a
side; the time of tergiversation and
compromise is past; we must be for
truth or falsehood, for order or the
Revolution, for Jesus Christ or the
infernal chief of all rebels. And it
does not suffice to carry the truth in
the heart: it must be professed openly
and courageously. The more
evident is the necessity of adhering
to the Christian principle, the more
manifest is the double obligation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
flows from it for honest men of all
parties to form a compact league,
whatever may have previously been
their mutual estrangement, and to
separate themselves from the revolutionists,
with whom circumstances
may have connected them.</p>

<p>We will go on no further, for we
have resolved not to leave the region
of principles; but the men to whom
Providence has given the mission
and power to save us cannot stop
there. They must bring down the
saving principle from the region of
abstractions to that of facts, give
it a concrete existence, a determined
form, a durable organization, a
strength sufficient to maintain itself,
and to raise us up. It is not our
province to guide them in the accomplishment
of this task; may God
give them, with the light which will
show them the path of salvation,
strength to follow it, and draw
France after them! They are called
to be nothing less than the saviours
of their country and of Christendom;
for it is not only the destinies of
France which they hold in their
hands, but those of Christian civilization,
incapable, if France yields, of
escaping from the invasion of the
double revolution of Cæsarism and
demagogism. May they feel the
gravity of the situation, and understand
that such great peril demands
heroic resolutions!</p>

<p>To worthily fulfil this mission, the
most important, perhaps, ever confided
to a deliberative assembly, they
must rise above all consideration of
persons, all interests of parties, and
they must choose, in the sincerity of
their conscience, the man and the
form of government that will most
surely guarantee the restoration of
the Christian principle, and the repudiation
of the revolutionary, the destruction
of anarchy and Cæsarism,
the protection of every right, and the
re-establishment of true liberty. This
choice, which alone can save us, will
not be difficult from the moment
that they agree on the principle from
which it must proceed, and the end
which must be attained; and once
the choice made under the eye of
God, it will be still less difficult, with
his help, to make it acceptable to
France.</p>

<p>The Comte de Breda recently recalled
to us, as appropriate to the
time, the consoling and prophetic
words written by Joseph de Maistre
in 1797, at an epoch when the restoration
of order appeared still more
difficult than at the present time:
“Can we believe that the political
world moves by chance, and that it
is not organized, directed, animated,
by the same wisdom which shines in
the physical? The great criminals
who overthrow a state necessarily
produce heart-rending wounds; but,
when man works to re-establish
order, he associates himself with the
Author of order, he is favored by nature&mdash;that
is to say, by the harmony
of secondary causes, which are the
ministers of divine power. His action
has something in it of divine; it
is at the same time gentle and imperious;
he forces nothing, and nothing
resists him.”</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE HOUSE OF YORKE.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="pc1">CRICHTON, AND THE CRICHTONIANS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> delicate exuberance of a New
England spring was making amends
for the rigor of a New England winter,
and for its own tardy coming.
Up through the faded sward pushed
multitudinously all the little budding
progeny of nature; out through rough
bark burst the tender foliage; and
all the green was golden-green.
Light winds blew hither and thither;
light clouds chased each other over
the sky, now and then massing their
forces to send a shower down, the
drops so entangled with sunshine as
to look like a rain of diamonds.
Birds soared joyously, singing as they
flew; and the channels of the brooks
could scarcely contain their frolicsome
streams. Sometimes a scattered
sisterhood of snowflakes came
down to see their ancestresses, and,
finding them changed into snowdrops,
immediately melted into an
ecstasy, and so exhaled.</p>

<p>This vernal freshness made the
beautiful city of Crichton fairer yet,
with curtains waving from open windows,
vines budding over the walls,
and all the many trees growing alive.
It set a fringe of grasses nodding
over the edges of three yellow paths
ravelled out from a new road that,
when it had travelled about a mile
westward from the city, gave up
being a road for the present. One
of these paths started off southward,
and sank into a swamp. In summer,
this swamp was as purple as a ripe
plum with flower-de-luce, and those
who loved nature well enough to
search for her treasures could find
there also an occasional cardinalflower,
a pink arethusa, or a pitcherblossom
full to the brim with the last
shower, or the last dew-fall. The
second path ran northward to the
bank of the Cocheco River, and broke
off on the top of a cliff. If you
should have nerve enough to scramble
down the face of this cliff, you
would find there the most romantic
little cave imaginable, moss-lined,
and furnished with moss cushions to
its rock divans. A wild cherry-tree
had in some way managed to find
footing just below the cave, and at this
season it would push up a spray of
bloom, in emulation of the watery
spray beneath. Fine green vines
threaded all the moss; and, if one of
them were lifted, it would show a line
of honey-sweet bell-flowers strung under
its round leaves.</p>

<p>The third path kept on westward
to a dusky tract of pine-woods about
two miles from the town. No newly-sprouting
verdure was visible amid
this sombre foliage; but there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
glistening through it all like the smile
on a dark face, and the neighboring
air was embalmed with its fine resinous
perfume.</p>

<p>Out from this wood came sounds
of laughter and many voices, some
shrill and childish, others deeper
voices of men, or softer voices of
women. Occasionally might be
heard a fitful song that broke off and
began again, only to break and begin
once more, as though the singer’s
hands were busy. Yet so dense was
the border of the wood with thick,
low-growing branches that, had you
gone even so near as to step on their
shadows, and slip on the smooth
hollows full of cones and needles
they had let fall, not a person would
you have seen.</p>

<p>A girlish voice burst out singing:</p>

<p class="ppn6sq p1">“‘The year’s at the spring,<br />
And day’s at the morn;<br />
Morning’s at seven;<br />
The hillside’s dew-pearled.<br />
The lark’s on the wing,<br />
The snail’s on the thorn;<br />
God’s in his heaven&mdash;<br />
All’s right with the world!’</p>

<p class="pn1">Only day is not at the morn,”
the voice added correctingly; “for
it is near sunset. But,” singing
again,</p>

<p class="ppn6sq p1">“‘The year’s at the spring;<br />
The lark’s on the wing;<br />
God’s in his heaven&mdash;<br />
And all’s right with the world!’</p>

<p class="pn1">&mdash;which may be called making a
posy out of a poem.”</p>

<p>A young man’s voice spoke: “All
will soon be wrong in a part of the
world, Pippa, if I do not call the
sheep to fold.” And immediately a
loud bugle-call sounded through the
forest, and died away in receding
echoes.</p>

<p>Presently a Maying-party came
trooping forth into sight.</p>

<p>First, stooping low under the
boughs, a score of boys and girls appeared,
their cheeks bright with exercise
and pure air, their silken hair
dishevelled. After them followed,
more sedately, a group of youths and
maidens, “Pippa,” otherwise Lily
Carthusen, and the bugler, among
them. All these young people were
decked with wreaths of ground pine
around their hats, waists, and arms,
and they carried hands full of Mayflowers.</p>

<p>Lastly, two gentlemen, one at
either hand, held back the branches,
and Miss Honora Pembroke stepped
from under the dark-green arch.</p>

<p>If you are a literal sort of person,
and make a point of calling things
by their everyday names, you would
have described her as a noble-looking
young woman, dressed in a graceful
brown gown, belted at the waist,
after a Grecian fashion, and some
sort of cloudy blue drapery that was
slipping from her head to her shoulders.
You would have said that her
hair was a yellowish brown that
looked bright in the sun, her eyes
about the same color, her features
very good, but not so classical in
shape as her robe. You might have
added that there was an expression
that, really&mdash;well, you did not know
just how to name it, but you should
judge that the young woman was
romantic, though not without sense.
If you should have guessed her age
to be twenty-eight, you would have
been right.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you are poetically
Christian, ever crowning with
the golden thorns of sacrifice whatever
is most beautiful on earth, you
would have liked to take the Mayflower
wreath from this womanly
maiden’s hand, place the palm-branch
in its stead, and so send her
to heaven by the way of the lions.
Her face need hardly have changed
to go that road, so lofty and delicate
was the joy that shone under her
quiet exterior, so full of light the eyes
that, looking straight before her into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
space, seemed to behold all the glory
of the skies.</p>

<p>The girl who came next was very
different, not at all likely to suggest
poetical fancies, though when you
looked closely you could see much
fineness of outline in the features and
form. But she was spoilt in the
coloring&mdash;a sallow skin, “sandy”
hair, and light eyes giving a dingy
look to her face. She was spoilt still
more by the expression, which was
superficial, and by being overdressed
for her size and the occasion, and a
little ragged from the bushes. This is
Miss, or, as she likes to be called, Mademoiselle,
Annette Ferrier. If at
some moment, unawares, you should
take the liberty to call her Niñon, with
an emphatic nasal, she would forgive
you beamingly, and consider you a
very charming person. Mademoiselle,
who, like three generations of
her ancestors, was born in America,
and who had spent but three months
of her life in France, had no greater
ambition than to be taken for a
French lady. But do not set her
down as a simpleton. Her follies
are not malicious, and may wear off.
Have you never seen the young
birds, when they are learning to fly,
how clumsily they tumble about?
yet afterward they cleave the air like
arrows with their strong pointed
wings. And have you not seen
some bud, pushing out at first in a
dull, rude sheath that mars the beauty
of the plant, open at last to disclose
petals of such rare beauty that
the sole glory of the plant was in upbearing
it? Some souls have to work
off a good deal of clinging foolishness
before they come to themselves.
Therefore, let us not classify Miss
Ferrier just yet.</p>

<p>She had scarcely appeared, when
one branch was released with a discourteous
haste that sent it against
her dress, and a gentleman quickly
followed her, and, with a somewhat
impatient air, took his place at her
side. Mr. Lawrence Gerald had
that style of beauty which suggests
the pedestal&mdash;an opaque whiteness of
tint as pure as the petal of a camellia,
clustering locks of dark hair,
and an exquisite perfection of form
and feature. He and Miss Ferrier
were engaged to be married, which
was some excuse for the profuse
smiles and blushes she expended on
him, and which he received with the
utmost composure.</p>

<p>The second branch swung softly
back from the hand that carefully released
it, and Mr. Max Schöninger
came into sight, brushing the brown
pine-scales from his gloves. He was
the last in order, but not least in
consequence, of the party, as more
than one backward glance that
watched for his appearance testified.
This was a tall, fair-haired German,
with powerful shoulders, and strong
arms that sloped to the finest of sensitive
hands. He had a grave countenance,
which sometimes lit up
beautifully with animated expression,
and sometimes also veiled itself in a
singular manner. Let anything be
said that excited his instinct of reserve
or self-defence, and he could
at once banish all expression from
his face. The broad lids would droop
over those changeful eyes of his, and
one saw only a blank where the moment
before had shone a cordial and
vivid soul.</p>

<p>When we say that Mr. Schöninger
was a Jew who had all his life been
associated more with Christians than
with his own people, this guarded
manner will not seem unnatural.
He glanced over the company, and
was hesitatingly about to join Miss
Pembroke, when one of the children
left her playmates, and ran to take
his hand. Mr. Schöninger was never
on his guard with children, and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
he petted were devotedly fond of
him. He smiled in the upturned
face of this little girl, held the small
hand closely, and led her on.</p>

<p>The order of march changed as
the party advanced. Those who had
been last to leave the wood were
made to take precedence; the youths
and maidens dropped behind them,
and, as both walked slowly forward,
the younger ones played about them,
now here, now there. It was like an
air with variations.</p>

<p>The elders of the company were
very quiet, Miss Carthusen a little
annoyed. She need not have wasted
her eloquence in persuading Mr.
Schöninger to come with them, if he
was going to devote himself to that
baby. Miss Carthusen was clever,
and rather pretty, and she liked to
talk. What was the use of having
ideas and fancies, if one was not to
express them? Why should one go
into company, if one was to remain
silent? She considered Mr. Schöninger
too superb by half.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and it flooded
all the scene with a light so rich as to
seem tangible. Whatever it fell upon
was not merely illuminated, it was gilded.
The sky was hazy with that radiance,
the many windows on the twin
hills of Crichton blazed like beacons,
and the short green turf glistened with
a yellow lustre. Those level rays
threw the long shadows of the flower-bearers
before them as they walked,
dazzled the faces turned sidewise to
speak, turned the green wreaths on
their heads into golden wreaths, and
sparkled in their hair. When Miss
Pembroke put her hand up to shade
her eyes in looking backward, the
ungloved fingers shone as if transparent.
She had been drinking in the
beauty of the evening till it was all
ready to burst from her lips, and
there seemed to be no one who perceived
that beauty but herself. She
would have liked to be alone, with
no human witness, and to give vent
to the delight that was tingling
in her veins. A strong impulse was
working in her to lift a fold of
her dress at either side, slide out that
pretty foot of hers now hidden under
the hem, and go floating round in a
dance, advancing as she turned, like
a planet in its path. It would have
been a relief could she have sung at
the very top of her voice. She had
looked backward involuntarily at
Mr. Schöninger, expecting some sympathy
from him; but, seeing him engrossed
in his little charge, had dropped
her hand, and walked on, feeling
rather disappointed. “I supposed
he believed in the creation, at least,”
she thought.</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke was usually a very
dignified and quiet young woman,
who said what she meant, who never
effervesced on small occasions, and
sometimes found herself unmoved on
occasions which many considered
great ones. But when, now and then,
the real afflatus came, it was hard to
have her lips sealed and her limbs
shackled.</p>

<p>As she dropped her hand, faintly
and fairylike in the distance she
heard all the bells of Crichton ringing
for sunset.</p>

<p><i>Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus</i>, she sang
softly, clasping her hands, still walking
forward; and so went on with
the rest of the hymn, not minding
where the others of the party were,
or if there were any others, till she
felt a little pull at her dress, and became
aware that Mr. Schöninger’s
young friend had urged him forward
to hear the singing, and was holding
up her hand to the singer. But the
Jew’s visor was down.</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke took the child’s
hand, which thus formed a link between
the two, and continued her
singing: <i>Benedictus qui venit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
nomini Domini</i>. She felt almost as
if the man, thus linked to her by that
transparent, innocent nature of the
little girl between them, were spiritually
joining her in the Hosanna.
How deep or bitter his prejudices
might be she knew not. Their acquaintance
had been short, and they
had never spoken of their theological
differences. That his unbelief could
be profound, yet gentle and tolerant
toward her belief, had never occurred
to her mind. She would have been
scarcely more shocked than astonished
could she have known the thought
that almost escaped his lips. “She
is too noble to be a worshipper of
strange gods,” he thought. “When
will this miserable delusion be swept
away!”</p>

<p>A slim, light hand stole into Miss
Pembroke’s arm on the other side,
and Miss Carthusen’s cheek pressed
close to her shoulder. Miss Carthusen
was a foundling, and had been
adopted by a wealthy and childless
couple. Nothing whatever was
known of her parentage.</p>

<p>“Lady Honora,” she whispered,
“this scene reminds me of something.
I am like Mignon, with my recollections
gathering fast into a picture;
only my past is further away than
hers was. I almost know who I am,
and where I came from. It flashes
back now. We were dancing on the
green, a ring of us. It was not in
this land. The air was warm, the
sward like rose-leaves; there were
palms and temples not far away. I
had this hand stretched forward to
one who held it, and the other backward
to one who held it, and so we
danced, and there were wreaths on
our heads, vine-leaves tangled in our
hair. Suddenly something swept
over and through us, like a cold
wind, or a sharp cry, or both, and we
all became fixed in a breath, the smile,
the wreath, the tiptoe foot, and we
hardened and grew less, and the air
inside the ring died with our breaths
in it, and the joy froze out of us, and
the recollection of all we were faded.
We were like flames that have gone
out. There was nothing left but an
antique vase with Bacchantes dancing
round it in a petrified circle. Have
you ever seen such a vase, with one
figure missing?”</p>

<p>“Silly child!” said Honora, smiling,
but shrinking a little. This girl was
too clinging, her imagination too
pagan. “It is said that, at the birth
of Christ, that wail was heard through
all the hosts of pagan demons. ‘Pan
is dead!’ they cried, and fled like
dry leaves before a November wind.
Pan is dead, Lily Carthusen; and if
you would kindle his altars again,
you must go down into the depths
of perdition for the spark.”</p>

<p>She spoke with seriousness, even
with energy, and a light blush fluttered
into her cheeks, and faded out again.</p>

<p>Miss Carthusen, still clinging to
the arm she had clasped, leaned forward
to cast a laughing glance into
the face beyond. “To Mr. Schöninger,”
she said, “we are both talking
mythology.”</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke freed her arm decidedly,
and stepped backward, so as
to bring herself between Miss Ferrier
and Lawrence Gerald. She took an
arm of each, and held them a
moment as if she were afraid. “Annette,
Lily Carthusen must not help
us to trim the altar,” she said. “It
is not fitting. We will do it ourselves,
with Mother Chevreuse.”</p>

<p>“But Lily has such taste,” was the
reluctant answer. “And she may
be displeased if we do not ask her.”</p>

<p>“Our Lady thinks more of devotion
than of taste, Annette,” Miss Pembroke
said earnestly. “It seems to
me that every flower ought to be
placed there by the hand of faith and
love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>The other yielded. People always
did yield when Miss Pembroke
urged. And Miss Carthusen, fortunately,
saved them the embarrassment
of declining her assistance by walking
on, engrossed in a gay conversation
with the German. When she recollected,
they were already far apart.
She and her companion were close
to the town, and the others had
stopped where the three paths met.</p>

<p>The children gathered about Miss
Ferrier, and began piling their Mayflowers
and green wreaths into her
arms; for the flowers were all to decorate
the altar of Mary in the beautiful
church of S. John the Evangelist.
These children were not half
of them Catholic; but that made
no difference in Crichton, where the
people prided themselves on being
liberal. Moreover, Miss Ferrier was
a person of influence, and could reward
those who obliged her.</p>

<p>Then they scattered, dropping into
different roads, one by one, and two
by two, till only three, heavily laden
with their fragrant spoil, were left
walking slowly up South Avenue,
into which the unfinished road expanded
when it reached the city.
They were to take tea at Mrs. Ferrier’s,
and afterward go to the church;
for this was the last day of a warm
and forward April, and on the next
morning the exercises of the Month
of Mary were to begin. At the most
commanding spot on the crown of
the hill stood Mrs. Ferrier’s house;
and one has but to glance at it to
understand at once why mademoiselle
is a person of influence.</p>

<p>Seventeen years before, those who
knew them would have imagined
almost any change of fortune sooner
than that the Ferriers should become
people of wealth. There was Mr.
Ferrier, a stout, dull, uneducated,
hard-working man, who had not talent
nor ambition enough to learn
any trade, but passed his life in
drudging for any one who would
give him a day’s work. A man of
obtuse intelligence, and utterly uncultivated
tastes, but for the spark of
faith left in that poor soul of his, he
would have been a clod. But there
the spark was, like a lamp in a tomb,
showing, with its faint but steady
light, the wreck of the beautiful, and
the noble, and the sublime that was
man as God made him; showing the
dust of lost powers and possibilities,
and the dust of much accumulated
dishonor; showing the crumbling
skeleton of a purpose that had started
perfect; and showing also, carven
deep, but dimly seen, the word of
hope, <i>Resurgam!</i></p>

<p>Those human problems meet us
often, staggering under the primal
curse, ground down to pitiless labor
from the cradle to the grave, losing
in their sordid lives, little by little,
first, the strength and courage to
look abroad, then the wish, and, at
last, the power, the soul in them shining
with only an occasional flicker
through the <i>débris</i> of their degraded
natures. But if faith be there buried
with the soul in that earthy darkness,
the word of hope is still for them
<i>Resurgam!</i></p>

<p>There was Mrs. Ferrier, a very different
sort of person, healthy, thrifty,
cheerful, with a narrow vein of stubborn
good sense that was excellent
as far as it went, and with a kind
heart and a warm temper. The
chief fault in her was a common
fault: she wished to shape and measure
the world by her own compasses;
and, since those were noticeably
small, the impertinence was very
apparent. She was religiously obedient
to her husband when he raised
his fist; but, in most matters, she ruled
the household, Mr. Ferrier being authoritative
only on the subject of his
three meals, his pipe and beer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
his occasional drop of something
stronger.</p>

<p>And there were five or six young
ones, new little souls in very soiled
bodies, the doors of life still open for
them, their eyes open also to see, and
their wills free to choose. These
little ones, happy in their rags, baked
mud pies, squabbled and made up
twenty times a day, ate and slept
like the healthy animals they were,
their greatest trial being when their
faces were washed and their hair
combed, on which occasion there
was an uproar in the family. These
occasions were not frequent.</p>

<p>The Ferrier mansion had but one
room, and the Ferrier plenishing was
simple. The wardrobe also was simple.
For state days, monsieur had
a state costume, the salient points of
which were an ample white waistcoat
and an ancient and well-preserved
silk hat which he wore very far
back on his head, both these articles
being part of his wedding gear. Madame
had also her gala attire, with
which she always assumed an expression
of complacent solemnity. This
toilet was composed of a dark-red
merino gown, a dingy <i>broché</i> shawl,
and a large straw bonnet, most unconsciously
Pompadour, with its pink
flowers and blue ribbons. For great
occasions, the children had shoes,
bought much too large that they
might not be outgrown; and they
had hats nearly as old as themselves.
The girls had flannel gowns that
hung decently to their heels; the
boys, less careful of their finery, had
to go very much patched.</p>

<p>On Sundays and holidays, they all
walked two miles to hear Mass, and
each one put a penny into the box.
On Christmas Days, they each gave
a silver quarter, the father distributing
the coin just before the collector
reached them, all blushing with
pride and pleasure as they made their
offering, and smiling for some time
after, the children nudging and whispering
to each other till they had to
be set to rights by their elders.
Contented souls, how simple and
harmless they were!</p>

<p>Into the midst of this almost unconscious
poverty, wealth dropped
like a bombshell. If the sea of oil
under their cabin and pasture had
suddenly exploded and blown them
sky-high, they could not have been
more astounded; for oil there was,
and floods of it. At almost any part
of the little tract of land they had
bought for next to nothing, it was
but to dig a hole, and liquid gold
bubbled up by the barrelful.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferrier, poor man! was like a
great clumsy beetle that blunders out
of the familiar darkness of night into
a brilliantly lighted room. Perhaps
something aspiring and only half
dead in him cried out through his
dulness with a voice he could not
comprehend; perhaps the sudden
brightness put out what little sight
he had: who knows? He drank.
He was in a dream; and he drank
again. The dream became a nightmare;
and still he drank&mdash;drank
desperately&mdash;till at last nature gave
way under the strain, and there came
to him an hour of such utter silence
as he had not known since he lay,
an infant, in his mother’s lap. During
that silence, light broke in at
last, and the imprisoned light shone
out with a strange and bewildered
surprise. The priest, that visible
angel of God, was by his side, instructing
his ignorance, calming his
fears, calling up in his awakening
soul the saving contrition, leaving
him only when the last breath had
gone.</p>

<p>After the husband went child
after child, till but two were left,
Annette and Louis. These, the eldest,
the mother saved alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>We laugh at the preposterous extravagance
and display of the newly
enriched. But is there not something
pitiful in it, after all? How
it tells of wants long denied, of common
pleasures that were so distant
from those hopeless eyes as to look
like shining stars! They flutter and
run foolishly about, those suddenly
prosperous ones, like birds released
from the cage, like insects when the
stone is lifted from them; but those
who have always been free to practise
their smooth flight through a
sunny space, or to crawl at ease over
the fruits of the world, would do well
not to scorn them.</p>

<p>The house Mrs. Ferrier had built
for herself in the newest and finest
avenue of Crichton was, it must be
confessed, too highly ornamented.
Ultra-Corinthian columns; cornerstones
piled to the very roof at each
angle, and so laboriously vermiculated
that they gave one an impression
of wriggling; cornices laden with
carving, festoons, fancy finials wherever
they could perch; oriels, baywindows,
arched windows with carven
faces over them&mdash;all these fretted
the sight. But the view from the
place was superb.</p>

<p>When our three flower-bearers
reached the gate, they turned to contemplate
the scene.</p>

<p>All round, a circle of purple hills
stood bathed in the sunset. From
these hills the Crichtonians had borrowed
the graceful Athenian title,
and called their fair city the “city
of the violet crown.” Forming their
eastern boundary flowed the stately
Saranac, that had but lately carried
its last float of ice out to sea, almost
carrying a bridge with it. Swollen
with dissolving snows, it glided past,
a moving mirror, nearly to the tops
of the wharves. Northward was the
Cocheco, an untamed little river
born and brought up amid crags and
rocks. It cleft the city in twain, to
cast itself headlong into the Saranac,
a line of bubbles showing its course
for half a mile down the smoother
tide.</p>

<p>The Cocheco was in high feather
this spring, having succeeded at last
in dislodging an unsightly mill that
had been built at one of its most picturesque
turns. Let trade go up the
Saranac, and bind its gentler waters
to grind wheat and corn, and saw
logs, and act as sewer; the Cocheco
reserved itself for the beautiful and
the contemplative. It liked that
lovers should walk the winding roads
along its banks; that children should
come at intervals, wondering, half
afraid, as if in fairy-land; that troubled
souls, longing for solitude,
should find it in some almost inaccessible
nook among its crags; but,
best of all, it liked that some child
of grace, divinely gifted to see everything
in God, should walk rejoicingly
by its side. “O my God! how
sweet are those little thoughts of
thine, the violets! How thy songs
flow down the waters, and roll out
from the clouds! How tender is the
shadow of thy hand when at night it
presses our heavy eyelids down,
and folds us to sleep in thy bosom,
or when it wakens us silently to commune
with thee!” For such a soul,
the river had an articulate voice, and
answered song for song.</p>

<p>Yes; that was what it had to do in
the world. Away with mills and
traffic! Let trade go up the Saranac.</p>

<p>So for three years watery tongues
had licked persistently at posts and
timbers, legions of bubbles had snapped
at splinters till they wore away,
and the whole river had gathered
and flung itself against the foundations,
till at last, when the spring
thaw came, over went the mill, and
was spun down stream, and flung
into the deeper tide, and so swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
out to sea. Let trade go up the
Saranac!</p>

<p>But the patient Saranac sawed the
logs, and carried away their dust and
refuse, and took all the little fretted
brooks and rivers into its bosom, and
soothed their murmurs there. And
both did God’s will, and both were
good.</p>

<p>Half hidden by the steep slope of
the hill, as one stood in Mrs. Ferrier’s
porch, was the church of S.
John the Evangelist. Only the unfinished
tower of it was visible, and a
long line of slated roof seen in glimpses
between spires and chimneys.</p>

<p>“I really believe, Lawrence, that
Crichton is the pleasantest place in
the world,” remarked Miss Pembroke,
after a short silence.</p>

<p>A servant had taken away their
flowers to keep fresh for the evening,
and Miss Ferrier had gone in to
change her dress. The mother being
away, there was no need the
other two should enter, when the
lovely evening invited them to remain
outside.</p>

<p>Receiving no reply, the lady glanced
inquiringly at her companion,
and saw that his silence was a dissenting
one. He had thrown himself
into a chair, tossed his hat aside,
and was looking off into the distance
with fixed and gloomy eyes. The
tumbled locks of hair fell over half
his forehead, his attitude expressed
discontent and depression, and there
was a look about the mouth that
showed his silence might proceed
only from the suppression of a reply
too bitter or too rude to utter.</p>

<p>Seeing that her glance might force
him to speak, she anticipated him,
and continued, in a gentle, soothing
tone: “If one loves religion, here is
a beautiful church, and the best of
priests; if one is intellectual, here is
every advantage&mdash;books, lectures,
and a cultivated society; if one is a
lover of nature, where can be found a
more beautiful country? Oh! it is
not Switzerland nor Italy, I know;
but it is delightful, for all that.”</p>

<p>She had spoken carefully, like one
feeling her way, and here she hesitated
just for a breath, as though not
sure whether she had better go on,
but went on nevertheless. “Here
every one is known, and his position
secure. He need not suffer in public
esteem from adverse circumstances,
if they do not affect his character.
There never was a place, I
think, where a truly courageous and
manly act would be more heartily
applauded.”</p>

<p>“Ah! yes,” the young man said,
with hasty scorn; “they applaud
while the thing is new, and then forget
all about it. They like novelty.
I don’t doubt that all the people
would clap their hands if I should
take to sweeping the streets, and
that for a week the young ladies
would tie bouquets to the end of the
broomstick. But after the week was
over, what then? They would find
me a dusty fellow whose acquaintance
they would gradually drop.
Besides, their applause is not all. I
might not enjoy street-sweeping, even
though I and my broomstick were
crowned with flowers as long as we
lasted.”</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke had blushed slightly
at this sudden and violent interpretation
of her hidden meaning; but
she answered quietly: “No: their applause
is not all&mdash;the applause of the
world is never all, but it helps sometimes;
and, if they give it to us for
one moment when we start on the
right path, it is all that we ought to
expect. Life is not a theatre with a
few actors and a great circle of spectators:
we all have our part to play,
and cannot stop long to admire
others.”</p>

<p>“Especially when that other is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
only the scene-shifter,” laughed the
young man, throwing the hair back
from his face.</p>

<p>“I know well that ordinary, inelegant
work would come very hard to
you, Lawrence,” she said kindly;
“and, if it were to be continued to
the end of your life, I might think it
too hard. But there must be ways,
for other men have found them, of
beginning at the lower end of the
ladder, even very low down, even in
the dust, and climbing steadily to a
height that would satisfy the climber’s
ambition. It needs only a strong
will and perseverance; and I firmly
believe, Lawrence, that, to a strong
will, almost anything is possible.”</p>

<p>“A strong will is a special gift,”
he replied stubbornly.</p>

<p>“Yes; and one for which we may
ask,” she said; then, seeing that he
frowned, added: “And for you I
like Crichton, as I said. One is
known here, and motives and circumstances
are understood. A thousand
little helps might be given
which in a strange city you would
not have. All would be seen and
understood here.”</p>

<p>“All would be seen, yes!” he exclaimed,
with a shrug and a frown.
“That is the trouble. One would
rather hide something.”</p>

<p>She would not be repelled.
“There is, of course, sometimes a
disadvantage in living where everything
is known,” she admitted.
“But there must be disadvantages
everywhere in the world. Look at
the bright side of it. If you were in
a great city, where all sorts of crimes
hide, where men the most abandoned
in reality can for a long time maintain
a fair reputation before the
world, how your difficulties would be
increased! You would not then
know whom to trust. Here, on the
contrary, no wrong can remain long
hidden.”</p>

<p>He had not looked at her before,
but at these words his eyes flashed
into her face a startled glance. Her
eyes were looking thoughtfully over
the town.</p>

<p>Feeling his gaze, she turned towards
him with a quick change of
expression and manner. A friendly
and coaxing, almost caressing, raillery
took the place of her seriousness:
“Come! drive away your blues,
Lawrence, and take courage. Study
out some course for yourself where
you can see far ahead, and then start
and follow it, though you should find
obstacles grow up in the way. Bore
through them, or climb over them.
There must be a way. There is
something in you for honor, something
better than complaining.
Cheer up!”</p>

<p>She extended her hand to him impulsively.</p>

<p>“What motive have I?” he asked.
But his face had softened, and a faint
smile showed that the cloud had a
silver lining.</p>

<p>“For your mother’s sake,” she
said. “How happy she would be!”</p>

<p>“I can make my mother happy
by kissing her, and telling her she is
an angel,” he answered.</p>

<p>It was but too true.</p>

<p>“For poor Annette, then. There
is a good deal in her, and she is devoted
to you.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and
lifted his eyebrows: “She loves me
as I am, and would love me if I were
ten times as worthless, poor silly girl!”</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke withdrew her
hand, and retired a step from him.
Again he had spoken the truth, this
spoiled favorite of women!</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, then.”</p>

<p>He did not dare give another
shrug, for his mentor’s face was losing
its kindness. “You know I am
not at all pious, Honora,” he said,
dropping his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>She still retained her patience:
“Can you find no motive in yourself,
Lawrence? Do you feel no necessity
for action, for courageous trial
of what life may hold for you?”</p>

<p>His pale face grew bright with an
eager light. “If life but held for
me one boon! O Honora....”</p>

<p>She made a quick, silencing gesture,
and a glance, inconceivably
haughty and scornful, shot from her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you two people quarrelling?”
Miss Ferrier inquired, behind them.
“If you are, I am in good time. Tea
is ready, and I suppose the sooner
we are off, the better.”</p>

<p>“I sent the flowers to the church,”
she continued, as they went in through
the gorgeous hall, “and directed
John to tell Mother Chevreuse that
we should come down in about an
hour. But he brings me word that
she is out with some sick woman, and
may not come home till quite late. So
we are but three.”</p>

<p>Mother Chevreuse was the priest’s
mother. It had grown to be a custom
to give her that title, partly out
of love for both mother and son,
partly because Father Chevreuse himself
sometimes called her so.</p>

<p>“It will require one person to carry
your train, Annette,” Mr. Gerald said,
looking at the length of rustling
brown silk over which he had twice
stumbled. “And that takes two out;
for, of course, you can do nothing in
that dress. Honora will have the
pleasure of decorating the altar, while
we look on.”</p>

<p>Only the faintest shade of mortification
passed momentarily over the
girl’s face, and vanished. She knew
well the power her wealth had with
this man, and that she could not
make it too evident. Miss Ferrier
was frivolous and extravagant, but
she was not without discernment.</p>

<p>“Did you ever know me to fail
when I attempted anything?” she
asked, with a little mingling of defiance
and triumph in her air. “Honora
goes calmly and steadily to work;
but when I begin....”</p>

<p>She stopped, embarrassed, for a
rude speech had been at her lips.</p>

<p>“You do twice as much as I,”
Miss Pembroke finished, with sweet
cordiality. “It is true, Annette,
though you did not like to say it.
You have great energy.”</p>

<p>She put her hand out, and touched
caressingly the shoulder of her young
hostess in passing. “You are just
what Lawrence needs.”</p>

<p>Tears of pleasure filled Annette’s
eyes. For all her wealth and the
flatteries it had brought her, she had
seldom heard a word of earnest commendation.</p>

<p>To be praised by Honora was
sweet; but to be praised before
Lawrence was sweetest of all.</p>

<p>They hurried through their tea,
and went to the church. Mother
Chevreuse had not returned home,
and the priest also was away. The
pleasant task of adorning the altar of
Our Lady was left to them.</p>

<p>The stars were beginning to show
faintly in the sky when they commenced
their work, and all the church
was full of that clear yellow twilight.
The pillars and walls, snowy white,
with only delicate bands of gilding,
reflected the softened beams, and
seemed to grow transparent in them.
But around the side-altar burned a
ring of brilliant gas-jets; and through
the open door of the sacristy was
visible, ruddily lighted, a long passage
and stairway leading to the basement.</p>

<p>The light of heaven and the light
of earth were thus brought face to
face&mdash;the one pure, tender, and pervading,
the other flaring, thick, and
partial. But as daylight faded away,
that inner light brought out strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
effects. There was no longer anything
white in the church: it was all
turned to rose-color and deep shadow.
Carven faces looked down
with seeing eyes from arch, capital,
and cornice; the pillars, standing up
and down in long rows, appeared to
lean together, to move, and change
places with each other; there was a
tremor in the dimly-seen organ-pipes,
as though the strong breath of music
were passing through them, and would
presently break out in loud accord.
A picture of S. John beside the grand
altar showed nothing but the face,
and the face was as glowing as if it
had just been lifted from the bosom
of the Lord to look into the Lord’s
eyes.</p>

<p>One might fancy that this fair
temple in which God had taken up
his dwelling only waited for those
three to go away, that it might break
into joy and adoration over its divine
Guest.</p>

<p>On a pedestal at the gospel side
of the altar stood the statue of Our
Lady, lovely eyelids downcast, as she
gazed on those below, loving hands
and arms outstretched, inviting all
the world to her motherly embrace.
An arch of white lilies had already
been put up against a larger arch of
green that was to be set with candles
and a crown of light. They were
now engaged in putting under the
lilies a third and smaller arch of
Mayflowers, that the whole might be
like the Lady it was meant to honor&mdash;radiant
with glory, mantled in purity,
and full of tender sweetness.</p>

<p>Annette had redeemed her promise
of usefulness. Her long train was
pinned about her, leaving a white
skirt with the hem close to her ankles,
and the flowing drapery of her sleeves
was bound above the elbow, her arms
being quite free. Mounted on the
topmost step of an unsteady ladder,
she fastened the higher flowers; lower
down, at either side, Lawrence Gerald
and Honora tied the lower ones.
Not much was said, the few necessary
words were lowly spoken; but they
smiled now and then in each other’s
lighted faces.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock when they went
out through the basement, leaving a
man to extinguish the gas and lock
the door. On their way to the street,
they passed the priest’s house. Only
one light was visible in it, and that
shone in a wide-open stairway window.
The light, with a shadow beside
it, was approaching the window,
and presently a man’s head and
shoulders appeared above the high
sill. Father Chevreuse had returned
home, and was going up to his chamber.
He stopped, holding a candle,
and put out his right hand to close
the window, but paused, hearing a
step outside. “Who’s there?” he
asked authoritatively, peering out,
but seeing nothing in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Three friends who are just going
home,” answered a voice.</p>

<p>“And who are the other two,
Honora Pembroke?” demanded the
priest.</p>

<p>“Annette and Lawrence. We have
been arranging flowers for Our Lady.”</p>

<p>“That’s well. Good-night!”</p>

<p>He pulled the sash down with a
bang; but Honora, smiling in the
dark, still held her companions beneath
the window. It opened again
with another bang.</p>

<p>“Children!” he called out.</p>

<p>“Yes, father!”</p>

<p>“God bless you! Good-night!”</p>

<p>Again the sash came down, more
gently this time, and the light and
the kind heart went on climbing up
the stairway.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t have slept well to-night
if he had not said ‘God bless
you!’ to us,” said Miss Pembroke.
“And I believe we shall sleep better
for it, too, God bless him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked up the steep hillside
from the lower part of the town toward
South Avenue. Half-way up
the hill, on a cross-street that led out
toward the country, was the cottage
in which Lawrence Gerald lived with
his mother, his aunt, and Honora
Pembroke. As they approached
this road, Annette Ferrier’s heart
fluttered. Lawrence had been very
amiable that evening. He had
praised her, had twice smiled very
kindly, and had put her shawl over
her shoulders before they came out,
as though he were really afraid she
might take cold. Perhaps he would
leave Honora at home first, and then
go up with her.</p>

<p>What great good this would do
her she could not have explained;
for seldom had she heard from him
a word too tender to be spoken before
witnesses. Still, she wished it.
He might say something kind, or listen
willingly to some word of affection
from her. At any rate, she
would be a little longer in his company.</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke anticipated her
wish, or had some other reason for
making the proposal. “Just go as far
as the gate with me, and then you
can escort Annette,” she said. “You
will not mind a few extra steps, Annette?”</p>

<p>“Oh! come up with us,” the
young man interposed hastily. “It
is a beautiful night for walking, and
I know you are not tired yet. You
can bear twice the walking that Annette
can.”</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, then went
on with them. His request displeased
her on more than one account:
she did not like his indifference
to the company of his promised
wife, and she did not like his
preference for being with herself.
But his mother would be anxiously
watching for him; and it would be
something if he could be lured in at
an early hour after a quiet evening.</p>

<p>Down in the black heart of the
town, among the offices, was a certain
back room where the windows
were not so closely curtained but
those who watched outside could
see a thread of light burning all
night long. To this room men went
sometimes in the hope of mending
their fortunes, or, after the demon
of gambling had caught them fast, to
taste of that fiery excitement which
had now become to them a necessity.
Honora more than suspected that
Lawrence Gerald’s steps had sometimes
turned in there. A year or
two before, in one of his good
moods, he had confessed it to her,
with an almost boyish contrition, and
had promised never to go again. It
was his last confession of the sort,
but, she feared, not his last sin. Of
what worth were the promises of
a weak, tempted man who never
sought earnestly the help of God to
strengthen his resolution? Of no
more value than an anchor without
a cable. Lawrence needed to be
watched and cared for; so she went
on with them.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry to trouble you
both,” Miss Ferrier exclaimed, in a
voice trembling with anger and disappointment.
“I could have had
John come for me, if I had thought.”
She snatched her hand from the arm
of her escort, and pulled her shawl
about her with nervous twitches.</p>

<p>“It would have been better to
have had John,” Honora said; “for
he could have gone home with me.
I am the troublesome third, as it is.
But then,” speaking lightly, “if I am
the last, Lawrence will be obliged to
go in early.”</p>

<p>With another twitch of her shawl,
Annette took her escort’s arm again
as abruptly as she had left it, and,
held it closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Careless as the last words had
sounded, she knew their meaning,
for there had been something said on
this subject before. She chose to
take it defiantly now, and it comforted
her to do so. Others might
blame and doubt him, but she would
not. He seemed nearer to her in
the light of her superior devotedness
than to any one else. She would
never fail him; and by-and-by he
would know her worth. The glow
of this fervent hope warmed the girl’s
chilled heart, and gave her a sort of
happiness.</p>

<p>And so they reached the house, and,
after a quiet good-night, separated.</p>

<p>The walk back was passed in silence;
and Miss Pembroke did not
choose to lean on her companion’s
arm; she wished to hold her dress
out of the dust.</p>

<p>The street they went through was
one of those delightful old ones
which a city sometimes leaves untouched
for a long time. Over-arching
elms grew thickly on either
side, and the houses were all detached.</p>

<p>Midway up this street stood the
cottage of the Geralds, with a garden
in front and at the back, and a narrow
green at right and left. Three
long windows in front, lighting the
parlor, reached almost to the ground.
The steep roof slanted to a veranda
at each side, leaving but one upper
window over the three&mdash;a wide window
with casements swinging back
from the middle. The cottage was
in the shape of a cross, and at one
arm of it a lighted window shone out
on the veranda.</p>

<p>At sound of the gate-latch, the
curtain was drawn aside a little, and
a woman looked out an instant, then
hastened to open the door.</p>

<p>“Are we late, Mrs. Gerald?”
Honora asked, and stepped forward
into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Oh! no, dear; I did not expect
you any sooner.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald lingered in the doorway,
looking back at her son as he
stopped to leave his hat and overcoat
in the entry, and only entered
the sitting-room when she had
caught a glimpse of his face as he
came toward her. He was looking
pleasant, she saw, and was contented
with that.</p>

<p>“Well, mother!” he said, and
sank indolently into the arm-chair she
pushed before the open fire for him.
It was the only arm-chair in the
room.</p>

<p>She drew another chair forward,
and seated herself beside him. Honora,
sitting on a low stool in the
corner, with the firelight shining over
her, told what they had been doing
that afternoon and evening. The
son listened, his eyes fixed on the
fire; the mother listened, her eyes
fixed on her son.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald was an Irish lady of
good descent, well educated, and
well mannered, and had seen better
days. We do not call them better
days because in her girlhood and
early married life this lady had been
wealthy, but because she had been
the happy daughter of excellent parents,
and the happy wife of a good
man. All were gone now but this
son; the husband dead for many a
year, the daughters married and far
away, the wealth melted from her
like sunset gold from a cloud; but
Lawrence was left, and he filled her
heart.</p>

<p>One could read this in her face as
she watched him. It revealed the
pride of the mother in that beautiful
manhood which she had given to the
world, and which was hers by an inalienable
right that no one could
usurp; and it revealed, too, the entire
self-forgetfulness of the woman who
lives only in the life so dear to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
The face showed more yet; for,
hovering over this love and devotion
as the mist of the coming storm surrounds
the full moon, and rings its
softened brightness with a tremulous
halo, one could detect even in the
mother’s smile the mist of a foreboding
sadness.</p>

<p>How ineffable and without hope is
that sadness which is ever the companion
of a too exclusive affection!</p>

<p>Honora Pembroke looked at the
two, and pain and indignation, and
the necessity for restraining any expression
of either, swelled in her
heart, painted her cheeks a deep red,
and lifted her lids with a fuller and
more scornful gaze than those soft
eyes were wont to give. Where was
the courtesy which any man, not
rudely insensible, should show to a
lady? Where the grateful tenderness
that any child, not cruelly ungrateful,
pays to a mother? This man could
be gallant when he wished to make
a favorable impression; and she had
heard him make very pretty, if very
senseless, speeches about chivalry and
ideal characters, as if he knew what
they were. He had even, in the
early days of their acquaintance,
maintained for a long time an irreproachable
demeanor in her presence.
She was learning a doubt and distrust
of men, judging them by this
one, of whom she knew most. Were
they often as selfish and insensible as
he was? Were they incapable of
being affected by any enchantment
except that which is lent by a delusive
distance? Here beside him
was an ideal affection, and he accepted
it as he accepted air and sunshine&mdash;it
was a matter of course. The mother
was in person one who might
satisfy even such a fastidious taste as
his; for though the face was thin and
faded, and the hands marred by
household labor, there were still the
remains of what had once been a
striking beauty. Mrs. Gerald carried
her tall form with undiminished
stateliness, her coal-black hair had
not a single thread of white among
its thick tresses, and her deep-blue
eyes had gained in tenderness what
they had lost in fire. To use one of
Miss Pembroke’s favorite expressions,
it was not fitting that the son, after
having passed a day without fatigue,
should lounge at ease among cushions,
while the mother, to whom
every evening brought weariness,
should sit beside him in a chair of
penitential hardness.</p>

<p>But even while she criticised him,
he looked up from the fire, his face
brightening with a sudden pleasant
recollection.</p>

<p>“O mother! I had almost forgotten,”
he said, and began searching
in his pockets for something. “Neither
you nor Honora mentioned it;
but I keep count, and I know that
to-day your ladyship is five times ten
years old.”</p>

<p>He smiled with a boyish pleasure
more beautiful than his beauty, and
the little touch of self-satisfaction he
betrayed was as far as possible from
being disagreeable. He could not
help knowing that he was about to
give delight, and cover himself with
honor in the eyes of these two women.</p>

<p>“Now, mother,” opening a tiny
morocco case, “this is the first ring
I ever gave any woman. The one
I gave Annette was only a diamond
of yours reset, and so no gift of
mine. But this your good-for-nothing
son actually earned, and had
made on purpose for you.”</p>

<p>He drew from the case a broad
gold ring that sparkled in the firelight
as if set with diamonds, and,
taking the trembling hand his mother
had extended caressingly at his
first words, slipped the circlet onto
her finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had no stone put in it, because
I want you to wear it all the time,”
he said. “Doesn’t it fit nicely?”</p>

<p>“My dear boy!” Mrs. Gerald exclaimed,
and could say no more; for
tears that she wished to restrain
were choking her.</p>

<p>A fiftieth birthday is not a joyful
anniversary when there is no one
but one’s self to remember that it
has come. Just as the mother had
given up hope, and was making to
herself excuses for his not remembering
it, her son showed that it
had been long in his thought. The
joy was as unexpected as it was
sweet.</p>

<p>When she said her prayers that
night, Mrs. Gerald’s clasped hands
pressed the dear gift close to her
cheek; and no maiden saying her
first prayer over her betrothal-ring
ever felt a tenderer happiness or
more impassioned gratitude.</p>

<p>“Dear Lawrence! it was so nice
of you!” whispered Honora, and
gave him her hand as she wished
him good-night.</p>

<p>He threw himself back in the arm-chair
again when he was left alone,
and for a few minutes had a very
pleasant sense of being happy and
the cause of happiness. “Who
would think that so much fun could
be got out of a quiet evening spent
in tying Mayflowers round a pole,
and giving a gold birthday ring to
one’s mother?” he mused. “After all,
the good people have the best of it,
and we scape-graces are the ones to
be pitied. If I were rich, I should
be all right. If I had even half a
chance, I would ask no more. But
the poverty!” He glanced about
the room, then looked gloomily into
the fire again.</p>

<p>Yes; poverty was there&mdash;that depressing
poverty which speaks of decayed
fortunes. The carpet, from
which the brilliant velvet pile was
worn nearly off, the faded and mended
covers of the carved chair-frames,
the few old-fashioned ornaments
which had been retained when all
that would sell well had gone to the
auction-room, each showed by the
scrupulous care with which it had
been preserved a poverty that clung
to the rags of prosperity in the past
because it saw no near hope of prosperity
in the future. Miles of unbroken
forest could be seen from the
cupolas of Crichton; yet in this room
the very stick of wood that burned
slowly on the andirons was an extravagance
which Mrs. Gerald would
not have allowed herself.</p>

<p>“Yes; the good ones have the
best of it,” the young man repeated,
rousing himself.</p>

<p>He drew the andirons out, and let
the unconsumed stick down into the
ashes, lighted a candle, and turned
the gas off. Then, candle in hand,
he stood musing a moment longer,
the clear light shining over his face,
and showing an almost childlike
smile coming sweetly to his lips.
“After all,” he said softly, “I haven’t
been a bad fellow to-night,” and
with that pleased smile still lingering
on his face, went slowly out of the
room.</p>

<p>And so the stillness of night descended,
and deep sleep brooded
over the town as the lights went out.</p>

<p>Crichton was a well-governed city:
no rude broils disturbed its hours of
darkness. Decency was in power
there, and made itself obeyed. You
might see a doctor’s buggy whirl by,
like a ghost of a carriage, its light
wheels faintly crunching the gravel;
for only the business streets were
paved. Now and then, on still
nights, might be heard the grating of
ropes, as some vessel sailed up to the
wharf after a long ocean voyage.
Perhaps a woman in one of the
houses on the hill above would hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
that sound through her dream, and
start up to listen, fancying that, in the
word of command the soft breeze
bore to her casement, she could detect
a familiar voice long unheard
and anxiously waited for. Perhaps
the sailor, whose swift keel had shot
like an arrow past the heavy junk of
Chinese waters, and scattered, as it
approached the shore, clear reflections
of tufted palms and dusky natives&mdash;perhaps
he looked eagerly up
the hill to that spot which his eyes
could find without aid of chart or
compass, and saw suddenly twinkle
out the lamp in the window of his
home.</p>

<p>But except for such soft sounds
and shadowy idyls, Crichton was at
night as still as sleep itself.</p>

<p>The Crichtonians had a pleasant
saying that their city was built by a
woman, and the best compliment we
can pay them is that they made this
saying proudly, and kept in honored
remembrance the hand of the gentle
architect. But not so much in brick
and stone was it acknowledged,
though they owed to her their first
ideas of correct and symmetrical
building: in their society, high and
low, in many of their pretty customs,
in their tastes, in their freedom
from bigotry of opinions, even in
their government, they felt her influence.</p>

<p>While the city lies sleeping under
the stars, strong, adult, and beautiful,
full of ambitious dreams, full, too, of
kind and generous feeling, let us go
back to the time when, an infant
town, it began to use its powers, and
stammer brokenly the alphabet of
civilization.</p>

<p>Hush, fair city, all thy many thousands,
while the angels watch above
thee! and, sweeter marvel yet! while
the dear Lord waits unsleeping in
thy midst, where that solitary taper
burns. Sleep in peace, “poor exiled
children of Eve,” and be grateful at
least in dreams.</p>

<p>Not very long ago, this place was
a wild forest, with a rude little settlement
hewn out of it on the river’s
banks. It was shut in from the
world, though the world was not far
distant. But the river was broad and
deep, the ocean only ten miles away,
and within a few miles were large
and growing cities. Soon the sound
of the axe and the saw were heard,
and little craft, sloops and schooners,
floated down the Saranac laden with
lumber till the water rippled close to
the rails. The story of her growth
in this regard is the story of a thousand
other towns. The vessels grew
larger, their voyages longer, more
houses were built, some men became
comparatively wealthy and gave employment
to others, while the majority
kept the level of the employed.
Social distinctions began to show
themselves, detestable ones for the
most part, since there was no social
cultivation. Indeed, this poor settlement
was in a fair way to become
the most odious of towns. The two
meeting-houses began to be called
churches by the aspiring; the leading
woman of the town ventured to call
her help a servant (on which the
indignant “help” immediately deserted
her); and the first piano appeared.
But let us mention this
piano with respect, for it was the
pioneer of harmony.</p>

<p>When Crichton had about fifteen
hundred inhabitants, a stranger came
there one day, as a passenger on
board a bark returning from a distant
city. This bark was the chief
vessel, and was owned by the three
chief men of Crichton. It had gone
away laden with laths, and it brought
back tea, coffee, sugar, and other
foreign groceries; and, more than
all, it brought Mr. Seth Carpenter.
He was not, apparently, a very remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
man in any way, except as
all strangers were remarkable in this
young town. He was plain-looking,
rather freckled, and had a pair
of small and very bright eyes which
he almost closed, in a near-sighted
way, when he wished to see well.
Behind those eyes was a good deal
of will and wit, and the will to put
the wit into immediate practice.
Moreover, he knew how to hold his
tongue very cleverly, and baffle the
curious without offending them.
Nothing but his name transpired.
He might be a mountebank, a detective,
a king’s son&mdash;how were
these people to know?</p>

<p>In fact, he was nothing more mysterious
than a respectable young
man twenty-five years of age, who,
having his fortune to make, had
thought best to leave his prim, sober,
native town, where nothing was being
done, and where the people were
mummies, and seek what, in modern
parlance, is called a “live” place.
In his pockets he had nothing but
his hands; in his valise was a single
change of linen.</p>

<p>The very morning of his arrival at
Crichton, Mr. Seth Carpenter went
to the highest hill-top, and from it
viewed the town, the river, and the
receding forests. He then strolled
down to the river, and looked
through the mills, and from there
sauntered to the ship-yard, where he
found a ship on the stocks, almost
ready to be launched. He walked
round the yard, whistling softly, with
an air of critical indifference. He
paused near two other men who were
viewing the ship, and, since their conference
was not private, listened to it.</p>

<p>One of these men, a sailor, rather
thought he might make up his mind
to buy that ship. Did his companion
know what was likely to be asked
for it? The other reckoned, and
calculated, and guessed, and expected,
and finally owned that he did not
know.</p>

<p>Mr. Carpenter, his eyes winking
fast with the sparks that came into
them, and his fingers working nervously,
walked out of the yard, and
found the owner of the ship, and,
still with nothing in his pockets but
his hands, made his bargain with all
the coolness of a millionaire. Before
sunset, the ship was nominally his;
and, before sunrise, it had changed
owners again, and the young adventurer
had made five hundred dollars
by the bargain.</p>

<p>“I will yet rule the town!” he
said exultingly, when he found himself
alone; and he kept his word.
Everything prospered with him, and
in a short time even rivalry ceased.
Men who had been proud to add
dollar to dollar shrank and bowed
before this man who added thousand
to unit. Half the men in
town, after ten years, were in his employment,
and business prospered
as he prospered. In another ten
years, Crichton was a city, with all
barriers down between her and the
great world; but a raw, unkempt
city; jealous, superficially educated,
quarrelsome, pretentious, and rapidly
crystallizing into that mould. Only
a person of supreme position and
character could now change it. Mr.
Carpenter had the position, but not
the character. He thought only of
money-making, and of the excitement
of enterprise and power; the
rest he viewed with a pleasant indifference
not without contempt. At
forty-five he was still a bachelor.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the first piano
with respect, because others followed
in its train, rendering a music-teacher
necessary; so that, after a succession
of tyros, Miss Agnes Weston came,
bringing the very spirit of harmony
with her into the town she was to
conquer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not come as a conqueror,
however; nor probably did she anticipate
the part she was to play any
more than the Crichtonians did.
She came to earn her bread, and,
while doing so, was anything but
popular. Nothing but her brilliant
musical abilities, and the fact that
she had been educated at Leipsic,
saved her from utter failure. People
did not fancy this self-possessed, unpretending
young person, who could
sometimes show such a haughty
front to the presuming, and who was,
moreover, so frightfully dark and sallow.
They did not understand her,
and preferred to leave her very much
to herself.</p>

<p>One person only found her not a
puzzle. To Mr. Carpenter she was
simply a refined woman among uncongenial
associates; becoming discontented
and unhappy there, too,
before many months had passed.
He did not choose that she should
go away. He had become pleasantly
accustomed to seeing her, had
sometimes met her on her long walks
out of town; and once, when he had
politely offered to drive her home&mdash;an
offer which any other lady in
Crichton would have accepted beamingly,
without the preliminary of an
introduction&mdash;had been refreshed by
receiving a cold refusal, and a surprised
stare from a pair of large black
eyes. The great man, surfeited
with smiles and flatteries, was immensely
pleased by this superciliousness.</p>

<p>But though strangely disturbed at
the prospect of Miss Weston’s leaving,
he hesitated to speak the word
which might detain her. A bachelor
of forty-five does not readily determine
on making a sensible marriage;
it usually needs some great folly to
spur him on to a change so long
deferred. He had, moreover, two
other reasons for delaying: he wanted
a charming wife, and was in
doubt whether even his power could
transform this lady into his ideal:
the other reason had blue eyes, and
a dimple in its chin, and was a very
silly reason.</p>

<p>But no one who knew this gentleman
would expect him to remain
long in doubt on any subject. Within
a month from the day he first
entertained the thought of running
such a risk, Crichton was electrified
by the announcement that Mr. Carpenter
was soon to be married to
Miss Weston; and, before they had
recovered from their first astonishment,
the marriage had taken place,
and the quiet, dark-faced music-teacher
was established as mistress
of an imposing mansion on North
Avenue.</p>

<p>It was now Mr. Carpenter’s turn
to be astonished, and he was enchanted
as well. Never had he
pictured to himself a woman so
charming as this grub, now become
a butterfly, proved herself; and never
had he imagined that even his wife
could obtain so beautiful a supremacy
as she gradually established and
never lost. She was born to rule,
and seldom had such power been
placed in any woman’s hands. Mr.
Carpenter was the first of her vassals.
With a refined and noble arrogance,
she esteemed him as the first man in
the world, because he had been the
first to appreciate and exalt her.
For this she gave him a faithful, if
condescending, affection, and quoted
his wishes and opinions so constantly
that one might have thought they
were her only guides. So thorough
was her tact and her courtesy toward
her husband he scarcely guessed
his own inferiority, and never
dreamed that she was aware of it.</p>

<p>She grew beautiful, too, as well as
amiable. Now that the drudgery
of toil was lifted from her, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
cramped talents had room for full and
exhilarating play, the swarthy skin
cleared, showing a peach-like bloom,
the fine teeth lit a frequent smile, and
the deep voice lost its dull cadence,
and took a musical, ringing sound.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carpenter used her power
well. Crichton was as clay in her
hands, and she moulded it after
a noble model. What arrogance
could never have done was accomplished
by tact and sweetness.
Her forming touch was strong and
steady, but it was smooth, and nothing
escaped it. Thoroughly womanly,
speaking by her husband’s mouth
when she deemed it not fitting that
her proper voice should be heard,
she could influence in matters where
women do not usually care to interfere.
She thought nothing out of her
province which concerned the prosperity
of the town she honored with
her presence, and she inspired others
with her own enthusiasm. That
streets should be wide and well kept,
that public buildings should be architecturally
symmetrical, that neat
cottages for the poor, replacing their
miserable huts, should start up
sudden as daisies along some quiet
road&mdash;these objects all interested her,
though she worked for them indirectly.</p>

<p>But in social life she ruled openly;
and there her good sense and good
heart, her gentle gaiety and entire
uprightness, became the mould of
form. Ill-nature went out of fashion,
and, in the absence of charity, self-control
became a necessity. When
people of opposite creeds met at her
house, their feuds had to be laid aside
for the time; and, once two foes
have smiled in each other’s faces, the
frown is not so easy to recall.</p>

<p>Gradually the change which had
been imposed outwardly became a
real one; and, when Mrs. Carpenter
died, full of years and of honors, her
spirit continued to animate the place,
in its opinions and actions, at least, if
some fairer grace of heart and principle
were wanting. She died as she had
lived, out of the church; though the
church had ever found her a friend,
bountiful and tenderly protecting.
Of its doctrines and authority she
seemed never to have thought; but
the copy of the Sistine Madonna in
her drawing-room had always a vase
of fresh flowers before it.</p>

<p>She left no children. A niece
whom she had adopted married in
Crichton, and had one descendant, a
grand-daughter, living there. This
grand-daughter was Honora Pembroke.</p>

<p>Wake again, Crichton, for morning
is come. Long rays of golden
light are shooting out of the east;
and down the hillside, in the church
of S. John, Father Chevreuse is saying,
<i>Sursum Corda</i>!</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">CONCLUDED.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Charles</span> had a dangerous enemy
in the person of the Duchesse d’Estampes.
She was furious at his being
allowed to enter France at all, and
still more at his leaving it without
paying such a ransom as his host
might easily have enforced; but to
all her arguments and blandishments
Francis was nobly inexorable; he remained
true, in this instance at least,
to the instincts of his better nature
and the promptings of knightly honor.
He could not, however, resist saying
to Charles, when presenting the duchess
to him: “Here is a lady who
advises me to undo at Paris the work
done at Madrid.” To which the emperor
replied coldly: “If the advice
be good, you ought to follow it.” The
story goes&mdash;a most improbable one,
considering the position occupied by
the Duchesse d’Estampes, whose jewels
were worthy of a queen of France&mdash;that
at supper that same evening,
when, according to the complimentary
custom of the times, she presented
Charles with the urn of perfumed
water to rinse his hands, he dropped
a diamond ring at her feet, and, on
her picking it up and handing it to
him, replied: “Keep it, madame; it
could not be in fitter hands.” Whether
Charles bribed the <i>belle savante</i> with
a diamond or any other device, it
is certain that, before he left, they
had become very good friends, and
she had quite adopted the king’s more
generous view of the case.</p>

<p>At the close of 1546, Francis fell
ill, and was supposed to be dying.
The courtiers, true to the traditions
of their race, immediately fled from
Fontainebleau to greet the Dauphin,
who was at Amboise. Francis was
conscious enough to notice their disappearance,
and to divine the cause
of it. It stung him to the quick, and
roused him to make a desperate effort
to disappoint them. He rallied, and
announced his intention of following
the procession of <i>Corpus Christi</i> next
day. The doctors remonstrated, but
in vain; nothing could shake the
king’s determination. He dressed
himself in his robes of state, had his
pale cheeks brightened with rouge,
and thus, under a mask of returning
health, appeared in the midst of his
astonished court, and held the canopy
during the procession. But the ceremony
was no sooner over than he fell
exhausted into the arms of his attendants,
and was carried back to
bed. He remained for some time
unconscious; on recovering his senses,
his first exclamation was, “Well, at
any rate, I will give them one more
fright!” Four months after this
childish piece of bravado, he died at
the Château of Rambouillet.</p>

<p>The forest of Fontainebleau was
infested during his reign with a quantity
of noxious vermin&mdash;serpents
eighteen feet in length, which did
great damage, and filled the inhabitants
with terror. One of these snakes,
by his depredations on man and
beast, earned the reputation for himself
of a sort of mythological dragon.
Some bold men had undertaken to
combat him, but all had perished in
the attempt. Francis declared at last
that he would fight and kill the dragon
himself. He equipped himself
accordingly in a suit of armor covered
all over with long blades as sharp as
razors, and, thus armed, sallied forth
to the perilous duel. The serpent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
coiled itself round the glistening
blades, and, in clasping his victim,
cut himself to pieces. This fantastic
exploit of Francis was magnified by
the adulation of his courtiers into a
deed of supernatural prowess.</p>

<p>The death of Francis was the signal
for the downfall of the Duchesse
d’Estampes, who retreated like a dethroned
sovereign before the now
transcendent star of Diana of Poitiers.
Diana’s frailty was unredeemed
by the intellectual gifts and native
kindliness that distinguished her rival.
There is no counterpart even
in French history to the sway exercised
by this Dalila over Henri II.
Madame Du Barry’s is the nearest
approach to it, but even that falls far
short of the precedent. Diana not
only ruled the king and the kingdom,
but openly usurped the honors, prerogatives,
and official state of a legitimate
queen. Her cipher, interlaced
with Henri’s, was carved and emblazoned
on all the public monuments;
not a door or gallery of Fontainebleau,
aptly nicknamed by the people “the
Temple of Diana,” that was not surmounted
by the monogram H. D.
It was to be seen in the stained glass
windows of the chapel, as well as on
the plate served on the royal table
under the eyes of Catherine de Medicis.
Diana appropriated the crown
jewels, and appeared at all the public
ceremonies decked in the hitherto
sacred regalia of the queens of
France. Catherine looked on and
was silent&mdash;she could wait; her hour
would come. It came sooner than
either she or Diana anticipated. The
king fell mortally wounded in a tournament
given to celebrate the nuptials
of his daughter, the Princesse
Elizabeth, with the King of Spain
(1559). He was carried to the nearest
shelter; Catherine flew to his side,
and gave orders that no one should
be allowed to approach him; at this
crisis, at least, the wife should be
supreme. Diana soon presented herself
at the door, but the guard refused
her admittance; the queen had forbidden
it. “And who dares to give
me orders?” demanded Diana, with
flashing eyes; “if the king breathes, I
have no master yet.” Soon he had
ceased to breathe, and Diana, without
further protest, bowed to the queen’s
command, which bade her “restore
the crown jewels, and retire forthwith
to her Château d’Anet.”</p>

<p>Her beauty was marvellous, and
lasted in all its bloom long after the
meridian of life was past. Brantôme
describes her at the age of sixty-five
as “still beautiful as a girl.” The
death of Henri II. was the signal for
Catherine de Medicis’ real queenhood.
Her reign lasted over thirty
years, and may be justly styled, in the
most comprehensive sense of the word,
a reign of terror for the nation. Her
first business was to create discord in
the family as a prelude to civil war
in the state. She imported into
France, with the enlightened love of
the arts imbibed at the court of the
Medicis, their crafty Italian policy;
a system of cabal and intrigue which
worked well enough in the narrow
compass of petty states, but was
fruitful of the most disastrous results
in a large kingdom where government
can only be carried on successfully by
well-organized institutions and strong
and wise laws justly administered.
Catherine was born with a genius for
intrigue; her love for conspiracy
amounted to a mania. The faculty
of dissembling, with which nature had
so pre-eminently endowed her, did
her good service in the first years of
her residence at Fontainebleau. It
required all the tact of an accomplished
dissembler to steer between
the rival powers of the Duchesse
d’Estampes and Diana of Poitiers&mdash;a
feat which the wily pupil of the Medicis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
achieved with singular success.
To the last day of their reign and
her own thraldom, she contrived to
remain friendly with both. Catherine’s
ambition was unbounded, and
drove her to excesses of wickedness
that have few parallels in modern
history. She systematically labored
to corrupt the minds and hearts of
her children, and to sow dissensions
amongst them, so as to draw the
power that should have been theirs
into her own hands. Jealousy of one
son, Francis II., drove her to espouse
the cause of the Huguenots for a
time; and, when his death placed the
sceptre in the hands of his brother
Charles IX., she veered round, and
persecuted her quondam <i>protégés</i>
with cold cynicism and ferocity. Five
civil wars can be traced home to the
dark intrigues of this unnatural mother&mdash;a
woman who never took a
straight road when she could find a
crooked one, who regarded human
beings as an apparatus composed of
an infinite variety of tools to be used
one set against another as the special
nature of her work demanded. The
massacre of S. Bartholomew was but
another manifestation of the same
spirit which had led her to stir up the
Huguenots to revolt when she thought
their rebellion would serve her aims.
This sanguinary despot had most of
the foibles of a woman, combined
with the fiercer passions of a man.
Her frivolity and extravagance knew
no bounds; and when her ministers
ventured to hint to her that the lavish
prodigality of her expenditure was
exasperating the people, and might
lead to trouble, she shrugged her
shoulders, and replied, with serene
simplicity: “Good heavens! one
must live.” The sweet, pathetic face
of Marie Stuart appears for a moment
at Fontainebleau in the earlier
days of Catherine’s rule&mdash;a bright
meteor flashing on a troubled sky;
poor Marie, whose sky was gathering
up the storm that was to break at no
distant day over her young life, and
beat it some twenty years with a fury
that was only to be silenced by the
great tranquillizer&mdash;death. Fierce
and long-raging were the storms that
swept over Fontainebleau through
the same darkling years. Henri de
Navarre bears down on it like a
whirlwind, and forces the queen, with
her son Charles IX., to fly before
him and his Huguenots to Melun.
They have not taken breath at Melun
when the Duc de Guise meets them
like a contrary wind, and blows them
back to Paris. Soon follows the night
of S. Bartholomew, that blackest of
black nights, under whose pall, as it
has been pithily put by a modern
Frenchman, “a few scoundrels killed
a few scoundrels.” Its gloom was
still hanging over the city when Catherine
and the king were bowling along
the road to Fontainebleau&mdash;he shuddering,
a Macbeth terrified at his
share in the ghastly deed; she triumphant,
unappalled by ghost or
conscience, her sharp, elastic mind
busy on the next step to be taken.
How was she to undo the one awkward
consequence of her triumph&mdash;the
remorse and mistrust of this faint-hearted
son? A hundred and fifty
maids, miscalled of honor, were recruited
from the beauty of France,
and brought to Fontainebleau to aid
in the task of soothing the king’s
scruples and mending the queen’s
nets. But her hold upon Charles
was loosened, and not all the charms
of all the houris of Mahomet’s
paradise would lure it to her grasp
again. Catherine, however, could
accommodate herself to the decrees
of fortune, and turn even her own
blunders to account. Charles, obdurately
sullen, refused to revoke the
edict of the pacification of Amboise,
thus quenching for once, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
lighting, the smouldering flames of
civil war. Catherine smiled bland
approval on her blighted schemes,
and was full of satisfaction, as if, instead
of chaining the war-dogs, she
had been allowed to let them loose.
She received the ambassadors in regal
state, and laid herself out to captivate
all men by her smiles and honeyed
courtesies; feuds and jealousies were
lulled to sleep with soft music of delight;
all the heads of all the factions,
civil and religious, turned in the dance
till they were giddy, carousing, and
embracing, and pledging one another
in loving cups, while their followers
were cutting each other’s throats hard
by; fireworks sent rockets blazing to
the sky&mdash;merry rockets, red, white,
and green; and Fontainebleau was
once more a palace of Armida, an
Arabian night’s dream, where men
came and drank, and were inebriated.
A dark and agitated scene is that
which France presents at the close of
Catherine’s reign. We turn from it
with relief to see Henri de Navarre
enter his “good city” of Paris. After
the peace of Vervins, which put an
end to religious wars in France, and
allowed Europe to breathe once more,
the gay Béarnais came to enjoy his
well-won conquest at Fontainebleau.
Sully, the true and trusty friend, goes
with him, supreme, though not alone,
in his influence with the soft-hearted
monarch. Gabrielle d’Estrée contests
the field with him; but, to
Henri’s honor be it said, she is defeated.
Gabrielle had, in a weak
moment, extracted from the king a
promise that he would make her
Queen of France&mdash;a promise which,
as a matter of course, he immediately
confided to Sully. The minister burst
out into indignant protest, and outswore
the Béarnese himself in the
vehemence of his indignation. They
parted, as usual, in a rage, and, as
usual, Henri soon calmed down, and
declared that Sully was right. When
Gabrielle recurred to the promise,
he told her the result of his conversation
with “my friend Rosny.” The
lady flew into a tantrum, called
Rosny hard names, and wound up
by insisting that “that valet” should
be dismissed from the court. The
insolent appellation, coming from
such a quarter, roused the king to a
sense of his own disgraceful weakness.
“Ventre S. Gris, madame,” he
cried, “if I must needs dismiss either,
it shall be you a thousand times
rather than my faithful Rosny&mdash;my
friend without whom I could not
live!” Gabrielle saw that she had
overstepped the mark; for Henri, if
he had the faults of a man, was no
emasculated puppet, like so many of
his predecessors, to be bound hand
and foot by a Dalila; he had still the
spirit of a king. Gabrielle fell at his
feet, and begged his pardon, and
Sully’s too. Shortly after this incident,
Sully’s fears on her account
were put an end to by her death.
Henri’s grief for a time was so violent
as almost to deprive him of his reason.
But his fickle heart soon found
consolation in a new allegiance.
Mlle. d’Entragnes was the next to
captivate it. For this fair siren, Henri
went so far as to draw out a written
promise of marriage. Before, however,
giving the document into the
hands of the fair lady, he, of course,
showed it to Sully, the dauntless
Sully, who was the most discreet of
confidants, but the most unmanageable
of accomplices. This time he
was too deeply moved for anger; he
did not bully the king, but coolly read
the paper twice over, and then, tearing
it deliberately into four fragments, he
flung it into the fire. “<i>Parbleu</i>,
Rosny, you are mad!” cried the
king. “Would to God, sire, I were
the only madman in France!” replied
Rosny. Henri turned on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
heel, and there was no more said
about that marriage. He married
finally Marie de Medicis. She gave
birth to the Dauphin Louis XIII.
at Fontainebleau. Henri’s joy was
unbounded. He made his wife
a present on the occasion of the
Château of Monceau with its beautiful
park and grounds, which had
formerly been a gift to Gabrielle
d’Estrée. Marie de Medicis was blest
with wonderfully robust health&mdash;a
fact which her husband comments
upon rather quaintly in a letter to
Sully ten days after the birth of the
Dauphin. “My wife,” he says, “dresses
her own hair, and talks already of
getting up; my friend, she has a
terribly robust constitution!” Sad
pity that anything should spoil the
attractive beauty of Henri IV.’s portrait
as it hangs before us in the long
gallery of royal sitters at Fontainebleau;
but, alas! there it is, the black
blot on the bright disk, the treacherous
breach of hospitality perpetrated
in his name toward an old companion
and brother-in-arms. There
is abundant proof that the arrest of
Maréchal de Biron and his death
were repugnant and painful to the
king, and that for some days he
combated both by every means in
his power, stooping to tears and passionate
entreaty with Biron, and
pleading eloquently in his behalf
with his own ministers; and that it
was only after all his efforts had
failed to convince the latter, or to
wring from Biron’s stubborn pride
the confession which could have saved
him, that Henri’s signature was
obtained for the death-warrant. This
no doubt absolves him from the
odium of a cold-blooded, premeditated
act of vengeance; but it is a poor
apology to say that he only consented
to invite his old brother-in-arms
to Fontainebleau, and let him be arrested
in a dark corridor at nightfall,
and taken to prison, and eventually
put to death, because he was overruled
and circumvented by the iron
will of his wife Marie with the “terribly
robust constitution.”</p>

<p>The gardens of Fontainebleau are
full of delicate and poetic memories
of Henri de Navarre in which Rosny
plays a prominent part. The courtiers
looked on at the familiar, schoolboy
friendship between the king and
his minister with envious eyes, and
set to work with malignant diligence
to loosen the bond. They succeeded
in getting up such a plausible story
against Rosny that the king, who
had been some time without seeing
him, was staggered; he examined the
deed of accusation, and admitted
that the circumstances looked badly.
The minister was in Paris working
away for his master as hard as any
galley-slave at the arsenal. Henri
sent for him. When he arrived, the
king was on the terrace surrounded
by the court; he greeted his friend
with a gracious formality foreign to
the habitual free and easy manner
of their intercourse. Sully was pained
and mystified. But the restraint
was equally intolerable to both.
Henri called him aside presently,
and they walked up and down an
alley in sight of the terrace, but out
of ear-shot. The king pulled out
the deed of accusation, and handed
it to his friend. Rosny cast his eye
contemptuously over the paper, and
in a few words scattered all its contents
to the winds. Henri saw that
he had been the dupe of a base,
designing jealousy, and broke out
into bitter self-reproach at having
been led to doubt even for a moment
the fidelity of his tried and
faithful servant. He held out his
hand; Sully, overcome with emotion,
was about to fall on his knees to
kiss it; but, quick as lightning, the
king caught him in his arms, exclaiming:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
“Take care, Rosny!
Those fellows yonder will fancy I am
forgiving you.”</p>

<p>The visit of the Spanish ambassador
to Fontainebleau led to the construction
of the large and handsome
Chapel of the Trinity. After going
all over the interminable galleries
and halls of the vast edifice, they
came to the chapel. It was very
pretty, but quite out of keeping with
the space and splendor of the rest of
the building. Don Pedro’s minister
was scandalized at the irreverence
implied in the contrast, and, with the
impulse of a Spaniard, exclaimed,
looking round at the narrow walls of
the little sanctuary: “Your house
would be perfect, sire, if God were
as well lodged in it as the king.”
Henri was pleased with the outspoken
rebuke, and at once set about
building a temple worthier of the
divine worship.</p>

<p>His ungovernable passion for the
chase was a frequent cause of altercation
between himself and Sully,
who shared his master’s love for
the sport, but, unlike him, knew
where to stop in the indulgence of
it. The title of <i>Grand Veneur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> attached
to the office of master of the
royal hounds, dates from Henri’s
time, and takes its rise from a phantom
which made its appearance in
the forest in the shape of a man
larger than life, dressed in black, and
surrounded by a pack of hounds,
and who vanished as soon as the
spectator tried to approach him.
Sully had long laughed at the story
of this spectre, but, once coming to
meet the king, he came face to face
himself with the <i>grand veneur</i>; he
owned to the fact, but was still sceptical,
though unable in any way to
explain away the mysterious apparition,
which he took great pains to do.</p>

<p>Louis XIII. resided much at Fontainebleau,
and continued the work
of embellishment, which needed little
now to make it perfect. Anne of
Austria enriched the new chapel
with many valuable paintings. For
a period, Richelieu is the presiding
genius of the grand old palace.
Then he passes away, and makes room
for Mazarin, who received here Henrietta
of England with a splendor
becoming her double majesty of misfortune
and royalty.</p>

<p>The first time that Louis XIV.
honored the palace with his presence
was on the occasion of signing
the marriage contract between Ladislas
of Poland and Marie de Gonzagne
(1645); the marriage itself was
celebrated at the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>Christina of Sweden furnishes one
of the most thrilling chapters in the
history of Fontainebleau. This eccentric
woman, whose ambition it was to
entwine the laurels of Sappho with
the jewels of her crown, gave up the
throne of Sweden to wander about
the world like an Arab. That sort
of eccentricity being rarer in those
days than in our own, it passed for
genius, wisdom, anything the owner
chose to call it. Christina gained
the reputation of possessing extraordinary
erudition, and a mind gifted
with the powers of a man, as well as
adorned with the graces of an accomplished
woman. Anne of Austria
was filled with admiration for
the queen who cast away a crown to
go in pursuit of science and philosophy;
and, when Christina announced
her intention of visiting France, the
regent made preparations to receive
her which surpassed anything that
Fontainebleau had witnessed since
the reception of Charles V. by
Francis I. Christina made her entry
on horseback, surrounded by a guard
of honor composed of the highest
nobles of the kingdom, all magnificently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
attired, and followed by a
<i>cortége</i> of noble dames, some riding
on horses caparisoned in housings of
cloth of gold and silver, others drawn
in chariots of state. The <i>fêtes</i> given
for the royal Sappho’s entertainment
were on a scale equal to the splendor
of this reception. She showed
her sense of Anne of Austria’s appreciation
of her superior merits by
making herself very agreeable to her;
but she earned the dislike of the
young king by ridiculing openly his
boyish love for Marie Mancini, and
pointing an epigram at the fair Italian.
Lo, when, on her return from
Italy, she intimated her intention of
again coming to France, Louis sent
word that he placed the Palace of
Fontainebleau at her disposal, but
begged she would not show herself
in Paris. During this second visit,
Christina committed the crime which
has so irretrievably damned her
memory. Monaldeschi, who had
been her pampered favorite for
years, rightly or wrongly incurred
her displeasure. Christina determined
that he should die, and did not
pause to consider that it was adding
a darker hue to her crime to perpetrate
it under the roof of a brother
king. The hour suited her vengeance&mdash;that
was enough. The
whole thing was planned with a business-like
coolness worthy of Louis
XI. in his best days. The queen ordered
her victim to be taken to the
<i>galerie des cerfs</i>, and herself gave the
most minute instructions as to how
he was to be killed, and by whom:
he was not to be despatched by one
or even a few successive blows, but
struck a great many times and at
short intervals, in hopes of extracting
certain avowals from him. Christina
then retired to an adjoining room,
and remained in animated conversation
with her <i>entourage</i> while the horrible
tragedy was going on close by.
Occasionally she sent in to ask if
Monaldeschi were dead; when the
answer again and again came back
that he was still struggling, she expressed
first surprise, and then impatience,
and at last, unable to brook
the delay, she rose and opened the
door of the gallery; Monaldeschi,
on beholding her, stretched out his
arms in an attitude of supplication,
but the queen exclaimed sharply,
“What! thou art not yet dead?”
and, walking up to where he lay
writhing on the ground, she slapped
him on the face “with that hand,”
says Voltaire, “which had loaded him
with benefits.” Monaldeschi had
cried out for a priest to help him to
die, and this last grace had been
granted. Christina stood by till her
victim was dead, and then quietly
paid the assassins, and went back to
her conversation. The news of the
abominable deed of blood travelled
quickly to Paris; as soon as Mazarin
heard it, he sent her a peremptory
order to leave Fontainebleau and
France forthwith, adding that the
King of France harbored no assassins
as his guests; to which Christina returned
the contemptuous reply that
“she was queen wherever she was,
and took no orders from the King
of France, and was accountable for
her acts neither to him nor any one
else.” It is curious to observe how
little horror seems to have been produced
in the public mind by this execrable
murder, committed under circumstances
which rendered it tenfold
more revolting; the ladies and courtiers
of the time make no more than
a passing mention of it in their letters,
and, in speaking of Christina, reserve
their sharpest criticism for her
style of dressing her hair and her manner
of dancing, which they condemn
as “fantastic and awkward.” Two
years after this event, we find Christina
abjectly begging for an invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
to the carnival ballet in which
Louis XIV. was to dance! The fact
of the invitation being granted is
perhaps as significant as that of its
being asked for. It was accompanied,
however, with the condition that
the Queen of Sweden should only
remain in Paris the three days that
the ballet lasted; this she agreed to,
and Mazarin’s apartments at the
Louvre were placed at her disposal.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. restored Catherine de
Medicis’ pavilion at Fontainebleau,
called the <i>Pavillon des Poêles</i>,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> for
Mary of Modena, and fitted it up in
a style of elegance and splendor befitting
rather a royal bride of France than
an exiled queen. But all his graceful
gallantry to the beautiful exile,
and professions of brotherly love to
her husband, did not prevent Louis
from signing in 1698 the treaty
whereby he pledged himself to recognize
the Prince of Orange, and
not to disturb him in the possession
of his kingdom.</p>

<p>Louis XV. was married in the
chapel at Fontainebleau to Marie
Leczinska (1725). He never cared for
the palace as a residence, and merely
used it as a hunting-lodge. His
first-born son died there. Shortly
before his death, the young prince,
leaning over a balcony from one of
the upper rooms of the palace which
looked towards Paris, was heard saying
to himself with a deep-drawn
sigh: “What delight the sovereign
must feel who makes the happiness
of so many men!” A great deal has
been built on this exclamation&mdash;regrets
for the blighted promise which
the feeling that prompted it held out
to France. But twenty years before,
Louis XV. had said as much, and felt
it, very likely, just as sincerely. Fontainebleau
was spared the shame of
the saturnalian orgies that profaned
Versailles and Trianon under the
reign of Du Barry. The grim towers
that had sheltered Francis, and the
Medicis, and Henry de Navarre had
many tales to tell that were better
left untold, but at their worst they
showed white beside the vulgar
blackness of the Pompadour and
Du Barry chronicles.</p>

<p>Louis XVI., who seldom visited
Fontainebleau, has left no mark of
his passages there. Under the Revolution,
it was used as the military
school which has since been transferred
to St. Cyr. Napoleon compensated
the royal old château for
the neglect of his predecessors; he
preferred it, next to St. Cloud, to all
the other palaces of which France
had given him temporary possession,
and repaired it with elaborate magnificence,
adhering rigidly to the
original style in every detail. He also
added a stirring chapter to its history.
When, by his orders, General
Radet scaled the walls of the Quirinal
at three o’clock in the morning, and,
attended by a band of soldiers, brutally
dragged Pius VII. from his bed,
it was to Fontainebleau that the
venerable pontiff was conveyed; here
he was kept in close confinement,
and fed upon the bread of insult, with
which it was Napoleon’s wont to
nourish his captives; but Pius VII.,
disarmed, isolated from friends and
counsellors, surrounded by spies paid
to interpret his every word and gesture
according to the interests and wishes
of their paymaster, broken in bodily
health, his mind bending under the
accumulated weight of every torture
that ingenious cruelty could devise,
was still a greater conqueror, in the
noblest sense of the word, than Napoleon
ever was on the field of
battle. Moreover, a day of reckoning
was at hand. Fontainebleau, which
had been the theatre of so many of
Napoleon’s most gorgeous pageants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
of the melodramatic and sentimental
kind&mdash;for he could be sentimental,
this great butcher of men and despoiler
of crowns; he could, “with delicate
forethought, and at vast expense,
cause a multitude of pine-trees to be
planted” amidst the elms and the
oaks of the sombre Medicean forest, in
order that his young Austrian bride
might find some reminiscence of
home when she walked out for her
evening stroll&mdash;Fontainebleau was to
witness the going down of his sun.
Fortune, exasperated at last by the
excesses of her spoilt child, plucked
the brilliant meteor from the sky, and
cast it out into the darkness. Once,
in an interview with Pius VII. during
his captivity, Napoleon, after lavishing
all his art of flattery on the pope,
stooping to tender caresses and the
most winning attitude of supplication
to wrest from his captive the coveted
concession of the Concordat, presently
paused to see the effect of the experiment.
Pius VII. was silent awhile,
then, looking up at the emperor with
a smile of withering scorn, he answered:
<i>Commediante!</i><a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Like lightning
the tactics were changed; curses
rained where kisses had been showered;
threats and gestures fierce as
blows succeeded to bland entreaties;
the actor struck his forehead with
clenched fists, stamped, grew red and
white in turn, and swore that a thunderbolt
should be hurled by the
Tuileries at the Vatican which should
crush her defiant pride, and bury all
Christendom under its ruins. Again
he “paused for a reply.” Pius raised
his eyes, and, looking fixedly at Napoleon,
murmured, this time with no
smile: <i>Tragediante!</i><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> The whole life
and character of the man are summed
up in those two epithets: <i>commediante,
tragediante</i>. But if Bonaparte
played comedy well, tragedy was his
forte, and his last appearance at Fontainebleau
was a splendid farewell
representation. It is a little past
mid-day. A bright April sun pours
down from a cloudless sky upon the
courtyard of the palace; the horse-shoe
staircase, bathed in the unmitigated
sunshine, gleams white and
majestic&mdash;a stage of the antique fashion
well suited for the closing act about
to be played upon it. The audience
are already gathered to the place;
thousands of the inhabitants have
flocked in from the town and neighborhood,
but the inner circle, the
reserved seats, are filled by the grenadiers
of the guard, the Old Guard of
a hundred battles and as many victories,
and by the marines of the young
guard. The time seems long, for
every heart is beating in sympathetic
emotion with the coming crisis. At
last the curtain rises. The doors
opening on the horse-shoe staircase
are thrown back, and Napoleon
comes forward. A cry goes up to
him from the depths of those many
thousand hearts. But hush! He
waves his hand for silence. He is
going to speak. The crowd sways
to and fro, a human wave ebbing at
the base of an adamantine rock,
whence its idol of twenty years looks
down upon it.</p>

<p>“Officers, non-commissioned officers
of the Old Guard, I bid you
farewell!... For twenty years
you have given me satisfaction. Be
faithful to the new sovereign whom
France has chosen. Grieve not for
my fate; I might have died, nothing
would have been easier to me&mdash;but,
no; I shall to the last tread the
path of honor. I will write what we
have done together....” Sobs,
such as break the stout hearts of
warlike men, interrupt him. He
waits for a moment, and then resumes:
“I cannot embrace you all,
but I will embrace your general.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Approach, General Petit.” The general
advances, and Napoleon clasps
him in a long embrace. “Bring me
the eagle!”</p>

<p>They bring it. He gathers the colors
to his heart, and kisses the symbol
passionately.</p>

<p>“Dear eagle! May these kisses
find an echo in the hearts of every
brave man!... My children,
farewell.” The voice that had electrified
them on a thousand battle-fields
ceased to speak; it has
stirred those brave hearts to their
depths; the veterans sob like women.
Napoleon descends the monumental
steps of the horse-shoe, and passes
through the midst of them in silence.
Bertrand is waiting for him at the
gate. He gets into his carriage, and
drives away. Thus the unrivalled
actor took his leave of the world-stage
on which he had figured so
long and so brilliantly. The colors
which he clasped in that last
touching embrace were henceforth
treasured as a sacred thing; half a
century later, they were laid on his
tomb at the Invalides.</p>

<p>The gallery of Diana, which had
been left unfinished by Napoleon,
was completed after the restoration
of the Bourbon. Louis XVIII. has
commemorated the achievements on
a slab bearing in golden letters the
date of the completion of the gallery&mdash;“<i>in
the 20th year of my reign!</i>”
And on the table on which Napoleon
signed his abdication he caused the
following to be engraved: “The
5th of April, 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte
signed his abdication on this
table in the king’s cabinet, the second
after the bedroom, at Fontainebleau.”
With the singular mixture
of obstinacy and simplicity which
characterized his Bourbon mind, he
systematically ignored in conversation
and in all official deeds the
reign of Napoleon altogether, and
continued to the last to date as if
that stormy meteor had never broken
in upon the dull horizon of his
sovereignty. Those inscriptions are
the only two traces of Louis XVIII.’s
passage which are to be found at
Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Charles X. never resided there, and
seldom even visited the palace. It
fell into sad neglect, but was entirely
restored by Louis Philippe, not only
the edifice, but the pictures and costly
works of art with which a long
line of sovereigns had so magnificently
endowed it.</p>

<p>Under the Empire, Fontainebleau
came in for the share of imperial
favor which was so impartially divided
amongst the still habitable castles
of France. Every autumn it was the
scene of brilliant hunting-parties and
varied hospitalities.</p>

<p>We will close this fragmentary
record of the past of Fontainebleau
by an incident, which, though not
yet within the range of history, may
one day take its place there, and be
quoted with interest as an indication
of the character of one destined, for
aught we know, to play his part in
the annals of the coming age.</p>

<p>The Prince Imperial, then a mere
child, was playing one day in the
<i>galerie des cerfs</i> with a little friend of
his, the son of an officer of the
household. Suddenly, in the midst
of their game, the latter rather irrelevantly
remarked: “This is where
Queen Hortense killed a man.”
“Queen Hortense was my grandmother,”
retorted the young prince
indignantly; “she never killed anybody!”
“Oh! but she did, though,”
persisted his companion; “she killed
one somewhere hereabouts; I’ve read
it in a book.”</p>

<p>This was too formidable an argument
to be met by mere words; the
descendant of the injured Hortense
clenched his little fist, and laid on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
vigorously to the traducer of his
grandmother. The noise of the battle
soon drew the attention of some
ladies who were at the other end
of the gallery; they ran to separate
the combatants, and inquire the
cause of the row; but the young
prince, crimson with rage, and with
the big tears rolling down his cheeks,
broke away from them, and rushed
to his mother, who was somewhere
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“He says that my grandmother
killed a man,” cried the child out loud,
“and I say it is a lie!” Then, throwing
his arms round the empress’
neck, he whispered: “It’s not true,
is it, that she ever killed anybody?”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c392" name="c392">LAUGHING DICK CRANSTONE.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not that soft, white, feathery
stuff that flutters to the ground pleasantly
and lighter than the fall of a
rose-leaf; that, dancing and darting
around and about everywhere with
gleaming whiteness and varied and
graceful motion, makes the empty air
seem a living thing smiling at its
own frolic. No; the snow was not
of that character at all. It was a
sharp, fierce storm that made at you
in a determined manner, as though it
had a sort of spite against you and
the whole human race generally for
bringing it down out of its bed somewhere
up there among the clouds;
that, as it was compelled to make the
journey, made up its mind to let you
and everybody else have the full
benefit of it. So down it came
fiercely in bitter lines so regular that
a William Tell might shoot an arrow
through them without touching a
single flake. It rushed at you, it beat
you in the face, it snarled around
your legs, it powdered your hair, and
made for the small of your back; it
peeped up your sleeves, and made acquaintance
with the inside as well as
outside of your boots, as though it
thought of getting a pair itself, and
wished to examine your shoemaker’s
handiwork. It laughed at umbrellas,
and made such a savage assault on
your overcoat and waterproof that it
was plainly as enraged as it could be
at being foiled, and in revenge settled
down on them, till it made you
look from top to toe as though you
had been just rolled in feathers,
<i>minus</i> the tar.</p>

<p>Ah! it was a dreary day&mdash;a day
that made one shiver and think of
the poor, and shiver again. It spoiled
the play of the children, and little
Bessy would sit “anyhow,” as her
nurse termed it, in her chair, with one
hand mechanically endeavoring to
pull the cane at the back of it to pieces,
while her big round blue eyes would
look out in silent wonder at the ugly
day; and little Benny would flatten
his already flat nose in desperation
against the window-pane, creating
quite a little atmosphere of fog
around him; while Harry, the big
brother, ten years old last birthday,
would make a false attempt to keep
up his spirits by riding that imaginary
horse round and round the room,
making him curvet and caper, and
shy at that corner, and evince a particular
dislike to the nurse, and kick
so furiously at the door-key, till a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
crack of the whip suddenly brought
the restive animal to his senses,
and Harry would be still a moment,
and gaze silently with the
rest of the world out at the cheerless
snow.</p>

<p>Was it the snow that Cranstone of
Cranstone Hall was gazing at so
fixedly out of the library window?
Was it the snow that made those
cheeks so deadly white, save for the
two little purple spots on each of
them? Was it the snow that made
him clench his hands till the nails
almost tore the flesh? What was he
looking at so fixedly out there in the
Park? What did he see out in the
blinding snow, driving down on his
own meadow-lands, and draping the
strong forms of his ancestral oaks in
mystic drapery, while from the bottom
where the river ran, stole up a snaky
mist in curling ashy-gray folds? He
saw no snow, no mist, no oaks: he
looked through them, beyond them,
straight out at a tall form striding
along, its back to Cranstone Hall,
and its face to the wide, wide, bitter,
cold world&mdash;striding on, and on,
and on, and never looking back to
the home where he fell one day
like one of these little snowflakes
out of heaven, and grew up straight,
and tall, and honest, and true,
and manly, with a head, and a
handsome head too, on his shoulders,
and such a heart in his bosom!&mdash;the
pride of all the country-side, and
the heir of Cranstone Hall. It was
Dick Cranstone whose figure his
father was gazing at so fixedly, though
that figure had been gone three
hours, and was far out of sight&mdash;Dick
Cranstone, his father’s only son,
the only relic of his dead mother, the
boy on whom all the father’s strong
heart was now set, who was striding
along through the snow and the mist
out into the bleak world on that winter
morning, cast out from his father’s
hearth and heart, driven away with a
bitter curse.</p>

<p>What had Dick Cranstone done to
bring down this curse and chastisement
on his handsome young head?
Dick and his father had been companions
as well as father and son, for
Ralph Cranstone was still a youngish
man, and bore such years as he had
well. His heart and his hopes were
centred in this boy, whose mother
had been snatched away so early;
and when he saw the bright-eyed,
laughing lad ripen into a great, handsome,
clever young fellow, who rode
with him, and played cricket with
him, and scoured over the country
neck and neck with him&mdash;for there
was a dare-devil drop in the Cranstones&mdash;it
would be hard to find a
happier man in this world than Ralph,
or a more loving son than Dick;
in fact, “Oh! they’re as fond of each
other as the Cranstones” had grown
into a proverb in all the country-side.
What, then, was Dick’s great crime
that left him in a day fatherless, and
his father childless, and rent asunder
with a fierce wrench two hearts which
all their lives had run together?</p>

<p>The Cranstones were an old family,
older than Elizabeth, though it
was at her time that Cranstone Hall
first came into their possession.
That was a good reign for people
blessed with an elastic conscience.
The Elizabethan Cranstone was a
Catholic. He had the choice of
running his neck in a noose and dying
a martyr for his faith, or renouncing
the religion he believed in, and
taking instead the goodly Abbey of
Cranstone, with its river, meads, and
all its appurtenances. He did not
hesitate long. Like most of his
countrymen, he threw up his religion,
and took to the abbey, turned out
the monks, became a bitter persecutor
of the church, changed the name
of the place to Cranstone Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
lived to a good old age, and the rich
man died and was buried&mdash;in Cranstone
churchyard. The old country
folk round about tell you that this
particular old Cranstone, whom they
look upon as the first of the race,
“died a-yellin’ for holy water like
hell-foire”; but then, such people are
always foolish. However, to come
back to the story, the Cranstones remained
from that day out a flourishing,
wealthy family, strongly devoted
to church and state, fierce persecutors
of the Catholics whilst persecution
was the fashion; when not so,
what Catholics call bigoted Protestants.</p>

<p>Ralph was no exception to the
rule. He honored the queen, and
hated the pope and Papistry as genuinely
as the old Elizabethan Cranstone
had professed to do. He
thought the country was going to
ruin when he found Papists throwing
up their heads, and walking about
on English ground, just as though
they had as much right there as anybody
else. And when his old friend
and neighbor Harry Clifford, who
had been at Eton and Oxford with
him, and whom Ralph had pronounced
over and over again “the
best fellow going,” turned Catholic
one fine day, as soon as Ralph heard
of it, and met Harry by chance at a
friend’s, he turned on his heel, and
walked out of the house, leaving the
latter standing there with the old
friendly hand outstretched towards
him. From that day out, all intercourse
ceased between the Cliffords
and Cranstones, and the old friends
were as dead to each other as though
they had never met.</p>

<p>In good time, Dick went off to
Oxford, with an Eton fame as a
good bat and all-round cricketer, a
handy man at the oar, the best runner
and jumper in the school, added
to the lesser reputation of being able
to knock off the best Latin poem in
the college, and running Old Barnacles
hard for the head of the class&mdash;Old
Barnacles, who did nothing but grub
at his books night and day, and who
sucked at Greek roots as little chaps
would at lollipops. He made one
of “the eleven” that year against
Cambridge at Lord’s, and saved the
game from becoming a disastrous defeat
to his university by his plucky
and cool play against that terrible
left-hand bowler. How proud his
father was of him that day! He
could almost have gone up and shaken
hands with Harry Clifford, whom
he saw there with his wife and
a beautiful young lady in the carriage,
so divided in looks between
Harry and his sweet wife that she
could have belonged to no one else but
to them. “A Clifford to the tip of
her nose!” he kept repeating to himself,
as he stole a sly glance at them
now and then, and yearned for a
grasp of his old friend’s hand; but
the stubborn Cranstone blood was
too strong within him, and he turned
away slowly to watch the game.</p>

<p>It was going badly for Oxford in
the second innings; the Cambridge
men had a hard hitter in, who hit so
hard and so furiously, and had so
completely “mastered the bowling,”
that the score mounted rapidly, and
every new hit elicited shouts of applause
for Cambridge. All over the
field flew the ball, sometimes in
among the rows of carriages which
lined the ground. “They’ll never
get him out,” said the spectators one
to another, as the Cantab struck
away right and left as freely as
though he were playing with the
bowlers. “There she goes! Bravo!
Well hit!” they shouted, as the ball
flew from the bat right across the
field, straight and furious, full at the
carriage where were seated the Cliffords.
“Look out there! Look out&mdash;look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
out!” they shout, as the carriage
party, conversing together, are utterly
unconscious of the danger approaching
them. It takes a long time to
tell this here, though it was all over
in half a minute. The cricket-ball
was flying at lightning speed straight
at the head of the young lady, who
at the moment was looking in another
direction, inattentive to the
warning cries that rose from all parts
of the field. The shouts were hushed
into that deadly silence that will settle
so awfully over a vast assembly
when every eye is bent in one direction,
and every heart beats as one
great one with the expectation of immediate
disaster. All saw the danger
of the young girl, but no one
could prevent it, when suddenly
there is a rush of something white, a
leap in the air, a bare arm flashes in
the sun, and the ball is clasped in the
hand of one who never missed a
catch yet, as he falls back over the side
of the carriage, right in among the
party, holding the ball all the while,
and the great Cantab is out.</p>

<p>“Bravo, Cranstone! Bravo, Cranstone!”
What a shout from the Oxonians!
What a shout and a rush
from all sides of the field to applaud
the young fellow whose Eton fame
had not belied him for speed, and
whose swiftness and agility, and that
high leap in the air and splendid
catch, had perhaps saved a young
girl’s life, while it rid his side of a
terrible foe, and revived the hopes
of Cambridge! But Cranstone never
heeded the shouts; he lay back there
in the carriage, lifeless, his head on
Harry Clifford’s knee, his eyes closed,
and his face white, while the frightened
ladies, who scarcely yet knew
from what a danger they had escaped,
bent over him in terror. He had
fallen heavily on the side of the carriage,
and the shock caused him to
faint.</p>

<p>The crowd is parted by a strong
man, who rushes wildly to the spot.
“Dick, my boy, Dick, are you hurt?
Good God! Harry, it’s my son.
Water, some of you&mdash;water. Clear
away there, and let him have air!”
The water is brought, and in a few
moments he revives, to open his eyes
on a pair of the tenderest blue eyes
looking pityingly and frightened into
his. A shake or two, like a strong
mastiff, and he is all right again;
the game goes on, and, though Oxford
was beaten, that catch lives in
men’s memories; while Ralph Cranstone
and Harry Clifford were old
friends again, and Mr. Dick Cranstone
was reintroduced to his old
playmate, Miss Ada Clifford.</p>

<p>Dick went back to Oxford that
year with another feeling creeping
into his heart side by side with the
great love for his father which had
hitherto possessed it. He was not
over head and ears in love with Ada
Clifford, nor, since it must be confessed,
she with him; but his father
and himself rode over often that vacation,
and Dick found the family
one of the most agreeable in
every way that he had ever met,
while Ralph atoned for his former
rudeness in a thousand ways that
come with such an indescribable
charm from a strong nature. Dick
took back this memory with him to
the university, and perhaps it saved
him from getting among the “fast
men”&mdash;a society only too fascinating
for young fellows blessed with health,
strength, good nature, good looks,
and money.</p>

<p>Without actually giving up his
practices of muscular Christianity,
association with more intellectual
minds brought him soon to perceive
that there was a higher ambition in
this life for a young man than being
the captain of a cricket eleven, the
“stroke” of a university eight, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
best pigeon shot, or the proprietor
of the most startling “turn-out” on
the road. Association with intellectual
men brought with it intellectual
thoughts, inquiries, pursuits; while
under all happily ran the boy’s innate
love of honor, of what was fair and
truthful, supporting him somewhat,
and keeping him, on the whole,
straight in the midst of the dangerous
speculations and vexed problems
which were being agitated around
him, and discussed with all the boldness
natural to undisciplined minds.</p>

<p>His Oxford course was drawing to
a close, and he began to think of
adopting some career, though the
wealth and property to which he was
heir necessitated no pursuit at all
other than that of a quiet country
gentleman living on his estates. During
his last year particularly he had
read and studied much, and the result
of his studies and inquiries always
came home to him in the form
of the old question of Pilate, What
is truth? He was, like his father, a
loyal Englishman, a supporter of the
state, rather because he found it
there established, and could see no
better, than for any divine right
which, in his father’s mind, and in the
minds of so many Englishmen, the
glorious British Constitution possesses.
But the church was another
affair. That question puzzled him
sorely. That it might be a very fine
institution, that it had given birth to
many splendid minds, that it still
possessed many very amiable and
worthy followers, he did not deny;
but that an institution which was at
best a very mixed affair, which was
not believed in by the majority of his
countrymen, which had been patched,
and stretched, and mended, and
cobbled to meet the exigencies of
every changing hour, which was not
believed in even by so many of its
professed members and teachers, was
in any sense a divine institution, he
could not concede. To his truthful
mind, it dated from Henry VIII. and
Elizabeth, not from Jesus Christ; it
was simply in its present form an
amiable machine of state, not a divine
organization which should command
the approving consent of all
were it what men who believed in
salvation ought to follow. As for
the rest of the wrangling sects, he
looked upon them as so many ecclesiastical
tinkerings, better calculated
to bore holes in the edifice of faith
than to build up a system strong,
enduring, and right.</p>

<p>Filled with thoughts of this description,
he came home restless,
dissatisfied, questioning; too true and
too earnest to throw quite overboard
all belief as a sham, and take the
world as he found it&mdash;a mixture of
good and bad, inexplicable save as a
result of chance and conventionality.
He visited the Cliffords, and they
found laughing Dick Cranstone an
altered man, somewhat graver, and
evidently unsettled. One day, when
his father was not present, he unbosomed
himself to Mr. Clifford, who
was a very intellectual man. The
latter listened kindly to the boy,
though he knew the story well; he
had gone through it all himself.
He did not try to explain matters
there and then; he merely told him
that what he was then experiencing
was the exact counterpart of what
he himself had experienced. “If
you like to come over in a few days,
I expect to have F. Leslie here, a
Jesuit, and a convert like myself.
He will explain matters to you much
better than I can, if you are not
afraid of meeting a Jesuit, Richard.”</p>

<p>Dick winced a little at this proposal;
he had never in his life met with
a Jesuit, and his opinion of the society
was formed on what he had read
of them as the most deceitful, crafty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
and cunning set of men ever organized
to blind men’s eyes and lead
them astray from freedom and light;
though, when he came to think the
matter over, he could not bring to
mind a single case of any of his
friends who had come across them
and been converted to Catholicity,
as some of them had, turning out
fiends or blind enthusiasts. So he
resolved to meet F. Leslie.</p>

<p>It was the old story. After due
inquiry and preparation, he was converted,
and immediately after went
straight to his father, and told him all.</p>

<p>To describe Ralph Cranstone’s
wrath at the news would be impossible.
He only saw one terrible
fact&mdash;his family disgraced for ever in
the person of their last descendant
his son, from whom he had hoped so
much. The line of the Cranstones
was poisoned, defiled in the person
of one who could thus turn traitor
to his queen and country. A Cranstone
a Papist! And that Cranstone
his son Dick! He did not ask him
to retract&mdash;he rose up and cursed the
boy, and turned him out of the house.</p>

<p>Protestant friends, this part of the
story, though inwoven with fiction, is
a very hard fact. It is not of unfrequent
occurrence; the writer to-day
has friends who in their own persons
can corroborate it.</p>

<p>Ralph Cranstone could have borne
anything rather than this&mdash;that his
son should turn Papist. He might
become an infidel, and believe in no
God at all; he might join any one
he chose of the sects, however low;
he might even turn Mussulman or
Jew&mdash;but a Cranstone a Papist!
Good God! it were better that he
had never been born.</p>

<p>And so Ralph sat there looking
out into the storm, where the form
of his brave, handsome boy had vanished.
He was conscious only of
the storm raging in his own breast,
of the terrible curse he had uttered
out of his heart on the head of the
one he had loved more, infinitely
more, than himself. That curse was
ringing around the room still, and
seemed to mock him like a fiend.
He rose at last, and staggered to his
room, not noticing the tearful old
housekeeper, who knew that something
dreadful had happened, and
who came timidly asking him to take
something to eat, for the day had
gone. His day had gone out with
his boy, and the light of his life went
out with Dick into the winter storm,
to be swallowed up and buried away
in it for ever.</p>

<p>Dick had a hard time of it. He
refused all offers of assistance tendered
him by Mr. Clifford. He would
not even go down to visit them; he
would not appear in the neighborhood;
for he could not meet his
father again. He wrote to him many
times, but his letters were always
returned unopened. He soon received
news from Mr. Clifford that his
father had broken up his home, left
the neighborhood, and gone no one
knew whither. He could only pray
for him to the God to whom, for the
first time in his life, he found he could
pray with a strong faith and earnest
belief. He still would not go to the
Cliffords’, though he corresponded
with them from London, and saw
them now and then when they came
up. He had friends on the press,
and with their assistance managed to
eke out enough to live upon by means
of his pen. He worked away, sustained,
in his loss of father, fortune,
and place, by the religion of Jesus
Christ, discovering each day new
wonders in an exhaustless region.
His father he never heard from, nor
gained any intelligence of his whereabouts,
nor whether he was living or
dead. The trial was a sore one, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
he felt that perhaps he was in some
small degree atoning for all the evils
which had followed that first defection
of his family from the religion to
which they belonged. And so he
worked away, and rose; for he had
talent, and soon attained a position
which relieved him from all fears of
absolute want, though still poor
enough.</p>

<p>The Cliffords were a great comfort
to him, and the thought of Ada often
inspired the weary pen to fresh
exertion when it flagged from sheer
fatigue. The more he found the love
of her growing upon him, the more
he avoided the presence of the family;
for his poverty set a boundless sea, in
his imagination, between himself and
her. He excused himself for not
calling on them by a thousand reasons&mdash;press
of business, and the usual
excuses; till at last their intercourse
almost ceased, and poor Dick,
laughing Dick, became wretchedly
miserable, and began to look upon
the world as a poor sort of place after
all, while Cranstone Hall would force
itself upon his mind, dreary and deserted,
the garden weedy, and the
oaks lonely, with that terrible, heartless
curse hanging over all.</p>

<p>One night, while seated in his room
thinking such thoughts as these, a
hasty knock came to the door, and,
opening it, the old housekeeper fell
forward almost fainting in his arms,
with the exclamation:</p>

<p>“O Master Richard! Master
Richard, dear! he’s come back at
last.”</p>

<p>Dick staggered as though the old
woman’s trembling voice had been a
giant’s arm which smote him.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake and your dear
mother’s, Master Richard, fly! He’s
ill&mdash;he’s dying&mdash;he’s raving of you!...
At the Hall.... Yes. Go, go,
or you’ll be too late.”</p>

<p>He rushed into the street, she following
him. The snow was falling
again as bitterly as on the day when
he last saw his father. The train,
though it flew along, seemed to him
to travel at a snail’s pace. The snow
blocked the roads leading to the Hall:
the chaise could not advance. He
leaped out, unyoked one of the horses,
bade the driver follow as best he
could with the housekeeper, mounted
the animal, and, by what means he
never knew, found himself at the Hall.
He was about to dash up to his
father’s rooms, when a light in the
library window attracted his attention.
Mother of God! can that be his
father?</p>

<p>The brown curls bleached to snow,
the face white, and thin, and bloodless,
the eyes staring wildly straight
out of the window, the form shrunk,
the mouth mumbling some incoherent
words. The light of a candle shone
full on his father’s face, altered to that
of a ghost.</p>

<p>Dick entered trembling, uncertain
whether it was a spirit or his father
himself whom he saw before him.</p>

<p>“I want my boy, my Dick, my
brave, handsome son. Bring him
back to me. You stole him away.
Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Father, he is here. Look at me,
father. Here I am, Dick&mdash;your own
son Dick, come back to you. Do
you not know me?”</p>

<p>“You? You’re not my son. I’ve
got no son. He went away from me.
He hates his father&mdash;his poor father.
I&mdash;I&mdash;cursed him, when I could have
blessed him, and he believed me; and
Dick’s gone&mdash;gone&mdash;gone.” And the
poor creature moaned, and covered
his crazed head with his hands, while
the sharpest pang that ever rent his
boy’s heart rent it at that moment
with the thought that, perhaps, it was
all his fault, and that, had he only
forced himself upon him, his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
might have forgiven him, all might
have gone well, and he would not
now have been summoned to the side
of the lost wreck before him.</p>

<p>They bore him back to the bed
whence he had stolen while those who
should have watched him had dozed
a little. The next day the Cliffords
came over, and took up their abode
in the old Hall, where Ada and her
mother watched and tended the sufferer
as only women can do. Dick
was around them and about them,
and in and out, and happy and miserable,
and all contraries in a breath.
Ada alone could set him right, and
prevent him from going as mad as his
father.</p>

<p>Ralph lay long between the two
worlds. His strong reason; once
forced out, seemed sullen to return.
But it did come at last, and his weak
eyes opened on his son, while the
heart of the father, with all the pent-up
feelings of these years, gushed out
over his boy. He had gone away
and wandered everywhere. He
drank till his brain gave way, and
only enough reason was left to lead
him home to die.</p>

<p>But death seems a long way off
from Ralph Cranstone yet. The saying
is oftener than ever on people’s
lips, “They’re as fond of each other
as the two Cranstones.” Old Cranstone’s
face&mdash;the Elizabethan&mdash;has
taken a new scowl, for underneath
his picture rises up an ivory crucifix
which Ralph himself set there. The
snow falls merrily and cheerily; the
old oaks smile in their winter garb;
no mist rises up from where the river
runs. Yes; that’s young Ralph there
dashing out of the hall door to meet
his uncle and papa; there he goes
climbing up uncle’s legs, and shaking
him as though he were a telegraph
post set up there for him to shake;
and, if ever there was a happy couple,
that couple is Ada and laughing Dick;
and the old Cranstone frowns down
on it all out of his dim canvas, for the
Cranstone line has gone back to its
old faith.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c400" id="c400">THE PRESENT GREATNESS OF THE PAPACY.</a></h2>

<p class="pc1 reduct">FROM THE CIVILTA CATTOLICA.</p>

<h3 class="p1">I.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">We</span> do not know that history, ancient
or modern, offers a spectacle
similar to the one presented to the
world by the Vatican to-day. Upon
the brow of that hill sits an august
Pontiff and king, an octogenarian,
unarmed, dethroned, a prisoner. He
is strong only in the power infused
into him from God; rich only in
heavenly wisdom and the love of
nations; great in his merits towards
Christendom; great, above all, in the
treasure of rights divine and human
which he represents. The powers
of earth have attacked or forsaken
him; the base world concentrates
against him all its rancor for the extermination
of everything that Christian
civilization holds sacred. Standing
alone, with serene brow and
heart unshaken, he lifts his head before
this concourse. He humbles,
confounds, sears them; the more furious
the attack, the more does he
show himself invincible to assault
and terrible to assailants.</p>

<p>The enemy has hitherto triumphed
over all and conquered all; subduing
empires, destroying kingdoms,
subjugating nations. He holds in
his hand all the instruments of brutal
force, and in his service all the passions
of brute nature. He is to-day
almost master of the civilized globe;
yet he cannot rule that venerable
man of eighty years, who stands as
high in glory and authority as the
opponent lies low in vile infamy.</p>

<p>Such is the spectacle, historically
unique in all its accessories, which
we have witnessed for several years,
and have never seen so grand and
august in aspect as to-day&mdash;the contrast
between Pope Pius IX. and the
Revolution. Unique, we say, for in
no age of Christianity do we find
its equal for the universality of war,
and arms, and desolation, or for the
duration and variety of outrages.
Therefore, the contrasts between Gregory
VII., Innocent III., Boniface
VIII., and Pius VII., with the impious
sovereigns who dared to oppress
them, do not in several points present
a parallel.</p>

<p>There are feeble spirits, unmindful
of the past, and weak of faith in
the unfailing promises of Christ, who
cannot read the lucid words graven
by his finger on the tiara of Pius IX.:
I am the strength of God; let no
man touch me!</p>

<p>Through the shower of hostile
darts raining around the Vatican
they do not discern the glory of moral
grandeur radiating from it. Therefore
they are discouraged and scandalized.
For the comfort of such as
these, it seems well to speak of this
grandeur, which, in our opinion, is
clearly shown in the glorious cause
defended by the Pontiff, in the mode
and circumstances of his defence, in
the quality of the enemies who attack
him, as well as of the friends who
support him.</p>

<h3 class="p2">II.</h3>

<p>The cause for which Pius IX.
wages so stern a war is the cause of
God and man; the cause of liberty,
individual, domestic, and social; in
short, a cause embracing all those
ordinances without which no public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
or private right, no property, or virtue,
or justice, or peace, could be
maintained. In the Sovereign Pontiff
temporarily imprisoned in the
Vatican, the Revolution attacks not
only the liberty of the supreme Catholic
apostolate and the legitimacy
of the most inviolable of thrones,
but also all rational liberty of conscience,
and the source of all social
authority. In the Sovereign Pontiff,
it attacks God, whose vicegerent on
earth he is, and with God all rights
and duties of nature and of grace,
which proceed originally from him.</p>

<p>The Revolution, essentially satanic,
full of hate towards God and man,
<i>extollitur supra omne quod dicitur
Deus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> It tries to supplant God,
whose every image in creation it
would gladly see cancelled. From
the beginning, it has always attacked
the Papacy as the most vivid and
universal representation of God among
men; of God under the double aspect
of Creator and Saviour, author
of reason and faith, eternal founder
of natural society and of the church;
in one word, of Christ the God-man.
As it cannot dethrone Christ in heaven,
it would dethrone him on earth:
and, to accomplish this hellish work
of madness under the guidance of
Satan, it directs all its efforts against
the Roman Pontificate, truly the true
vicariate of Christ, the king of the
world.</p>

<p>All moral grandeur, human and
divine, is therefore included in the
cause defended by Pius IX. against
the ministers and satellites of the
enemy of human nature and of God’s
Word. The accursed phalanx make
use of innumerable frivolous and
false pretexts to reach their aim; but
in truth they thirst to destroy the
Papacy because the Papacy embraces
all morality of reason and faith emanating
from the Word, the unchangeable
and eternal wisdom. In vain
the Revolution masks its batteries
behind the dazzling names of liberty,
civilization, and progress, pretending
to seek the destruction of the Papacy
as their implacable adversary. Indeed,
after eighty years of experience,
it is evident, palpably certain,
that under its false liberty lies hidden
the most ruinous tyranny that ever
oppressed the world. It usurps the
dominion of conscience and of family
life, and confiscates at its wanton and
fickle will the blood and gold of nations
which it has trampled underfoot,
giving them in return only the
liberty of corruption and blasphemy.
Its treacherous civilization covers a
refined barbarism fully shown by the
carnage and ruin of France in 1793,
and of Spain in 1834, and by the
massacres and conflagrations of the
Commune in 1871. Its baleful progress
tends to change the partnership
of Christian nations into a horrible
hell of disorder, where, as in the
kingdom of Satan, <i>nullus ordo sed
sempiternus horror inhabitat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Therefore, strictly speaking, Pope
Pius IX., with his indomitable resistance,
defends all the wealth of humanity
against the monster that
would destroy it as the communists
destroyed it before our eyes in Paris
lately. The religious, civil, and
material ruin of the human race is
the final end for which, directly or
indirectly, with or without deliberate
purpose, all the partisans of the Revolution
exert themselves, from the
most hypocritical or dull of moderates
to the grossest socialist.</p>

<p>The immeasurable grandeur of this
cause defended by the Roman Pontiff
is generally seen and felt by all,
even more by the enemies than by
the friends of the Papacy. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
their war against the Vatican they
have concentrated their best strength,
sagacity, and industry. They care
for nothing so much as for the least
trifle connected with the Pope; they
talk, and write, and vociferate of nothing
so much as of the Pope’s sayings
and doings; of the hopes and
fears which agitate them in this war.
Hence the first position in the political
world and in what we call public
opinion is held by the Pontiff. It is
preserved to him and nourished by
that very Revolution which would
gladly annihilate for ever his name
and memory. It cries a thousand
times a day that he is dead and buried,
and a thousand times a day it
is forced to bewail his vitality and
energy; neither more nor less
than do the demons and the
damned in the abyss, forced to
glorify God for ever, in that they
will eternally blaspheme him.</p>

<p>This is one of the marvellous
sports of Providence in our day: to
make use of the wild beasts of the
Revolution to strengthen the Papacy.
When they think to devour it, they
find themselves drawing its triumphal
car. So it was with Nero and Domitian
in their persecutions against
Christianity; so with Henry IV. and
Barbarossa in the middle ages; so
with the Directory and Bonaparte in
modern times. What doubt can
there be that the same will come to
pass with the Lanzas, the Bismarcks,
and their compeers in our own day?</p>

<h3 class="p2">III.</h3>

<p>But the glories of the cause for
which Pius IX. is fighting receive
also wonderful lustre from the strange
modes and conditions of his warfare.
He has neither arms nor soldiers; he
is poor in gold; neither diplomacy,
nor journalism, nor the telegraph is
subject to his orders; he is morally
deprived of the liberty of leaving the
precincts of the Vatican, whose outer
gates are guarded by the cut-throats
of the Revolution. Arms, money,
diplomacy, newspapers, and the telegraphic
wires are in the hands of the
enemy who besieges him before the
tomb of S. Peter, and who uses them
as far as possible to his injury. The
artifices, conspiracies, calumnies, outrages,
and insults of the Revolution
succeed each other like waves on a
tempestuous sea. And to make them
more exquisitely atrocious, the greater
number are hurled at him with the
absurd protest that his inviolability
is guaranteed by the majesty of
the laws.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Literally speaking, no other arms
are left to the Holy Father than his
constancy and his word; but it is a
constancy that makes the enemy despair,
and a word that confounds
him. That apostolic breast is inaccessible
to seduction, those august
lips are inexhaustible of truth. He
boldly defines theft to be theft, injustice
to be injustice, tyranny to be
tyranny; his language does not
change with the times, nor to suit
any one whomsoever. In condemning
crimes and reproving villany, he
has no respect for persons. He
fears the powerful no more than the
faint-hearted. He does not suffer
himself to be deluded by the promises
or dismayed by the threats of
those who boast innumerable armies
and glory in formidable artillery.
The heart of Pius IX. is undaunted
by the flash of swords and the thunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
of cannon. The Revolution, unable
to shake the firmness or chain
the tongue of Piux IX., regards him
with a shuddering admiration, and
exalts with demoniac yells his superhuman
power.</p>

<p>In very truth, a strange case! We
see a victim and an assassin. The
victim has only the moral strength
of dignity and right: the assassin is
opulent in brute force; yet the victim
does not tremble before the assassin,
but the assassin before the
victim. The Revolution does not
make Pius IX. turn pale: Pius IX.
intimidates the Revolution. A rebuke
from the victim strikes sharper
terror into the assassin than the
whole arsenal of the assassin can infuse
into the victim.</p>

<p>This fact alone, in our opinion, is
a striking proof that the Papacy is
divine in origin, in its prerogatives,
its life, its activity, its manifestation.
The mysterious power which, with
the simple virtue of a <i>non possumus</i>
and a <i>non licet</i>, it exercises on earth,
proves that God speaks in it, and its
word proceeds from the Word of
truth. What other mere mortal
could by his own power produce effects
so great with arguments so
slight? A motto of Napoleon I. intimidated
whole nations, because at his
beck armed men stood forth and always
victorious: his power was founded
on iron and in blood. But on what
soldiery rests the word of the Vicar
of Christ, imprisoned in the Vatican?
What invasion, what battle, can be
dreaded as the result of a <i>non possumus</i>
and a <i>non licet</i> of Pius IX.? Yet
these words, uttered by his lips, strike
perplexity into the leaders of all
Revolutionary armies. How explain
this wonder without admitting that
the strength of Pius IX. is God’s
strength? And after that, how deny
that the stupendous greatness of the
Roman Pontificate never shone more
gloriously than now, whilst Pope
Pius, in the name of the King of
kings, and of the Lord of lords,
<i>pugnat gladio oris sui</i>,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> strikes with
the sword of the Word, and conquers
the satanic hydra of the insolent
Revolution?</p>

<h3 class="p2">IV</h3>

<p>The assailants of the Papacy are
wont to say, in their own praise, that
the Vatican has for its adversaries
the most enlightened, cultivated, and
virtuous men of our time. We, on
the contrary, see the very opposite.
With certain exceptions, including
the blind, the dull, and the deluded,
in the throng of declared enemies
of the Roman Pontificate, we find
only the moral dregs of society.
There are great and small, of course,
but, when put to a moral test, they
are all equal, one as good as another,
unless, indeed, the great are worth
less than the small. In the throng,
there are heretics without a creed,
Jews without a Testament, atheists
without a God, and Catholics without
laws. We find deserters from every
flag&mdash;those who betray their masters,
and bite the hands of benefactors;
doubled-faced deceivers&mdash;men who
have instigated horrible massacres, and
flattered every social crime; men guilty
of infamous sacrilege, awful rapine,
nefarious murders. We see corruptors
of the people&mdash;burglars, brawlers,
bombarders of harmless cities, mercenary
writers, vendors of honor, protectors
of evil haunts, worshippers of
luxury. We notice all the apostates
from the church and the priesthood:
renegade Christians, silenced priests,
unfrocked friars. We see men who
insult God, disturb civil order, tear
down thrones, cheat and defraud
their neighbor&mdash;in short, men who
blaspheme against the faith, and trample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
on the Ten Commandments.
There is no kind of sectarian, from
the most stupid of Freemasons to
the most brutal of communists, that
does not make part of this crowd of
enlightened, cultivated, virtuous men
of the present age.</p>

<p>The Prophet Daniel contemplated,
in four shadowy, mysterious creatures,
not only the four great monarchies
of the earth, but the four
great persecutions to which Christ’s
church would be subjected in the
course of ages. The interpreters of
this acceptation of the vision agree
in saying that the first, symbolized
by the lioness, meant the persecution
of Gentiles so cruelly prosecuted by
the Roman Cæsars; the second, denoted
by the bear, that of heretics;
the third, represented by the leopard,
that of false Christians; and the last,
figured by a nameless creature awfully
hideous, that of Antichrist, and
so designated because, <i>in ea erit
omnium perversitatum concursus</i>, it
shall contain in itself the wickedness
of the three preceding ones.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>It is, indeed, difficult to decide
whether the terrible and universal
persecution which the Catholic
Church is now sustaining, especially
in the person of the Sovereign Pontiff,
should be referred to the third as
its completion, or to the fourth as its
preparation. When we consider the
quality of the persecutors, they are
undoubtedly false Christians, and
worthy to be compared in ferocious
malice to the leopard. But when we
see in them the union of all perversity
united to slay the church in its head,
we suspect that the present is, indeed,
a preparation for that final persecution
which must forerun the consummation
of the human race.</p>

<p>However that may be, it is beyond
controversy that the persecution of
to-day bears all the marks of Antichristianity,
and that its promoters,
followers, and accomplices accord
with the description given by the
apostle S. Paul to his disciple and
Timothy. We give the text, let him
deny it who can:</p>

<p>“Know also this, that, in the
last days, shall come dangerous
times.</p>

<p>“Men shall be lovers of themselves,
covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers,
disobedient to parents, ungrateful,
wicked,</p>

<p>“Without affection, without peace,
slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful,
without kindness,</p>

<p>“Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and
lovers of pleasures more than of God;”
and the following verses.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Now, if, according to the proverb,
the vituperations of the wicked are
praise, is it not glory for the Papacy
to see unchained against it to-day all
the malice of the world, and to be
lashed by all that Christendom holds
in its bosom most odious, despotic,
base, and abominable? Is not this the
highest summit of grandeur? Is it
not an unexampled participation in
the glories of Christ?</p>

<h3 class="p2">V.</h3>

<p>The more startling the contrast of
opposite qualities in those who love
and are faithful to the Papacy, the
more must we admire them. To the
moral dregs of society we see opposed
the very flower of good men
of every condition and in every country;
not only among Catholic Christians,
but among Protestants and
schismatics, and even among Turks,
Jews, and the barbarians of Asia. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
vain does the Revolution try to vilify
with terms of reproach those who are
devoted to the Pope and to his
sacred rights. It cannot prevent
them from being what they are&mdash;an
honor to the world, and the support
of justice. It is impossible to be sincere,
to understand clearly the significance
of the cause defended by the
Papacy, and not feel for it love and
veneration. For this end it is not
necessary to have supernatural faith,
and to belong to the fold of the
church: the light of reason, human
understanding, are sufficient. Reason
and sense make it clear to the least
astute minds that the Pontiff is now
defending all order, every right, every
social law, against an enemy who
hates God in humanity, and every
good of God in the good of mankind.</p>

<p>The ardor of Catholics all over the
world for Pius IX., and the close
union of the whole ecclesiastical hierarchy
with his see, constitute a plain
and lasting fact which will surely be
the greatest glory of this age in the
annals of Christianity. It is a glory
due chiefly to the Revolution, which
has been providentially permitted and
ordained by God, chiefly for the end
of better strengthening and confirming
unity in the hierarchy of his
church. The result has been an
exaltation of Papal authority among
Christian nations so new and striking
that it now forms a large part of the
strength with which the Papacy repels
the attacks of the Revolution, and
promises to surpass before long the
effective power which it possessed in
the middle ages of our era. The complication
of events leads nations to
recognize in the Roman Pontificate
the sole anchor of safety left to them
in these tempests raised by the Revolution.
We may say that an irresistible
power is little by little
bringing them to seek refuge in
this asylum. Not only has the Pontiff’s
voice found a wonderful echo in
the soul of peoples, but his sacred
person is oppressed, so to speak, with
demonstrations of faith and love more
solemnly magnificent than could be
imagined. The voluntary tribute
of blood has been and is offered to
him by thousands of valiant men;
that of gold is constantly given to
him by millions of the faithful. He
is truly the most beloved, praised, and
honored among men. In our time,
there is no name of magnate or of
king which ranks so high as the name
of Pius IX.</p>

<p>It is true that governments occupied
almost everywhere by the Revolution
strongly oppose, with a thousand
corrupting and despotic artifices,
this movement of nations towards
the Papacy; but all in vain. The
wind blows from that quarter, and it
is a wind that crushes, sweeps, and
grinds to powder all impediments.
See how rapidly the deeds and men
of the Revolution succeed each other
in the nations oppressed by it; the
instability of its kingdoms, the fragility
of its empires, the fickleness of its
victories, the inanity of its statistics,
the weakness of its institutions; all
about it is variable, changeable, inconstant:
the buildings of yesterday
crumble to-day.</p>

<p>This is because its satanic power is
that of a meteor, not of a star; it
appears, falls to ruin, and disappears.
The power of the Papacy, on the
contrary, is a sun which does not pass
away, but lives; and the vivid
flashes which it sends through the
clouds gathering around the Revolution
already show that the meteor is
about to break and melt away.</p>

<h3 class="p2">VI.</h3>

<p>Yes, the present greatness of the
Roman Pontificate, impersonated in
Pius IX., the visible pole of all social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
order in this world, the terror of bad
hearts, and joy of upright souls&mdash;this
glory is only the first gleam of that
which his heroic and lingering passion
is preparing for an approaching
future.</p>

<p>For the comfort, meanwhile, of the
weak and timid, we repeat, with the
more sagacious minds of our own
day, that the future is for the Papacy,
not for the Revolution; that the Papacy
has already conquered the Revolution.
We will conclude by making
our own those noble words upon
the immortal youth of the Church,
spoken by our Holy Father to the
representatives of the Catholic youth
of Italy, on Epiphany of this year, in
the Vatican. We accommodate them
with perfect propriety to the supreme
office of the Vicariate of Christ, with
which he is divinely invested, and
which he so gloriously sustains in the
presence of God, of angels, of men,
and of the infernal Revolution itself:</p>

<p>“My sons, let us give battle, and
fear nothing. Remember that the
enemies of God are vanishing, and
the Papacy remains. The Child
Jesus fled into Egypt, but in the
night-time he was told to return,
‘for they are dead who sought the
life of the child.’ How many persecutors
of the Papacy are dead!
After giving vent to their fury, and
decimating the faithful who served
God, they are dead: and the Papacy
is left. Yes; <i>ipsi peribunt</i>, but thou,
beloved Peter, living in thy successors&mdash;thou,
constituted by God his
vicar on earth&mdash;thou remainest, and
thou shalt always remain: <i>ipsi peribunt,
tu autem permanebis</i>. Thou
shalt remain, young, vigorous, constant,
in contrast to the persecutions
which purify the church, whose head
thou art, wash away its every spot,
and make it stronger. <i>Ipsi peribunt,
tu autem permanebis.</i> Thou art still
with us in the teaching of truth and
morals, in many ways, under many
appearances. <i>Ipsi peribunt, sed tu
permanebis.</i></p>

<p>“Let this be our consolation, our
comfort, our faith. Let us feel assured
that <i>ipsi peribunt, Petrus autem
permanebit usque in finem sæculorum</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>And you, great Pontiff, in uttering
these sublime words, little thought
that, three days later, he would perish
suddenly who for many years had
been the treacherous tormentor of
the Papacy in your august person.</p>

<p>Napoleon III. perished uncrowned,
humbled, in exile; that Napoleon
who, in the intoxication of his empty
triumphs, thought to hold in his hand,
after your death, the victory over
the Roman See, <i>periit</i>. He died, let
us hope, repentant; and you, Holy
Father, survive him to pray for his
peace after death, with the same
generous soul that, like your divine
Model on Golgotha, always pardoned
him in life. He has vanished like
a shadow, first from the greatest
throne in Europe, then from the
sight of men, <i>periit</i>; and the Papacy
<i>permanet</i> in you more than ever
invincible. You, Pope Pius, for the
time a prisoner, continue, from the Vatican,
with Christ and in Christ, to
reign beloved, blessed, applauded,
over all who have a believing heart,
an upright soul. Napoleon III. has
gone down to that city of the dead
which shall form the pedestal of your
greatness in all ages: <i>scabellum pedum
tuorum</i>; peopled by beings like
Cavour, Palmerston, Mazzini, and
by a throng of many others, who
girded their loins for the mad enterprise
of crushing out in his Vicar
Christ our God, King of Heaven
and Earth.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c408" id="c408">“FOR BETTER&mdash;FOR WORSE.”</a></h2>

<p class="pc1 reduct">CONCLUDED.</p>

<p class="p2">“<span class="smcap">Pray</span> take an easier chair, Mrs.
Vanderlyn,” says the invalid; “I
thank you for your sympathy, and
trust my cough has not disturbed
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! not at all,” says Agnes; “it
only made me want to come to see
you, and I hope you will not regard
it as an intrusion on my part.”</p>

<p>“By no means. You are very
kind. I see it in your eyes. You
do not shun the sick. It is a good
heart that leads you to me. I thank
you.”</p>

<p>These words are interrupted by
painful coughing, but, after the paroxysm
has passed, she becomes more
quiet, and Agnes has a better opportunity
of studying her face while they
converse.</p>

<p>In spite of her wasting disease, it is
a beautiful and <i>saintly</i> face still, and
evidently has been much more beautiful
in health and youth. Refinement
and purity are stamped on every feature,
and in every gesture and every
fold of her raiment. The small, thin
hands, folded over the book in her
lap, are those of a delicately bred lady.
A heavy plain gold ring, on the third
finger of her left hand, is so loose that
it is guarded by another and smaller
one. These are all the ornaments
she wears. A soft, warm wrapper of
brown merino, a little white cap of
thin muslin which does not altogether
hide her abundant dark hair, are all
of feminine costume to tell of the
wearer’s character.</p>

<p>The room is very neat and comfortable,
and shows no sign of poverty.
On the walls are a few wood engravings,
mostly of religious subjects, and
a few photograph portraits finished in
oils. A crucifix stands on the mantel,
and a smaller one, attached to a
rosary of Roman pearls, on the table
by her side, where also is an exquisite
Parian statuette of the Blessed
Virgin and Child. Agnes sits on the
other side of this table, and, while
she converses with her hostess, her
attention is drawn to a small book
lying near her. Apparently only to
read the title, she takes up this book,
and opens at the fly-leaf. It is a
prayer-book, and, in a lady’s writing,
she reads:</p>

<p>“Martin Vanderlyn, from his wife.”
Although prepared to know the truth,
almost knowing it before she came
into the room, Agnes feels her cheeks
and lips grow pale; but she has always
great command of herself, and
now has not been taken quite by surprise.</p>

<p>“My husband is not a Catholic,
although that book bears his name,”
says Mrs. Vanderlyn. “Perhaps he
is a relative of yours,” she adds, looking
inquiringly at her guest.</p>

<p>“I never heard my husband speak
of any relative of that name,” Agnes
says. “The name is not a very common
one, either. It seems strange that
two of us should meet here. Is your
husband absent?” She has remarked
that Mrs. Vanderlyn had said, “My
husband is not a Catholic,” and the
avoidance of the use of the past tense
gives her the chance to put her question,
which she does to cover her own
confusion, and mislead the lady as to
herself. An expression of pain passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
over Mrs. Vanderlyn’s face, as she
quietly replies:</p>

<p>“Yes; he is absent, travelling.” It
is not the first time that the poor lady
has been obliged to answer a similar
question, so she is not much disturbed;
but Agnes feels sorry she has asked
it. Mrs. Vanderlyn goes on speaking
of her increased indisposition:
“Mr. Vanderlyn does not know how
very rapid has been the progress of
the disease. I am much worse now
than when he left home.”</p>

<p>Agnes cannot find it in her heart to
ask how long it is since he left her.
She thinks she knows, and she thinks
she understands that Mrs. Vanderlyn
does not wish her to know that she
is a divorced woman. She respects
this as a delicacy of feeling which
her own position fully teaches her to
appreciate. With her present knowledge
of Martin Vanderlyn as a husband,
her sympathies are all with his
wife. She believes now that it was
his fault and not hers which made
the trouble between them. Her
strong good sense tells her that Mrs.
Vanderlyn being a Catholic was no
sufficient reason for his separating
from her; and she cannot believe
that this lady has been a disagreeable
companion to live with.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with all the thoughts
surging in her mind, she soon takes
her leave, all the sooner that she hears
her boy calling to her.</p>

<p>“You have a little son,” Mrs.
Vanderlyn remarks. “Will you not
bring him in to see me? I am very
fond of children, and the only one I
had is dead; I shall soon meet her,
I hope. But to-morrow you will
bring your boy to see me, will you
not?” And she holds her hand out
to Agnes, and looks wistfully in her
face. Agnes is touched almost to
tears as she promises.</p>

<p>The next day, with her “curled
darling” clinging to her skirts, she
goes to see this <i>sister</i>, as she somehow
feels Mrs. Vanderlyn to be to
her. Are they not both the deserted
wives of the same man? And she
feels that this one is more truly the
wife than herself, in spite of all the
law can do for her. And it has not
escaped her notice that Mrs. Vanderlyn
spoke of Martin as her husband
still.</p>

<p>As she approaches Mrs. Vanderlyn,
little George is hiding his face in her
skirts, only allowing himself to look
out, from time to time, between his
fingers, at the lady. No urging from
his mother seems likely to get him
out of his intrenchment.</p>

<p>“Let him alone,” Mrs. Vanderlyn
says; “that is the way with many
children. When we stop urging him,
he will show himself of his own accord.”</p>

<p>And so he does. After the attention
of the two is, as he supposes,
removed from himself, the chubby
fingers come down, and the bright
eyes gaze steadily at Mrs. Vanderlyn.
She, becoming aware of this, turns,
saying, “What is your name, darling?”</p>

<p>“Martin Van’lyn,” proudly speaks
out little George, using the name by
which his father had nearly always
called him, and which he now seems
to choose in a spirit of sheer mischief,
for Agnes has rarely called him by
that name. She had opposed it because
it confused the address she
used for his father. The child
speaks out the “Martin” with unusual
distinctness too, although he
has oftener called himself “Marty”
than Martin. Agnes has never
thought of the boy thus betraying
her, and she has said truly that his
name is George. She is confused,
and looks distressed, feeling that Mrs.
Vanderlyn will naturally suspect her
of falsifying, if not much more.</p>

<p>That lady seems equally disturbed,
but in a different way from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
which the child’s blunder might be
supposed to create. She pauses,
stammers, and, in great agitation,
looking at Agnes, exclaims:</p>

<p>“<i>Whose</i> child is this? I could
almost think I had my own again!
Holy Mother, help me!” Then
reaching for a little velvet miniature
case, she opens it with trembling
fingers, saying, “Look at that!”</p>

<p>Agnes looks, and sees the face of
a child nearly the age of her own,
which is so good a likeness of George
that it might be taken for him.
What wonder? It is the picture of
his half-sister. These children of the
same father had inherited a resemblance
to his family rather than to
himself, and here is little George
looking at Mrs. Vanderlyn with the
eyes and smile of her own child.
Who has not observed how wonderfully
lineage will proclaim itself in
this way? The poor lady is more
overcome by this sight than by any
question as to George’s name; but
that has not escaped her notice.
She lays her wasted hand on the
arm of Agnes, and says appealingly:</p>

<p>“Tell me the name of this child’s
father! Pardon me! See, I will
tell you first why I ask, that you
may know why I take this liberty
with you. I am Martin Vanderlyn’s
deserted wife. This is his child’s
face, and that is your child. He
says his name is Martin. Pardon
me, dear lady, again, for asking. I
do not wish to pain you as I am pained;
but what that man did to one
woman he may have done to another&mdash;deserted
her. I have heard that
he did deceive another, and married
her. I had not believed it, because
he came to me for money within the
past year, and spoke of returning to
me after he had done travelling. I
could not believe he had pretended
to marry another woman; but with
this” (pointing to the picture and to
the boy), “you see I cannot help believing
it. Are you that unfortunate
woman?”</p>

<p>She speaks with tender commiseration
for Agnes rather than with any
animosity toward her. Agnes has
stood during all this time, with her
hands nervously clutching her dress,
and vainly trying to be composed.
Of what need, after all, is concealment
from this woman, evidently not
long for this life, and so full of pity
and forgiveness? So she answers:</p>

<p>“You have rightly guessed. This
is Martin Vanderlyn’s son, and I am
what you truly call that unfortunate
woman whom he has deserted. But
I knew you immediately to be his
divorced wife.”</p>

<p>“Divorced! who says so? No; I
am not <i>that</i>. He would have made
me so, but I am a Catholic, and I
would not consent to it. I <i>could</i> not.
He is my husband still, and, while I
live, no law can make another woman
his wife. But, oh! this is too
cruel to you!” she says, seeing
Agnes droop at once. “Did you
really believe, dear, that you had
the law on your side? You thought
he was divorced from me. Ah! no;
not even that doubtful right had he
to marry you. He has not even the
Protestant permission, for he is not
divorced from me. Even if the law
had so parted us, he ought not to
have married another, and I, as a
Catholic, <i>could not</i> do so; for you remember
our Lord’s words that “he
who shall marry her that is put away,
committeth adultery.” I pain you,
madam, very much, I know, but I
must not deceive you more than
you have been deceived already.
I have not much longer to live, and
I must speak truth. If he ever
returns to you, as I once hoped he
would return to me, I may be in my
grave then. Beg him, in that case,
to marry you, else you will never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
his wife. I say this for your good.
I am sure you cannot think it is in
malice. Look at me. I have nearly
done with this life&mdash;above all, with
Martin Vanderlyn. You have shown
me kindness. I say to you what I
do now, that you may see to it that
no more wrong in the sight of
Heaven is done. I cannot look into
your face, and think that you will
live with him again while I live.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, no! God forbid!” cried
Agnes. “I am not <i>that</i>, I could not
be!”</p>

<p>“Then see to it when I am dead,”
says Mrs. Vanderlyn, and she sinks
back exhausted in her chair. Agnes
kneels before her, and does everything
in her power to restore her; but, in
the meantime, her own condition is
almost as pitiable. Little George
has got hold of Mrs. Vanderlyn’s
rosary, and is quietly playing with it
during all this time. When Mrs.
Vanderlyn is more composed, Agnes
gives way herself. Drawing her boy
to her heart, she cries:</p>

<p>“Oh! what am I, and what is he?
What is our name, and what can we
call ourselves? Can a few words more
or less from judge or jury thus disgrace
us? If I am not his wife, what
am I? God knows I insisted on
marriage with him, and entered upon
it in good faith.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt you,” Mrs. Vanderlyn
says gently. “But, my dear,
call yourself by your own name again.
Try to put yourself, as far as possible,
back into your old life, until you can
get him to make it right.”</p>

<p>Alas! she little knows how these
words pierce Agnes, and enlighten
her as to the great wrong that has
been done. Her own name again?
Why, what is it? Not Thorndyke
now. Her old life! She shall</p>

<p>
“Hear the ‘Never, never,’ whispered by the phantom years.”<br />
</p>

<p>Another woman fills her place, closed
now for ever to her, even if she could
wish to take it. No honored wife
can she be now; only a dishonored
woman, deceived, betrayed, deserted.
Her child without a father’s
name to call his own&mdash;in the eyes of
the law, “nobody’s child.” Where
shall she go? What shall she do?
To earn their bread she expected,
but she had not thought to do it in
disgrace. The two women weep together,
Mrs. Vanderlyn trying to
comfort Agnes, who now tells all her
former history to this new and strange
friend. Strange, indeed, that to Martin
Vanderlyn’s true wife this shameful
story should be confessed by his
victim; but Agnes feels that she has
not a wiser, kinder friend.</p>

<p>“Oh! where shall I go? What
shall I do!” she sobs, with her head
in Mrs. Vanderlyn’s lap.</p>

<p>“My dear, if you were a Catholic,
I should answer: ‘Go to your confessor.’
As it is, could you not seek
advice of your pastor? What kind
of Protestant are you, dear?”</p>

<p>“Alas! I have no pastor. I <i>was</i>
a Presbyterian. I am nothing now.
<i>He</i> destroyed all my faith.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I can well believe it;
only a faith rooted deep as mine is,
and as invulnerable, could withstand
his assaults,” Mrs. Vanderlyn says
sadly. “But, my poor child, you
need some counsel wiser than I can
give you, and a strength greater than
your own or mine to lean upon in
this sore trial. Are you too prejudiced
to let me bespeak for you the aid
of my own pastor, F. Francis? Our
fates seem so to meet in this great
trouble of our lives (though I know
yours is the greater burthen) that I
feel sure F. Francis will give you the
advice and consolation you need.”</p>

<p>Agnes is startled at the proposition,
but it does not repel her as it once
would have done. This much, at
least, unbelief will do for its victims,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
if they have been Protestant&mdash;it destroys
that intense prejudice against
the Catholic clergy which is the very
life of Protestantism. Indeed, it
often ploughs up the soil of the mind,
and roots out the weeds of prejudice
and bigotry, leaving a fair chance for
the seeds of the true faith to find root.
Agnes has been a very thoughtful
woman, and has often suspected that
there must be some divine influence
in the Catholic religion to bind its
believers to it, and to sustain them
as she has seen no others held and
sustained. In Mrs. Vanderlyn, she
has perceived, through all her own
perplexity and grief, a marked example
of this divine assistance. Now
that the way is open, she feels a
yearning to lay hold of the same support.
It is the desperate groping of
a despairing soul for something beyond
itself. Moreover, she has seen
the gentle face of F. Francis, and
heard the kind tones of his voice. So
she answers humbly:</p>

<p>“If he will let me, Protestant as I
am, trouble him with my affairs, I
would be indeed glad to have his advice.
He must be often called to
comfort distressed Catholics, who
keep nothing back from their priests.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he is&mdash;none oftener.
Then I will tell your part of this sad
story to him first. He, of course,
knows mine already. What shall I
call you to him, dear? You will be
Mrs. Thorndyke still to him and to
me, but you may not like to hear the
name from us, and we must designate
you.”</p>

<p>“Call me Agnes Rodney&mdash;my father’s
name may yet be mine. This
is the second time I have taken it
back. I gave my boy that name.
Poor child! He has no other
now.”</p>

<p>The boy has been sleeping on
the pillows of a sofa for some time,
happily hidden from Mrs. Vanderlyn’s
sight by the back of his mother’s
chair. As he turns now in his
sleep, Agnes rouses him, and leads
him from the room.</p>

<p>On the following day, Agnes is
asked by a servant to come to Mrs.
Vanderlyn’s room. She suspects
that it is to meet F. Francis, and she
is not mistaken. It is not so great a
trial to her as she has feared, for
Mrs. Vanderlyn has told the story
first to him.</p>

<p>From this interview she goes with a
chastened spirit, and yet with more of
comfort than she has thought it possible
for her to feel. He has not
spared her in the matter of how
much she has been blamable all
through her trials in not bearing
with her husband more patiently and
dutifully, and, above all, in tampering
with divorce. He has shown her
how the church regards marriage:
not as a civil contract, but as a sacrament;
and that, in his eyes, she is
still John Thorndyke’s wife. So the
wish of Mrs. Vanderlyn that Martin
might be persuaded to legally marry
Agnes after her own death, could
not be granted while Agnes had yet a
husband. True, the <i>law</i> has freed
her from that tie, but no Catholic
could bid her take any such advantage.
Moreover, it is very doubtful
if she will ever see Vanderlyn again.
No thought of pursuit or of punishment
ever enters her mind. To
work for herself and her boy is now
all that is left for her, and F. Francis
promises to try to find that work for
her to do. In the meantime, it is arranged
that she shall stay for the
present with Mrs. Vanderlyn, making
no difference in her name to the
landlady, to whom she says that they
have discovered that they are remotely
connected.</p>

<p>“I guessed it would turn out so,”
says the landlady, “and I am right
glad the poor soul has found a friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
I think she grows worse very fast.
She won’t last long.”</p>

<p>The landlady is not wrong in her
conclusions. From this time, Agnes
devotes herself to the care of Mrs.
Vanderlyn in her fast-failing strength.
Indeed, did Agnes not fill the place of
nurse, a hired one would be necessary,
for the invalid has no relatives
in the country upon whom to call.
She was an only child, and her father
the only one left of his family.
From him she has inherited a small
competence which has placed her
above want and above the need of
trying to wring from her husband
any support. It was this which
tempted him to come so meanly to
her, even while living with Agnes,
for pecuniary aid, well knowing, as
he did, her generous nature.</p>

<p>It is a loving, but short task for
Agnes to perform. In little more than
three months, Margaret Vanderlyn is
dead. But what a missionary even on
her dying bed she has proved herself!
Agnes sees now what it was that
gave the angelic patience, and lent
such a glory to the last days of her
friend. Day by day, she has been
necessarily thrown within the influence
and teaching of F. Francis. The
soil has indeed been ready, and, after
Mrs. Vanderlyn’s burial, she feels, in
her desolate condition, that only in
the bosom of kind Mother Church
is there any consolation for her.
Perhaps, too, the desire to get as far
as possible from all the infidel tendencies
and teachings which Vanderlyn
had brought to bear upon her
mind makes her turn to the church
as the surest and safest refuge. So
Agnes Rodney becomes a Catholic,
and a sincere one. As she kisses the
crucifix, which was Mrs. Vanderlyn’s,
she feels that she is a Magdalen, and
longs to pour some precious ointment
over her Saviour’s feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderlyn has left nearly all
of her property to Agnes, not only as
an acknowledgment of untiring devotion
in her last days, but as some
amends for the wrong done to her by
Martin Vanderlyn. No finer proof
of Margaret’s noble heart could have
been given than in this generosity to
the woman who had supplanted her.</p>

<p>But Agnes cannot rest content in
the ease thus afforded her. She feels
that she does not deserve it. She
longs to make some greater expiation
than any she has yet offered for
the error of her life. A Magdalen
she seems always to herself. It is
this feeling which culminates at last
in a desire to make the devotion of
all her energies, and the sacrifice
of all ease the precious ointment to
pour at his feet. With this thought,
she goes to F. Francis, and proposes
to place her boy in a Catholic asylum,
and that she may become a religious
in some severe order.</p>

<p>“My daughter, it must not be,” replies
the good priest sadly.</p>

<p>“Why not, father? I will strive
so hard; I think I can be steadfast,
with God’s help, after all I have endured.
It would be such a blessed
refuge, too, from my name and from
my sad place in life&mdash;perhaps too
great a privilege for me,” she adds,
watching the unconsenting look in
F. Francis’ eyes.</p>

<p>“You have said it, my child,” he
replies. “Those who wear that
garb have never been in your doubtful
position. Besides, your husband
lives.”</p>

<p>Agnes’ face falls. She never
thinks of herself now as a married
woman.</p>

<p>“But if I should become a real
widow ever?” she pleads; for the
purpose is dear to her, and she has
hoped that her boy can be made a
priest.</p>

<p>“Even then,” says F. Francis,
“that which was your relation to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
Vanderlyn would be in the way of
your reception into any of these orders,
and your boy’s birth would be
an impediment to his entering the
priesthood.”</p>

<p>Never before has Agnes felt how
great has been her degradation as
now, when she finds that the all-pitying,
loving, and gentle church
which has washed her sins and granted
her comfort and hope has yet its
reservations for such as she and her
boy.</p>

<p>It may be taken as a proof of the
thoroughness of her conversion that
she so meekly acquiesces.</p>

<p>“But, my daughter, I will tell you
what you may do, if you feel like devoting
yourself. We will put George
in an asylum, and educate him, and
by-and-by we will find his place for
him; and you can go into a hospital
as nurse.”</p>

<p>Her face brightens.</p>

<p>“You may not be a real sister;
but a good hospital nurse, braving
all contagion, and discomfort, and fatigue,
is the next thing to one; and
you may fashion your garb plainly,
and shun the world’s comforts and
pleasures very effectually in such a
calling.”</p>

<p>“I will, father! Oh, I will!”
she says with warmth, for this is her
true vocation. “And then I may
not have to part from George entirely,
which, after all, would wound me
<i>here</i>.” She lays her hand upon her
heart as she speaks. “He is the
only tie that is left me now.”</p>

<p>So Agnes Rodney watches beside
the sick and dying in a hospital.
Dressed in a plain brown gown, with
her hair drawn under a simple white
cap, she looks almost a real “sister,”
and many of her Protestant patients
think her such. She is happier now
than ever since her girlhood. She
is doing her Saviour’s work and
that which she has always loved&mdash;ministering
to the sick. No other
nurse throws into her work such tender,
loving care, such sympathy for
the homeless and friendless. The
doctors rely upon her skill; the patients
love her for her gentle ministrations.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“And slow, as in a dream of bliss,<br />
The speechless sufferer turns to kiss</p>
<p class="pp8i">Her shadow, as it falls</p>
<p class="pp8i">Upon the darkening walls.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is some five years from the time
when Agnes Rodney commenced
this life, that a young man, indeed
scarcely more than a youth, for he
cannot be more than nineteen, is
hurt by a fall from a scaffold, and
brought into the hospital. He is a
carpenter, and has been at work on
an adjoining building. To care for
him, Mrs. Rodney is sent. The
youth is unconscious at first, and under
the surgeon’s hands. She does
not learn his name at once, and it
seems as if no one knows it. His
fellow-workmen have withdrawn for
the time, but will return to-morrow.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Rodney is disposing
of this youth, washing and removing
superfluous clothing, a pocket-book
falls from his pockets, opening, and
scattering its contents. She gathers
these up, and is returning them, when
her eye falls on a little picture which
makes her start and gaze curiously
at the youth on the bed before her.
This picture is of a woman much
younger than herself, and fairer, but
it is her own likeness, nevertheless,
taken many years ago. The face has
a sweet girlish look, and soft, dark
ringlets hang about the white throat.
Her own hair is now more gray than
dark, and stern lines are traced about
the eyes and mouth; yet something
of the same expression characterizes
the face of the picture and the face
of the hospital nurse. How many
changes have come in her life since
the sun portrayed that girlish face!
How well she remembers sitting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
it years ago! She gazes at it now,
and criticises it, as if it were that of
another person&mdash;never of herself.
So completely changed does she
seem to herself that no feeling has
she now in common with the girl in
the picture. And yet she knows it
so well. Who is this youth who carries
it about him? Is it for a chance
admiration of it? She knows this
may be, for it is the picture of a very
pretty girl of about his own age. She
almost fears to allow herself to believe
who he may be as she scans
his face closely. He moans and
opens his eyes, turning to her, saying:</p>

<p>“Please give me some water.”</p>

<p>She gives it, and asks, with a quiet
voice, but with eyes and ears expectant
of the answer:</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“George Thorndyke, ma’am.” And
Agnes knows that her own son lies
before her. How anxiously, for many
days and nights after this, does she
devote herself to this patient! No
wonder the boy grows to be very
fond of her? To him she is only
Mrs. Rodney, and he has connected
no idea of his mother with that
name, although it has been his middle
name also. His father struck it
out, and he does not even know his
mother’s maiden name. During his
illness, she, by little and little, gleans
this from him&mdash;that his father is
dead; that he has three sisters
(she sighs to herself as she remembers
the other two); that he is
working with a carpenter, of whom
he is learning his trade; that his
“<i>stepmother</i>” has been always good to
him, but that she is gone, since his
father’s death, to live far away. This
explains one thing which has puzzled
her&mdash;that only his employer and
fellow-workmen have come to see
him in the hospital. She has feared
every day that some of his family
might come. One thing yet she
yearns to know&mdash;does he know any
thing of herself, or does he think her
dead? She longs and yet dreads to
know this. At last, when it is evident
that he will soon be well enough
to leave the hospital, she asks him if
he remembers his own mother, or
if he was too young when he “<i>lost
her</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; I remember her a
very little; but I have got her picture
in my pocket-book.” And he shows
it to her.</p>

<p>“This was taken when she was
very young, I should think,” says
the nurse.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; mother said, the day she
found it, that she guessed it was a
keepsake of father’s once, but that
she thought I had the best right to
it. She told me never to let him see
it, or know I had it, and that’s the
reason I got to carrying it around
with me. Why, nurse, I think she
had eyes like yours.”</p>

<p>The nurse smiles, and busies herself
in such a way that her head is
turned away for some moments.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think she was pretty,
nurse? <i>I</i> do?” continued Thorndyke.</p>

<p>Thus challenged, Agnes looks critically
at the little picture.</p>

<p>“Yes; she <i>was</i> pretty, I think,” she
answers slowly; “but, if she had lived,
she might have been no better-looking
than I am now.”</p>

<p>“And that would be nice enough
for me; but, nurse, stoop down. I
want to tell you something. She
isn’t dead, or wasn’t when my father
married my stepmother. They think
that I think so, but a boy told me
that she went away, and was divorced.
I didn’t believe it at first, but I found
out that it was true, and I would so
much like to find her.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I believe it was father’s
own fault that she went away. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
may be wrong in me to say it, but I
know he could be hateful sometimes,
and I think he never liked me so
well as he liked my sisters; and I
always thought my stepmother was
kinder to me than he was.”</p>

<p>“God bless her for that!”</p>

<p>Thorndyke looks at the nurse, surprised
at the earnestness of the
words.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” he says, encouraged
in his confidences by her sympathy.
“She was always good to me, but I
guess my own mother was superior
to her, and father knew it; but they
got along very well together, and she
was good to him when he was sick
at last.”</p>

<p>“Did he prosper?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite well; but what he left
wasn’t much, divided among four of
us, and mother’s share out. I’ll
have a little to start me with, though,
and I got good schooling.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” says the
nurse.</p>

<p>“Why, nurse, what an interest you
take in me; I think it very good of
you, indeed. Is it so with all the
poor fellows who get shut up here?”</p>

<p>“George Thorndyke, let me tell
you something which I <i>must</i> before
you go away and I lose all trace of
you. I knew that picture as soon as
I saw it, for I saw it before you were
born.”</p>

<p>“Then you knew my mother!
Where is she? Say! Is she living?”</p>

<p>“She is here. Can you forgive
her and love her?”</p>

<p>They are not alone, so this revelation
has to be made with hushed
voices and guarded manner; but
George Thorndyke says, grasping
her hands:</p>

<p>“I would rather you were my mother
than any woman I have ever met;
and I will work for you all the days
of my life.”</p>

<p>“No, George; this is my place,
and this is my work.”</p>

<p>“But you must come out of it;
you’ll get your death here. Gracious
goodness! I can’t take it all in!
Why, what a good thing it was for
me to get that tumble, as it led me
to you!”</p>

<p>And then he questions her very
much, and many of his questions are
hard to answer. At last he says
suddenly:</p>

<p>“But you’re a Catholic, are you
not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answers.</p>

<p>“Did that make the trouble,
mother?” And he looks as if he
thinks he has guessed it all.</p>

<p>“No, my son; if I had been a
Catholic then, it would never have
happened, and I should never have
been here, and perhaps not you,
either.”</p>

<p>He refrains from any further questions,
but goes on declaring that he
will take her from there, and work
for her. It is pleasant to this lonely
woman to feel that here is a manly
heart and strength to lean on which
she may honestly claim, but she answers:</p>

<p>“No, George; I cannot allow it;
you must work, and take a wife, by-and-by,
to yourself. I have my
place and my work here, and there
is another for whom I work too.
But I have some money besides.
There is no need for you to work
for me, although I am here. Why,
I am almost rich.”</p>

<p>“Another?” he says curiously,
and scarcely noticing her last words.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she says, and has the pain
of blushing before her own son, as
she tells him he has a brother.
“There is another George who is
as near to you as those sisters of
whom you have told me. I named
him George to fill your place, after
the law gave you to your father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
not to me. O my son! I never
meant to leave <i>you</i>. God knows I
did not.”</p>

<p>“I do believe that,” he said; “but
keep quiet, or they’ll notice. Where
is&mdash;my&mdash;brother?” There is a slight
hesitation over the last word&mdash;ever
so slight&mdash;and he puts it bravely, but
she feels it. That nice sense of motherhood
has always been so quick
with her. In all her vicissitudes, it
has never been blunted. She tells
him where George Rodney is, and
asks if he wishes to see him.</p>

<p>“Yes; I do, for your sake; and,
besides, he is my namesake, and did
almost crowd me out, which I can’t
allow, you know. But&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;Mr.
Rodney living?”</p>

<p>Ah! what a keen although unconscious
thrust is that!</p>

<p>“Rodney is my maiden name,
George, and I have dropped the
other. The Catholic Church does
not recognize me as the wife of any
other than your father.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see,” he says, in evident
relief.</p>

<p>She goes bravely on to have it over:</p>

<p>“But little George’s father is gone
from us, I do not know where; I
never expect to see him again.
Rodney was in your name too,
George.”</p>

<p>“I never knew that,” he says.</p>

<p>“Well, let it pass; perhaps your
father did well to leave it out, and
your brother keeps it now.”</p>

<p>They are interrupted here, and the
nurse leaves her son, to attend to
other duties. He finds enough to
think about, and wants no other
company but his own thoughts.</p>

<p>It is not many days after this that
George Thorndyke leaves the hospital;
but he never lets a day pass
without going to see his mother, and
he meets his brother kindly, if not affectionately.
But to all his entreaties,
and for a long time, Agnes refuses
to leave her hard life. She
means to “die in the harness” which
she has voluntarily assumed. But at
last her health begins to fail with the
long strain upon her endurance,
and the doctors say she must rest.
F. Francis also counsels it. Now,
and not till now, does she allow her
son to make a home for her. It is a
very comfortable one, for, with the
money left her by Mrs. Vanderlyn,
added to her long-saved pay as a
hospital nurse, and George Thorndyke’s
wages in his trade, they live
in quiet refinement, if not luxury.
And Agnes Rodney is a happy mother
of two good sons.</p>

<p>A year has passed, and Agnes sits
on a ferry-boat, in company with
George Rodney, who is spending a
short vacation with her. They sit
near a man who is closely watching
them, but whom they do not observe.
This man has a sallow, unhealthy,
and dissipated face, but
withal a rather handsome one. The
hair is dark, the eyes are gray, but
sunken, and restless in their expression.
A very heavy beard covers
all the lower part of his face. A
broad-brimmed felt hat shades his
forehead and eyes. He seems very
curious about Agnes, and shifts his
seat, and leans nearer to hear her
voice every time she answers
George’s frequent questions. As
they pass from the boat, he hastens
to walk close behind her. He hears
her say to the boy, “Wait, <i>George</i>, not
so fast,” and his eye lights up at
something in these few words. The
mother and son get into a street-car.
The man follows them, but seats
himself on the same side, and at the
other end of the seat. He keeps his
head turned the other way whenever
Agnes appears likely to look in
his direction. He is at the end of
the car where she will not pass him
in leaving it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>When Agnes and George get off,
he follows quickly, still without their
noticing him. He sees the house
they enter, surveys the neighborhood,
repeats the number to himself,
and then walks up the street and
around the block, apparently in deep
thought. When he comes around
to the house again, he goes slowly
up the steps, and reads “Thorndyke”
upon the door. This seems to puzzle
him. He looks around the
neighborhood again.</p>

<p>“No; I am right,” he says; “that
is the church opposite, and this is
the number, but what does <i>this</i> name
mean! John Thorndyke is dead,
but she seems to prefer his name!
Well, I’ll just see.” And he rings
the bell.</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Thorndyke in?” he says
to the maid who opens the door.</p>

<p>“There hain’t no Mrs. Thorndyke,”
says the girl, taking it as a
personal grievance that he is not
aware of this fact.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, the lady of the house&mdash;Mrs.
Vanderlyn,” he says, not wishing
to appear too ignorant before
this austere damsel. Now she is exasperated.</p>

<p>“There hain’t nobody of <i>that</i>
name, neither; but isn’t it Mrs. Rodney
you want?”</p>

<p>The moment he hears this name,
he appears satisfied, and, without
noticing the girl’s rudeness, he says:</p>

<p>“That is the lady I mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s in.” And the girl waves
her hand to the open parlor door, as
if she disdains further words with
him. She suspects he hasn’t known
the name of Rodney at all before
she mentioned it. All his offence is
in asking a question which she has
been obliged to answer several times
before to pedlars and others of that
kind, but she visits upon him the accumulated
vexation caused by his
predecessors.</p>

<p>“<i>What name</i> shall <i>I</i> take to her?”
she asks, with an unpleasant emphasis,
as if she doubts whether he knows
his own name, or has any.</p>

<p>“What name? Ah! yes. Say
Mr. <i>Martin</i> would like to see her.”</p>

<p>The girl goes up-stairs, and tells
Mrs. Rodney that Mr. <i>Morton</i> is
waiting in the parlor.</p>

<p>After he is left alone, the man
looks about the comfortable appointments
of the room with a quick business
eye. He seems satisfied, but
has not much time for scrutiny, as he
hears a step coming down the stairs.
He rises, and stands ready to meet
Agnes as she enters. When her
eye falls on him, she stops at once,
and stands looking steadily at him
without speaking, but growing very
pale. He comes toward her, saying,
“Agnes!” and holding out both his
hands. She does not take them, nor
offer any welcome, but says, in a cold,
quiet voice, “What do you want
of me?”</p>

<p>“Are you, then, so unforgiving to
me, Agnes? After all my long
search for you, is this all the greeting
you can give me?”</p>

<p>“I do not know how long your
search may have been, but I am sorry
that you have succeeded in finding
me. What is it you want of
me?” she says, in the same cold tone.</p>

<p>“To live with you, as I would
have done all these years if you had
not so unaccountably hidden yourself
away.” He says this with an air
of boldness, and of assertion of some
right which he supposes she must
recognize.</p>

<p>She smiles disdainfully. She divines
the selfishness of this move,
and she sees that he is ignorant of
the extent of her knowledge concerning
him.</p>

<p>“Where have you been all these
years?” he asks, as she continues
silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not bound to account for
myself to you,” she replies.</p>

<p>“Come, now, Agnes, this is foolish.
Why not be friendly? It is
best for you to be so. I have seen
you with the boy. He is mine, and
I can claim him, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! you cannot do that.”</p>

<p>“You think I cannot? Pray, why?
You are my wife, and he is my son.”</p>

<p>“He is your son, but I am not
your wife,” she says, in a firm tone.</p>

<p>“Not my wife! But you were
married to me. Oh! shame, Agnes!
I did not expect that <i>you</i>, who insisted
on the tying of that knot, would
be the one to untie it. In what position
does it place you and the boy
if you are not my wife? I suppose
you have considered <i>that</i>, and you
must have advanced somewhat in
your ideas to be so independent now
of public opinion.”</p>

<p>Her face is very pale, and her lips
have been firmly set. There is a
cold, stern light in her eyes as she
answers: “I was never your wife.
You were not free to marry me, even
if I had been free to marry you.
You were never divorced from your
wife, so you can have no claim on
me.”</p>

<p>He looks astonished, and for a
moment cringes just a little as she
says this. But he rallies, and says,
“That will not matter now, my wife
is dead; do you know that?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You do? Why, how do <i>you</i> know
so much, when I only know that bare
fact? Pray, can you tell me anything
more?”</p>

<p>His tone is half satirical, half beseeching.
He really wishes to know
more than the meagre information
which he has gleaned from the neighbors
of the house where Margaret
died&mdash;that a Mrs. Vanderlyn was
buried from that house. The landlady
has gone they know not where.
They remember the funeral, that is
all. He is anxious to know what
has become of Margaret’s money.
He thinks the priests have it; but he
is not sure of this, however, for one
person has told him that a relative
who was nurse for the Catholic lady at
the last inherited all her money. It
has puzzled him very much to guess
who this person could have been. He
has not succeeded in finding any
record of Margaret’s will. F. Francis
and Mrs. Vanderlyn had thought it
wiser not to have it recorded, considering
Agnes’ peculiar relation to Vanderlyn,
who might yet return to dispute
the possession of the money
with her, or to trouble her. Now
that Agnes seems to know something
of his wife, it occurs to him that she
may possibly be that <i>relative</i> who
inherited the money. Knowing the
disposition of each of these women
as he does&mdash;the one for nursing the
sick, the other generous and forgiving&mdash;he
sees that, if they met at all,
this might have been the consequence.
Remarkable quickness of
deduction and conclusion he has
always possessed, and it serves him
now, and makes him more determined
in his designs upon Agnes; but he
is desirous of playing his game adroitly.
She, on her part, wishes to shorten
the interview, and be rid of him.</p>

<p>“I can tell you,” she says, “that
your wife died as she lived, a saintly
woman; that she was the kindest,
truest friend to me I ever had. I
knew from her the falsehood you told
me when you said you were divorced
from her, and the base deception
you practised on me in pretending to
make me your wife.”</p>

<p>“For love of you, Agnes! There
was no other way for me. Let my
love be my excuse.”</p>

<p>She disdains any notice of this
interruption, and continues:</p>

<p>“It was an infamous falsehood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and treachery to me; but let that
pass. I was almost equally to blame,
for I had no real right to marry
you.”</p>

<p>“How so? You, at least, were
free,” he says.</p>

<p>“No; my husband lived. I was
still John Thorndyke’s wife in the
eyes of the church.”</p>

<p>“Church!” he repeats scornfully.</p>

<p>“Martin Vanderlyn, I am a Catholic.
It may modify your tone
and remarks to be aware of that. I
am proud and thankful to be of Margaret’s
faith.”</p>

<p>He frowns, but thinks quickly that
he may turn this to his advantage.</p>

<p>“Why are you called Rodney,
then, and Thorndyke on your door,
if you are Mrs. Thorndyke still?”</p>

<p>“My son’s name is Rodney. He
has no other, and I will bear his. I
decline to account to you for the
name on my door.”</p>

<p>“You are very proud, Agnes, but
I think it is best for you to be friendly
with me, considering all things.
I certainly am free to marry you
now, and give the boy and you your
right name and place. I should
think you were the very woman to
wish that. I happen to know of
John Thorndyke’s death, too, so I
think you are as free as I am now,
even on your own ground. Agnes, I
never meant to leave you so long.
I wrote to you, and got no answer.
I have searched for you in every
direction, and only now I find you.
Why are you so unwilling to live as
my wife with me, when you see that
it would place you and your son in
a more respectable condition?”</p>

<p>Agnes remembers Margaret’s words:
“See to it that he marries you when
I am gone!” Then it had seemed
doubtful if he could be persuaded to
do so. And here he is suing for
her consent. She remembers his
son’s position, “nobody’s child,”
but she remembers also her first-born
son. She remembers the bold,
false, bad heart and life of Martin
Vanderlyn; she sees the possible
effect of his evil influence on both
her sons, as it formerly blighted her
own life, and she shrinks in horror
and disgust at the bare thought of
such a stepfather introduced into
their home. She answers his question
without hesitation:</p>

<p>“I do not love you. I cannot
respect you. You were false to your
wife and false to me. I have been
able to live happily without you all
these years, and I shall live apart
from you still.”</p>

<p>He keeps down his pride, and appears
yet to hope to change her resolution,
thinking it may be only the
result of a woman’s pique. Moreover,
he feels almost sure now that
the comfortable home around her is
purchased with the money left by
Margaret. At all events, he is determined
on getting a home if possible
at her expense, and he does not
scruple at any misrepresentation regarding
his own means of support.
To her last scornful words, he replies,
with an air of kind consideration:</p>

<p>“But, Agnes, you will not always
be able to support yourself as well
as I can support you. I know not
how you do it, but I can place you
above the need of any effort on your
part. Why can you not be frank
with me, and tell me how you have
managed to live? You did not receive
all the money I sent, for some
of it came back to me. Tell me,
Agnes.”</p>

<p>“Martin Vanderlyn, I will not accept
anything for either of us from
you. We can do without you, and
we <i>will</i>. My decision is final.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the harm I can do
you?” he says, in an angry voice, and
with flashing eyes. “I can brand
you to the world and to the boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
Would you rather that than have
a husband, and a father for your
son?”</p>

<p>She seems to shrivel and whiten
at his threat, but she stands firm, and
answers him:</p>

<p>“You committed bigamy when
you married me. What will the law
do about <i>that</i>? I can prove it,
sir! Now, had you not better leave
me?”</p>

<p>“No! I swear I will not leave
you until you promise to marry
me!”</p>

<p>At this moment, a man’s step is
heard in the hall. He has entered
the house, quietly opening the door
with a key of his own, and, while
taking off his overcoat, has heard the
last words of both the speakers. He
steps within the room, and comes to
Agnes’ side, passing his arm around
her trembling form. He is a powerful
young man, in full and vigorous
health, which contrasts strongly with
Vanderlyn’s sallow face and wasted
figure. He looks at Vanderlyn with
piercing eyes as he says:</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir, by
speaking to this lady in this manner?
Mother, has he any right here that
you acknowledge?”</p>

<p>“None, my son; I wish only to be
rid of him.”</p>

<p>“Then, go,” says Thorndyke, “or
I will see that you do. And if you
trouble her again, I will see that the
law lays its hand on you more heavily
than I will lay mine if you do not
leave us at once.”</p>

<p>Vanderlyn has gazed in great astonishment
at this unexpected champion
for Agnes. When he hears him
call her “mother,” it flashes upon
his quick perception why “Thorndyke”
is on the door. He does not
forget that there was a boy left in
Agnes’ old home, whom he once
promised to care for as if he were his
own. Not much more has he cared for
his own; but this is an opponent he
does not like. This is a different kind
of quarrel from the one he supposed he
had with a defenceless woman. His
game is lost; he knows it, but he
tries to be very brave in his defeat.
He says scornfully:</p>

<p>“Mr. Thorndyke, I do not ask
<i>your</i> hospitality. I remember the
quality of the article I had from your
father some years ago. Yours seems
to be of the same sort. I will not
disturb the <i>honorable</i> repose of your
family, or try to become further acquainted
with my son, <i>your brother</i>.”</p>

<p>George raises his clenched hand
to fell him to the floor, but Agnes
interposes, and Vanderlyn leaves the
house untouched&mdash;leaves it, but
reels as he goes down the steps&mdash;staggers&mdash;falls
upon the pavement
only a few paces from the door. A
few moments later, George Rodney,
coming in the house, cries:</p>

<p>“A man has fallen dead in the
street, just by the corner! I was
coming around the other side, and I
almost met him!”</p>

<p>George Thorndyke rushes out, and
sees the men carrying Martin Vanderlyn’s
senseless body away.</p>

<p>The next day, Agnes and her sons
read in the papers that the man died
of heart disease, which the doctors
thought had been aggravated by
some recent excitement. The mother
and son are thankful that
George’s hand did not fall upon him;
but George Rodney never knows
that the man he “almost met,” and
who dropped down before his eyes,
was his own father.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c422" name="c422">THE INDIANS OF YSLETA.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> rich and thriving Pueblo of
the Ysléta Indians is situated on the
western bank of the Rio Grande del
Norte, about nine miles below the
little town of Albuquerque in New
Mexico.</p>

<p>We strike southward from Albuquerque
along the east bank of the
river. Three miles below the town
we enter on flat and uninteresting
bottomland. The eye is not relieved
by a dwelling, not even by a
tree, for a distance of five miles.
We thus come to a rancho, deserted
when we last passed there, but which
still gave evidence of former comfort.
The owner had joined the Texan
Confederates, and quitted the territory.</p>

<p>Now we begin to cross the Sand
Hills&mdash;a not unexciting performance.
The road is a narrow and shifting
one, growing daily narrower and
of steeper slope, as the winds blow
the sand upon it and fill it up. The
wagon moves along slowly at an
angle of 45°. The road winds tortuously
along the face of the Sand
Hills for about two miles, sometimes
making short and abrupt turns.
It is from two to three hundred feet
above the river which washes the
base of the hills. I feel an unpleasant
tingling sensation at my elbows,
and a great and almost uncontrollable
desire to walk&mdash;“to lighten the
load,” of course. Once on the road,
there is no going back, and one is entirely
at the mercy of one’s mules.
You must let them go their own way.
If they should grow restive or become
frightened, a broken neck, a
general and irretrievable “smash
up,” an unpleasant and unrecorded
grave in the quicksands of the Rio
Grande, would be the result. A six-mule
wagon went off at one of
the sharp turns some years ago. Its
fate was discovered by persons who
travelled some hours behind it, and
who noticed the tracks. The wagon
and team had been engulfed, and
had entirely disappeared before they
arrived.</p>

<p>From the Sand Hills, we have a
beautiful view of the Pueblo of
Ysléta on the opposite side of the
river. The spectacle of the Indians
fording the river in certain spots, and
driving their <i>burros</i> up the steep sides
of the Sand Hill on which their Pueblo
is built, enhances the picturesqueness
of the scene.</p>

<p>We have passed the Sand Hills,
and now we cross the river to visit
the Pueblo. We have struck a little
above the ford, however; the water
is in the bed of our wagon. We
have to stand on the seats in order
to keep dry, and we perceive, not
without alarm, that the mules are
swimming. By striking down-stream
a little, however, the mules find bottom
again, and pull us out all safe
on the western bank.</p>

<p>A steep and narrow path leads up
to the summit of the Sand Hill on
which the Pueblo is perched. The
Pueblos always have built and still
build their dwellings on the hill-tops:
for defensive reasons in the
olden times, for security against
inundations in the present. The
houses are built of the customary
adobe. They are washed outside
with a whitish wash which resists the
action of the weather; the mode of
its preparation is said to be known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
only to the Pueblos. I have seen
nothing like it in any of the Mexican
towns. The houses are generally
two stories high, the lower story
projecting considerably beyond the
upper. The entrance is through the
roof, to which you climb by a ladder
placed against the outside. This
mode of entrance is also a relic of
defensive precaution in past times of
hostilities with other tribes of Indians
and with the Spanish invaders. The
internal arrangement of the houses is
the reverse of ours. The kitchen is
in the upper story, and the sitting or
sleeping room in the lower. You
descend into the latter from the
former by an opening in the floor so
small that not even the lightest
weight of the Fat Man’s Club could
hope to squeeze through. The Pueblos
have no monstrous developments
of adipose tissue; the opening
is large enough for them. The
lower room is thoroughly secured
even against ventilation. The only
window consists of one piece of
glass, without frame, imbedded in
the wall.</p>

<p>The earthen vessels for family use
are manufactured by the Pueblos
themselves, and are ornamented with
fantastic designs of most primitive
execution. Chief among these vessels
is the <i>tinaja</i>, globular in shape, with
an orifice at the top large enough to
permit taking out the liquid contents
with a small dipper. The <i>tinaja</i> is
porous, to permit evaporation
through its sides. In hot weather,
the <i>tinajas</i> are filled from the river
or spring before sunrise, carefully
covered, and set in the shade. With
these precautions, they keep the water
almost ice-cold. They are used in
all Mexican <i>ménages</i>, as well as in the
households of the Pueblos.</p>

<p>The costume of the Pueblo men
is not lacking in picturesqueness,
more particularly when distance lends
its proverbial effect. They wear a
short loose sack of white cotton, or
manta, ordinarily made of carefully
washed flour-sacks; for your Pueblo
Indian is economical, and, when he
has sustained the inward man with the
contents of the flour-sack, he covers
the outer man with the sack itself.
The pantaloons are of the same material,
loose but short, not usually
reaching below the knee. The enchantment
of distance dispelled, however,
traces of the former uses of the
material may be discovered in such
inscriptions on the shoulders or the
seat as the following: “Superfine
Family,” or “Choice Family Extra.”
The Pueblo wears his hair long, tied
behind in a cue, around which is
wound a piece of red cloth or ribbon,
according to the financial standing
of the wearer, or mayhap the greatness
or solemnity of the occasion. The
head gear is generally a broad-brimmed
straw hat. The foot covering
is a deer-skin moccasin.</p>

<p>The costume of the gentler sex is
eminently ungraceful. The women
wind long strips of buckskin tightly
around the leg, in successive layers,
resulting in an enormous bandage
from three to four inches thick reaching
from the ankle to above the knee.
The <i>chaussure</i> is a moccasin. The
effect produced by this arrangement
is that of a feminine <i>torso</i> set on two
huge bolsters. All symmetry of form
or grace of gait is destroyed. The
walk is a sort of shuffle. The upper
covering of the figure is a dark woollen
stuff, coarse in texture, and of
Pueblo woof. This reaches to the
knee, and is composed of two rectangular
pieces joined at the upper edges,
which form the shoulders, and leaving
a space for the passage of the head
and neck. The pieces hang down
before and behind, and are held together
at the waist by a belt or cincture.
The women cut their hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
squarely across the forehead, leaving
the side locks and back hair to hang
down loosely. Many of the men,
too, besides wearing a cue, cut the
hair straight across the forehead, and
wear the pendent side-locks. The
women wear their arms bare, save the
ornamentation of from one to a dozen
bracelets of thick wire, which glitters,
but is not gold. They wear necklaces
of coral, moss-agates, or common
glass beads, according to the wealth
or importance of the wearer. The
men also frequently wear similar
necklaces.</p>

<p>The portion of the feminine toilet
which requires most elaboration is
evidently the leg-bandage. It is
taken off to cross the ford on foot,
and its removal seems to be as slow
a process as unrolling a mummy.
The object of such a covering for the
nether limbs I am unable to imagine.</p>

<p>The Pueblo is a handsome Indian.
I have seen very finely cut features
among the men. Many of them
have beautifully fresh complexions,
on which a bright apple-rosy tint is
gradually shaded into a deep rich
brown. They are generally of medium
stature, however. Their feet
and hands are correspondingly small.
Their faces have not that animal,
that <i>wolfish</i>, expression of the wild
Indians of the mountains or the
plains; on the contrary, they beam
with good nature, simplicity, and
single-heartedness. They are thrifty
and industrious. The men do the
out-door work; the women attend
to the household affairs, or, in the
season, peddle the grapes, apricots,
peaches, melons, etc., raised in their
Pueblo. Should you meet a Pueblo
and his squaw travelling with the
universal <i>burro</i>, you will always find
the lady mounted on the animal,
while her cavalier, urging on John
Burro with his stick, trots along
gaily behind, and smilingly gives
you a cheery “<i>Come te va?</i>” as he
passes.</p>

<p>The Pueblos do not intermarry
with the Mexicans. The women are
chaste in their lives, and domestic in
their habits. Vice is almost unknown
among them. I have lived some
years in the vicinity of two or three
Indian Pueblos, and have neither
known of nor heard of an abandoned
woman among them. I wish I could
say the same of other races in the
territory. In this regard, the Pueblos
also differ greatly from the wild
Indians whose lives are continued
scenes of bestiality.</p>

<p>During my residence in their
vicinity, the Pueblos had daily access
to my dwelling. They were our
fruit and vegetable purveyors. I
have not known an instance of
their stealing a pin’s worth, though
they had ample opportunities to pilfer
had they been so inclined. In
this regard, their example might be
imitated with profit by people with
greater pretensions to civilization,
and in this also they differ widely
from the savage Indians who are, to
a man, thieves both by nature and
habit. In fine, the Pueblos are
among the most moral, peaceful,
simple, and honest citizens of New
Mexico.</p>

<p>The Pueblos are Catholics. Their
Catholicity, in its out-door festivals,
has just sufficient tinge of the antique
observances of the Montezumas to
throw a romantic glamour around
it. They have churches in all their
Pueblos. Some of these&mdash;Ysléta
among the number&mdash;have a priest
regularly stationed in them, and
many of the churches are served by
the priests of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction
in which they are situated.
The churches are adobe structures,
not always cruciform, with a belfry,
and adorned inside with grotesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
figures, the product of their
own primitive art.</p>

<p>The weapon of the Pueblos is
still the bow and arrow. A few
have old-fashioned muzzle-loading
rifles. The Pueblos do not lack the
combative instinct, and are more than
a match for the Apaches and Navajoes,
man to man. They have frequently
acted in conjunction with
our troops against these tribes;
but their co-operation is often rendered
valueless by their custom,
most strictly adhered to, of returning
to their village as soon as they
have taken a scalp, for the purpose
of having the customary scalp-dance.
I regret to say that they give no
quarter, and spare neither age nor
sex, except when it suits them to
make <i>peóns</i>, or slaves, of the women
and children. They say, in self-justification,
that little Indians soon
become big Indians if allowed to
grow. The measure they mete is
meted again to them by the hostile
tribes.</p>

<p>As in courtesy bound, we direct
our steps to the dwelling of the
“governor,” who is known as “Don
Ambrosio.” His house is of more
modern construction than the customary
Pueblo dwelling. We were
admitted through a <i>corral</i> and a
door&mdash;not in the roof, but in the
side of the house, after the fashion
of “the whites.” The room we
were received in was a long apartment
<i>à la Mexicaine</i>, with benches
around the walls. Some of the finest
Navajo blankets I ever saw were
displayed upon the benches. The
walls were hung around with French
colored lithographs of a religious
character.</p>

<p>Governor Ambrosio was a dapper
little Indian, with long snow-white
hair falling loosely to his shoulders.
His complexion was clear and peach-bloomy.
Though full of years and
honors, he was full of life and health.
His son, who acted as his lieutenant,
was a man about thirty-odd years,
the image of his father, in stature,
size, complexion, and everything except
the white hair, the junior’s being
jet-black. The women of the family
were pleasingly featured, but their
inartistic dress destroyed the effect of
their good looks.</p>

<p>Ambrosio is said to be quite
wealthy, with fifty or sixty thousand
dollars in <i>oro</i> and in <i>plata</i>; for
your Pueblo does not consider
greenbacks good hoarding. Ambrosio,
Jr., showed us the fruithouse,
where the senses of sight
and smell were regaled with the
pleasant spectacles and odors of heaps
of rich, fragrant quinces and apples,
the latter small but rosy as young
Ambrosio’s pleasant face.</p>

<p>Ambrosio’s style of farming is more
in accordance with modern progressive
ideas than that of some of his
neighbors. His mules were fat, round,
and sleek, and in the <i>corral</i> lay an
American plough of modern construction.
Many among the middle and
lower classes in New Mexico still
plough “with a sharp stick.” The irrigating
dikes, or <i>acequias</i>, of the Pueblos
are well and carefully attended
to; they are not permitted to overflow
in the wrong places and at the wrong
times&mdash;a neglect which so frequently
causes the traveller from the valley
of the Rio Grande to soar from prosaic
observation to the sublimity of
anathema. In their fields, I saw
men, only, engaged in agricultural
labors.</p>

<p>S. Augustine is the patron saint of
Ysléta. Its great <i>fiesta</i> is the “San
Augustin.” The feast is held about
the time when all the grapes are
gathered and some of the new wine
already made. It is essentially a
grape and wine feast. But to his
other virtues, the Pueblo adds the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
great one of temperance. Mass is
celebrated in the morning, and the
whole Pueblo is out in its showiest
attire. The dance known as “the
Montezuma” is performed by young
men selected for the occasion. Americans
and Mexicans are kindly received
and hospitably entreated in the
Pueblo on these festival occasions.
I have heard of but one instance in
which this kindness and hospitality
was abused. It was by a miserable
gambler&mdash;a “white man,” and, I regret
to say, an American&mdash;who, at
the San Augustin of 186-, without
the slightest provocation, shot dead
a Pueblo boy. The territory got rid

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c427a" name="c427a">Elements of Philosophy</a>, comprising
Logic and Ontology, or General
Metaphysics.</span> By Rev. W. H. Hill,
S.J., Professor of Philosophy in the
St. Louis University. Baltimore:
J. Murphy &amp; Co. London: R. Washburne.</p>

<p class="p1">We are glad to see this anxiously expected
volume. The author proves himself
quite competent to the most important
task he has undertaken, and writes
with the ease and precision of a thorough
student and practised teacher of the
highest and most necessary but most
neglected and abused of all the rational
sciences, philosophy. In his doctrine, he
follows S. Thomas and Suarez, and is
therefore necessarily sound in his principles
and method. The most subtile, abstruse,
and controverted points in respect
to which there is the most difference
among the votaries of scholastic
philosophy, and those topics also where
there is the best opportunity for the author
to display special ability in his explication
of doctrines in which all scholastic
philosophers are substantially
agreed, are found in the special metaphysics.
The present volume, proceeding
no further than general metaphysics,
does not enable us to judge of the way in
which the author will treat these questions.
So far as he goes, we are satisfied
with his explication of the grand
fundamental principles and truths of
philosophy, and wait with favorable anticipations
his second volume. The style
is admirably precise and clear, and as
neat and elegant as our imperfect language
will admit in such a treatise. An
able correspondent, whose letter will appear
in our next number, has laid down
certain rules in regard to this point, and
made some pertinent observations in
which we concur, and we refer our readers
to that forthcoming letter. We think
he will find that F. Hill has generally
adopted the style which he recommends.
We find, so far as we have had time to
examine, only one word which appears
to us open to criticism, “cognoscive,”
used in place of the term cognoscitive,
employed by Cudworth and found in
Webster’s <i>Dictionary</i>. The term <i>Idea</i>
also seems to us to need a more full and
precise explanation, in connection with
the terms <i>species sensibilis</i>, <i>species intelligibilis</i>,
<i>species impressa</i> and <i>expressa</i>, and <i>verbum
mentis</i>, as used by S. Thomas, which
we presume we may expect to be given in
the treatise on psychology. A teacher
who has been thoroughly taught philosophy
will find this treatise, we think, well
suited to the purposes of a text-book.
The question, how far teachers who read
only English, and are obliged to learn
themselves a sound system before they
can teach it to others, or intelligent pupils
in their own private studies, will
find the exposition of philosophy in this
volume intelligible and satisfactory, can
better be answered after a fair trial. The
logic has been much shortened and simplified,
yet includes, we think, all that is
essential for training the class of pupils
who will use the book in the rules of
correct reasoning. If something more is
needed for exercise in syllogisms, any of
the books of logical praxis in common use
will answer the purpose. We recommend
the adoption of F. Hill’s philosophy
as a text-book to all teachers in
Catholic schools, both male and female,
where English text-books are used. It
is the only English text-book fit for use
in teaching philosophy. Our impression
is&mdash;that it will be found on trial to be an
excellent text-book for the higher classes
of pupils, and we thank the author for the
great service he has rendered in preparing
it, hoping that he will not delay to
finish his work.</p>

(Fifth volume of F. Coleridge’s Quarterly

<p class="p1">This is an historical novel after the
fashion of <i>Fabiola</i> and <i>Callista</i>. The
scene is laid in the time of Chlovis, about
the period of his marriage to Chlotildis.
The author has brought extensive and
accurate learning into play in this story,
which is thus a picture of the times it
describes. It is also a well-written and
interesting romance. We think he has
made Chlotildis, who is exquisite as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
ideal character, somewhat too perfect for
the strict historical truth. Although a
saint, she had a little of the barbarian left
in her, before she achieved the full
measure of the perfection of Christian
meekness, gentleness, and charity. All
readers will be pleased with the perusal
of this book. Our young friends in college
and convent, who are always keen
for a new book for wet days, of which we
have had so many of late, will be delighted
with this one, and, while they are
reading it, will forget the disappointment
they are apt to feel when their favorite
prayer, <i>Donnez nous un beau jour</i>, is not

was Buried Alive. By Mgr. Gaume,
Prothonotary Apostolic. Translated,
and with a Preface, by Lady Herbert.
London: Burns, Oates &amp; Co. (New
York: Sold by The Catholic Publication
Society.)</p>

<p class="p1">The recent mission of Sir Bartle Frere,
by the British Government, to the Sultan
of Zanzibar, with a view to the suppression
of the slave-trade in East Africa, has
attracted American notice. Now, although
government intervention will be able to
put a stop to the shipping of slaves
across the seas, it cannot interfere with
slave-labor in Zanzibar itself and the adjoining
towns, or prevent the atrocities
of Portuguese and Arab agents who act
as traders on their own account. Catholic
charity, then, has found a way of reaching
where government influence has no
bearing. There is a community in Brittany
which devotes itself exclusively to
the education of little negresses, purchased
from the slavers in the African
marts. And, jointly with this community,
the Fathers of the Congregation of
the Holy Ghost and of the Sacred Heart
of Mary, who have founded a mission in
Zanzibar, buy up as many slave children
as they can, and educate them in the Catholic
faith. These devoted religious
would, of course, be able to do much
more in this way had they the pecuniary
means at their command. The
thrilling story of Suema is put forth in
order to excite an ardent zeal in the
hearts of Catholic readers for the purchase
of slave-children in East Africa,
whereby the curse that has befallen them
is turned into a blessing. The story is
perfectly authentic, the substance of it
having been taken down from Suéma’s
own lips, translated into French, and sent
home by the superior of the Zanzibar mission.</p>

<p>We are very sure the narrative itself,
as also the admirable preface and introduction
which accompany it, cannot fail
to awaken the sympathy of our Catholic
readers. When, then, they learn that the
sum of fifty francs, or about ten dollars
in currency, will purchase a boy or girl of
seven or eight in the slave-marts, they
will not be slow, we believe, to contribute
towards so glorious a work. And the
price of a single slave-child “will be received
with the greatest gratitude by the
R. P. Procurator-General of the Congregation
of the Holy Ghost and of the Sacred
Heart of Mary (who have charge of
the Zanzibar Mission), 30 Rue Thomond,
Paris, or by Monseigneur Gaume, 16 Rue

By the Rev. Henry Formby. New York:
The Catholic Publication Society. 1873.</p>

<p>This is a neat little book in catechism
form containing about 60 pages of the
most necessary and useful instruction on
the fifteen mysteries of the Holy Rosary.
F. Formby is doing a great work. He is
the right man just at the right time, and
seems to anticipate the wants of priest
and people. His other books are admirably
well calculated to interest not only
the youth for whom they were especially
intended, but also those of riper years.
The little book before us ought to be in
the hands of every Catholic, young and
old. It is also well calculated to instruct
those who think that our devotion to the
Blessed Virgin excludes God and the
Saviour from our prayers. All we have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
say is let any such person read this
catechism, and they will be forced to admit
that the Rosary is nothing more or
less than an epitome of the New Testament
history of our Lord, and that he is
mentioned on nearly every one of the
pages of this beautiful little book, for the
appearance of which we thank the Rev.
author most heartily.</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c429" name="c429">The Sign of the Cross in the Nineteenth
Century.</a></span> By Mgr. Gaume,
Prothonotary Apostolic. Translated
from the last French edition by A
Daughter of S. Joseph. Philadelphia:
Peter F. Cunningham. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This work, which might, to a passing
glance, appear fanciful and unimportant,
is truly philosophical and of rare interest.
It comes to us not only with the Imprimatur
of the Bishop of Philadelphia,
but also with a Brief of His Holiness
Pius IX., granting an indulgence of fifty
days to the sign of the cross, in response
to the illustrious author’s petition.</p>

<p>The author is able to say, in his preface
to the second edition, that the book has
had a wonderful success: “The first
French edition was sold in a few months.
Three translations of it have been made
into different European languages&mdash;one
in Rome, one in Turin, and one in Germany.
Catholic papers have vied with
one another in recommending its perusal,
and many letters have been sent to
us bearing the congratulations of the
most respectable men of France and of
foreign countries.” He then, after quoting
the Neapolitan review, <i>Scienza e Fede</i>,
appends a portion of a letter from the
Dean of the Catholic Chair at Rome, and
also a circular from the commission
charged with the care of the regionary
schools, to the effect that the book should
be read by the pupils, and distributed as
a premium.</p>

<p>The preface to the first edition explains
the origin of the treatise&mdash;how a
young German of distinction, having
come to study at the College of France,
found his companions there laugh at
him for making the sign of the cross before
and after meals, and so by requesting
the author’s opinion of the practice, and
of the sign in general, occasioned the
twenty letters which form the volume.</p>

<p>These letters exhaust the subject in a
masterly way truly French. Besides
proving over again what has been proved
so many times before, the antiquity of
the holy sign among Christians, and
how the noblest intellects of primitive
times both taught and practised the use
of it, Mgr. Gaume shows that it was made
in some way before Christianity, and
from the beginning of the world. “The
sign of the cross is so natural to man
that at no epoch, among no nation, and
in no form of worship, did man ever put
himself in communication with God by
prayer without making the sign of the
cross.” Then he gives the “seven ways
of making it”:</p>

<p>“(1) With the arms extended: man then
becomes an entire sign of the cross. (2)
With hands clasped, the fingers interlaced:
thus forming five signs of the
cross. (3) The hands joined one against
the other, the thumbs placed one over the
other: again the sign of the cross. (4)
The hands crossed on the breast: another
form of the sign of the cross. (5) The
arms equally crossed on the breast: fifth
way of making it. (6) The thumb of the
right hand passing under the index
finger, and resting on the middle one: a
sign of the cross much in use, as we shall
see. (7) And, finally, the right hand
passing from the forehead to the breast,
and from the breast to the shoulders:
a more explicit form, which you know.”</p>

<p>“Under one or other of these forms,”
he adds, “the sign of the cross has been
practised everywhere and always in
solemn circumstances, with a knowledge
more or less clear of its efficacy.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, he proceeds to show,
first, how the Jews made it, instancing
Jacob, Moses, Samson, David, Solomon,
and others. And here he only echoes
what the Fathers have observed before
him. Next, he tells us how the pagans
made it, attaching to it some mysterious
value. Three of the ways of making it
were known to them; and these ways,
being universal, were not arbitrary.</p>

<p>Some curious facts of undoubted authenticity
are related of the power of the
holy sign when made even by strangers
to Christianity. And this sets off its
efficacy as it is made in the church.
Now, our author laments, and, we fear,
with good reason, that the sign of the
cross is fast becoming obsolete among a
large number of Catholics. Those who
make it at all, too often make it very imperfectly
and carelessly. The object, therefore,
of the present work is to revive the
ancient practice of making the sign frequently
and making it thoroughly. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
it is with the same intention that the Pope
has granted fifty days’ indulgence to it
when made reverently and with invocation
of the august Trinity.</p>

From the French. With thirty-two Illustrations.
Westchester: Printed at the
Catholic Protectory. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This book exhibits Christianity in action.
Plato said, “If virtue could be seen
embodied”&mdash;he meant in living form&mdash;“all
men would love and adore it.”
Plato’s dream was realized when Love became
incarnate, and walked about doing
good to the bodies and souls of men; but
all men did not adore it. Virtue, to be
adored, must be known. The book before
us makes known the cardinal virtue
of Christianity, charity, by exhibiting her
in human form, and telling us, not what
she can do or should do, but what she <i>did</i>
do by the hands of the Christian Brothers
during the late memorable war between
France and Prussia. Of the success of
this glorious order in doing the work for
which it was started by its venerable founder,
it is not our purpose to speak, but
of the book which lies before us, and which
tells so graphically the deeds of charity
and heroism of these Brothers during the
terrible war of 1870-71. It is translated
from the French of J. D’Arsac.</p>

<p>The mechanical execution of the volume

<p class="p1">This is a book written by a lady, and
it bears in every chapter and page the

and the characters are so natural that we
feel in reading it that we are only renewing
our acquaintance with old friends.
The scene is laid in this country, and the
actors are Americans, some by birth,
others by adoption, and in this respect it
has the advantage over most of the works
of fiction which have issued from the
press of late, which, while treating us, or
pretending to treat us, to a view of the
inside lives of Europeans, utterly ignore
the fact that at our very door there are
abundant materials for a hundred novels

New York: G. Routledge &amp; Sons.
1873.</p>

<p class="p1">The life which this book relates was
sufficiently quiet, so far as its immediate
subject was concerned, to suggest to
other than personal friends the sense of
tame and insipid, were it not for its association
with characters more or less
historical. And this reminds us of the
difference between Catholic and Protestant
biography: whereas the latter is restricted
in its range to one country or
language, the former embraces within
the scope of its interest all nations and
races. The record of the obscurest
priest, if true to his vocation, may excite
sympathy in those widely separated from
him in time and space: for his spiritual
life is quickened by the same blood
which courses through kindred veins in
the highest social walks, and among the
rudest tribes of distant islands; the
works of mercy and charity in which he
is engaged also occupy the thoughts and
energies of his brethren in every part of
the globe; and the same seal which attests
his ministry may be recognized in
theirs also.</p>

<p>The subject of this volume, the widow
of Augustus W. Hare, was the daughter
of a clergyman, and in her maiden years
was an intimate friend of Bishop Heber,
then rector of Hodnet, England. Her
husband, himself a clergyman, was joint
author with his brother Julius W., also a
clergyman, of <i>Guesses at Truth</i>. The family
trace their descent from Francis
Hare, one of the bishops of George II.’s
reign, and boast of other prelatical and
noble connections with the church “as
by law established.”</p>

<p>It might naturally be inferred, therefore,
that the author, a nephew of the
subject, would be thoroughly penetrated
with Anglican “principles,” and find all
his ideals in the communion to which we
are inclined to attribute the discovery
of the “happy medium” between truth
and error. But, alas for the perversity
of human nature! he cannot see the
schemes of Victor Emmanuel through a
rose-colored lens. He has the temerity
to express sympathy for the august prisoner
of the Vatican; his regret for the
dismemberment and spoliation of convents
and monasteries&mdash;the dispersion
of their libraries, the interruption of the
charitable works in which they were engaged,
and the appropriation by the government
of the dowers which these religious
brought with them to their respective
houses; the wiping out of many
beautiful religious associations, along
with the destruction of the monuments
with which they were connected. He
even has the hardihood to doubt whether
there is a moral gain in the freedom now
vouchsafed to the vendors of Protestant
Bibles and the flood of <i>popular</i> literature,
which has signalized the advent of the
Sardinian usurper, as we glean from an
article by the author in a recent number
of <i>Good Words</i>.</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c431c" name="c431c">The Poodle Prince.</a></span> By Edouard Laboulaye,
Member of the Institute. Translated
by W. H. Bishop. Milwaukee:
Office of the <i>Journal of Commerce</i>.
Pamphlet.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a most clever <i>brochure</i>, full of
wit and humor, which is, however, only
the sparkle of serious thought, for the
object of the author is a serious one.
M. Laboulaye is a Protestant and a Liberal,
but he is, we believe, one of the
most respectable and moderate writers
of that school, and is certainly one of
those who are disposed to be respectful
toward the Catholic Church. Writers of
this class, though they are deficient in respect
to their positive political doctrines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
are yet often the most effective and
powerful opponents of that Cæsarism
which Catholics have so much reason to
detest and oppose. The present <i>brochure</i>,
which we regret not to have the pleasure
of reading in its original French, is a
satire on Napoleonic Cæsarism, together
with a brilliant fancy sketch of what the
author dreams of as a happy political
condition for France. The Poodle
Prince is king of the Fly-catchers, and
receives his funny appellation from the
circumstance that his godmother, a fairy,
occasionally turns him into a poodle.
She does this whenever he is about to
be befooled by his ministers, or to make a
fool of himself. In his character as poodle,
he meets with mishaps and acquires
a knowledge of the actual state of things
among his subjects, which are very serviceable
to him, and he finishes by becoming
a model of what a wise and patriotic
prince ought to be, and doing
what such a prince ought to do, according
to the idea of M. Laboulaye. This
idea is simply that the institutions of the
Republic of the United States are those
which France ought to copy, with, as we
suppose the author intends, a nominal
monarch and a responsible ministry, in
place of an elective chief-magistrate.</p>

<p>We agree with him in respect to the
end which he wishes to attain, viz., the
just liberty and prosperity of the mass of
the people, by means of a government
which is properly restrained by laws and
other efficacious checks from tyrannizing
over the nation. We do not believe,
however, in transplanting our institutions
to French soil. They are the best and
the only ones for ourselves, because they
have grown here naturally. But we are
convinced that France can only prosper
under a monarchy, and that a real one in
which the king rules as well as reigns.
This does not hinder the formation of a
constitution and a mixed government in
which the people have a share as voting
citizens, and by which the monarchical
power is limited, though not destroyed.
The Napoleon Dynasty is the creation of
the Revolution, and therefore will not do.
The Orléans family has compromised
with the Revolution, and therefore will
not do, unless it will renounce the maxims
of 1789, and return to its proper place
under the headship of the Count de
Chambord. The latter, in his avowed
principles, gives the best guarantee France
can have for liberty as well as order.
The restoration of her ancient monarchy,
with Henry V. for king, and the <i>fleur de
lis</i> for her symbol, with the church re-instated
in her complete rights and privileges,
and with the modifications of political
and social relations suited to the
present time, is, in our view, the only
way of realizing that which F. Ramière,
in his able paper published in our present
number, points out as the way of salvation
for <i>la belle France</i> “<i>Le Drapeau blanc
c’est un beau drapeau</i>,” and we hope to see
it supplant the tricolor, and wave in triumph
over regenerated France.</p>

<p>To return to M. Laboulaye. His exquisite
satire has been well rendered into
good English by his translator. Whoever
reads it, and is able to appreciate the
finest intellectual sword-play, will enjoy
a rich and rare pleasure. Moreover,
there is so much truth, and good sense,
and genuine philanthropic sentiment contained
under the envelope of fancy and
satire, that we can sincerely and conscientiously
commend its general scope and
spirit, and pronounce it a work as well
worth reading for a serious purpose, as
it is for amusement.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Ye fathers! let your children learn grammar, and keep able men as teachers who are accomplished,
and not players, pay them well, and see that the schools are no holes and corners. All
should practise grammar in some degree, for it wakens the mind, and helps much. But the poets
should not thereby destroy everything else. There should be a law made that no bad poet should
be read in the schools, such as Ovid, <i>De Arte Amandi</i>, Tibullus and Catullus, of the same sort,
Terentius in many places. Virgil and Cicero I would suffer, Homer in the Greek, and also some
passages from S. Augustine’s work, <i>De Civitate Dei</i>, or from S. Jerome, or something out of the
Holy Scriptures. And where your teachers find in these books Jupiter, Pluto, and the like named,
say then, Children, these are fables, and show them that God alone rules the world. So would the
children be brought up in wisdom and in truth, and God would be with them.”&mdash;<i>Sermon of Savonarola.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was but natural that the striking
events of the life of Savonarola, and
the tragic scenes of the close of his career,
should have absorbed the attention
of his early biographers to the
exclusion of the less attractive and
more difficult duty of appreciating
and presenting the moral and intellectual
side of his character. He is
constantly described by those friendly
to his memory as a grand pulpit
orator and Heaven-inspired reformer;
by others, as the sensational
preacher and extravagant innovator;
while little or nothing is said by either
of his literary and philosophical acquirements.
By turns, and according
to their several views, they exhibit
him to us as fanatic and impostor,
as prophet and martyr, while
the figure of the scholar, the philosopher,
and the theologian remains
invisible. It is, nevertheless, but fair
to say that this arises partially from
the fact that a very important portion
of Savonarola’s literary productions
was unknown to his contemporaries
and their immediate successors. Modern
research has brought to light a
large number of which they never
heard. Another circumstance has
contributed to confirm the mistaken
impression concerning him as a man
wanting in literary capacity, namely,
the effort to make of him the enemy
of literature by classing him among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the opponents of the so-called revival
of letters in Europe.</p>

<p>What is styled the revival of letters
in the XVth century really began
in Italy long before, and was prepared,
says Hallam, by several circumstances
that lie further back in Italian
history. The classic revelation of
the XVth century was indeed a
revelation to Germany, France, and
England, but not to Italy. The true
restorer of classical antiquity in Italy,
and consequently in Europe, had
already appeared in the XIVth century,
and his name was Petrarch
(1304-1374). It was he who first
inspired his countrymen with his
own admiration of the classic beauties
of Virgil and Cicero. The larger
portion of his works is written in
Latin, and he died under the delusion
that his <i>Africa</i>, a Latin poem, was
his greatest work. A taste for the
cultivation of the Roman classics
grew steadily from this period, gaining
strength and ardor every day,
until it became the absorbing passion
of all ranks of scholars. Even
Poggio Bracciolini, usually assigned
exclusively to the XVth, belongs
partially to the XIVth century. So
also does Guarino Guarini, the greatest
of the early Hellenists.</p>

<p class="pc1">PAGANISM IN LITERATURE.</p>

<p class="p1">The tide of classical enthusiasm
was now swollen by the introduction
of the Greek classics and the emigration
to Italy of numerous distinguished
Greek scholars. Historians
vie with each other in describing
the enthusiastic ardor of the Italians
in the cultivation of these two great
ancient literatures. It amounted to
an intoxication that seized upon
young and old, laity and clergy,
women as well as men. The purely
literary advantages to be obtained by
so general a devotion to classic lore
were of course enormous. But in
this world, says a distinguished English
Catholic divine<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> in referring to
the period in question, “evil follows
good as its shadow, human nature
perverting and corrupting what is intrinsically
innocent or praiseworthy.
It was not Virgil, nor Cicero, nor
Tacitus, nor Homer, nor Demosthenes
that was most read and
imitated, but Propertius, and Tibullus,
and Apuleius. Pagan ideas colored
men’s thoughts; pagan ethics
supplanted Christian morals; pagan
theogony was better understood than
the Christian catechism; and their
influences spread not only through
the schools, but to the cloister. Men
sought in those classics, not poetry,
but pruriency; not finished style, but
abandoned vice; not accountability
in a hereafter, but nothingness in the
future. The Fathers, many of whom
wrote for the express purpose of denouncing
the heathen immorality of
these productions, must not be studied,
because, forsooth, of the uncouthness
of their style. Paganism impressed
itself on everything, and men sought
to ignore the road to Calvary that
they might enter the flowery path of
Olympus.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the period was
most propitious for the introduction
and spread of this moral poison.
For long years, Italy had been demoralized
by violent factions and
bloody wars. Society was disorganized.
The removal of the head of
the church to Avignon had been
fatal to ecclesiastical discipline. The
effects of this laxity produced that
most frightful of scourges&mdash;a corrupt
clergy; and although scores of volumes
have been written describing
with great minuteness all the details
of the rapid march and wide extent
of this fatal influence, it would be
difficult to present in any shorter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
space at this day any adequate idea
of its depth or intensity. Alone and
unaided, Savonarola dared to attack
paganism in literature in its stronghold;
for Florence was at that time
the centre of the Hellenic and Roman
revival, and filled with its most
passionate devotees. He thus arrayed
himself against Italy and the
spirit of the age. He denounced
pagan literature, and scouted as
absurd the fanaticism for its study.
Not the laity alone, but the clergy
and the hierarchy, came in for a share
of his strictures. “In the houses of
the great prelates and great doctors,”
he cries out, “nothing is thought of
but poetry and rhetoric. Go and
see for yourselves: you will find
them with books of polite literature
in their hands&mdash;pernicious writings&mdash;with
Virgil, Horace, and Cicero, to
prepare themselves for the cure of
souls withal. Astrologers have the
governance of the church. There is
not a prelate, there is not a great
doctor, but is intimate with some
astrologer who predicts for him the
hour and the moment for riding out
or for whatever else he does. Our
preachers have already given up
Holy Scripture, and are given to
philosophy, which they preach from
the pulpit, and make it their queen.
As to Holy Scripture, they treat it
as the handmaid, because to preach
philosophy looks learned, whereas it
should simply be an aid in the interpretation
of the divine Word.”</p>

<p>In another sermon, he says:
“They tickle the ears with Aristotle,
Plato, Virgil, and Petrarch, and take
no concern in the salvation of souls.
Why do they not, instead of books
like these, teach that alone in which
are the law and the spirit of life? The
Gospel, my Christian brethren, must
be your constant companion. I
speak not of the book, but its spirit.
If ye have not the spirit of grace,
although you carry the whole volume
about with you, it will be of no avail.
And how much more foolish are
those who go about loaded with
briefs and tracts, and look as if they
kept a stall at a fair? Charity does
not consist of sheets of paper. The
true books of Christ are the apostles
and saints: the true reading of them
is to imitate their lives.”</p>

<p>Because Savonarola thus denounced
ancient classic literature, it must not
be supposed that he was either ignorant
of it or unable to recognize
what was really valuable in it. On
the contrary, he was as familiar with
Greece and Rome as his adversaries,
and denounced only such pagan
authors as were dangerous to morality.
He might as consistently
have been charged with ignorance
of Aristotle, the whole of whose philosophy
and writings he had, as it
were, at his fingers’ ends, because,
after denouncing from the pulpit the
blindness with which that philosopher
was followed, he would ask:
“Has your Aristotle succeeded in
proving the immortality of the
soul?”</p>

<p>Savonarola’s denunciation of the
evil effects of pagan literature is
too often represented as sweeping
and indiscriminate, while in point
of fact he falls short in both these
respects of a writer of the XIXth
century who counts a certain number
of respectable adherents. We refer
to the Abbé Gaume, who, in a remarkable
work published in France
in 18&mdash;, <i>Le Ver Rongeur des Sociétés
Modernes</i>, maintains that very many
of the evils of society that have their
origin in the education of youth may
be traced to the pagan ideas imbibed
in the early study of the Greek
and Roman classics.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Savonarola’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
position on this subject, in fact, appears
to have been substantially the
same with that of Tertullian, S. Basil,
and S. Jerome.</p>

<p>Partial justice has been done to
Savonarola as a powerful logician
and a learned theologian. His intimate
knowledge of the Scriptures
was something exceptional&mdash;not a
mere rote knowledge, for it is said
he knew them by heart, but a searching
and thorough familiarity which
showed a wonderful intellectual and
spiritual grasp of their body and spirit.</p>

<p class="pc1">HIS PHILOSOPHY.</p>

<p class="p1">As a philosopher, he has been credited
by all writers with a familiarity
with the systems of Plato and Aristotle,
then dominant; but his latest
Italian biographer, Villari, shows
satisfactorily that, in his theological
writings, he reasons with so much
freedom and independence that he
had practically freed himself from
the dominion of Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> His early
biographers made neither attempt
nor pretence to do more than relate
the material facts of his career.
Later writers, with more attention to
his published works, saw more
clearly his intellectual power, although
his philosophical productions
were almost entirely neglected.
M. Perrens does indeed direct attention
to them, but merely as “<i>des
catéchismes sans prétention</i>.” Rudelbach<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
is so engrossed with his sharp
search for Protestant ideas that he
takes no notice of his philosophical
writings. Meier<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> perceives that in
philosophy “he shows a judgment
and critical power of his own”;
while Poli, in his additions to Tennemann,
remarks his order and clearness.
“Not to acknowledge Savonarola
as a powerful logician,” says
Rio, in his remarkable work on
Christian art, “an accomplished orator,
a profound theologian, a genius
comprehensive and bold, a universal
philosopher, or rather, the competent
judge of all philosophy, would
be an injustice which history and his
contemporaries would not tolerate.”
The same author goes on to give him
credit for the possession of faculties
rarely found united with those which
make the logician and the theologian.
He says: “One might imagine
without doubt that it would be more
just to deny him the possession of
that rare gift of an exquisitely acute
and intuitive perception of the beautiful
in the arts of imagination, which
is not always the privilege of the
greatest genius, and which supposes
a sensibility of soul and a delicacy
of organs too difficult to meet with,
either the one or the other, in a monastic
person devoted to the mortifications
of the cloister; and yet it is
no exaggeration to say that both are
found united in a very high degree
in Savonarola.” The historian Guicciardini,
who had made special
study of Savonarola’s works, says:
“In philosophy, he was the most
powerful man in Italy, and reasoned
on it in so masterly a manner that it
seemed as if he had himself created
it.”</p>

<p>Although the mass of published
works of Savonarola may be truly
called enormous, very many of his
productions never appeared, most of
his manuscripts having been destroyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
or, in a few instances, but lately
brought to light. Among these latter,
Villari mentions a compendium
of all the works of Plato and Aristotle,
regularly catalogued as in the
library of S. Mark. Some of his
smaller treatises also survive, and
the same author recognizes the writer’s
originality and the bold hand
(<i>la mano ardita</i>) of Savonarola in such
passages as these:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We must, in all cases, proceed from
the known to the unknown; for thus
only can we arrive at truth with any degree
of facility. Sensations are nearest
and best known to us; they are gathered
up in the memory, where the mind transforms
individual sensations into one
general rule or experience; nor does it
stop here, but it proceeds further, and
from many united experiences arrives at
universal truths. Therefore, true experience
resolves itself into first principles&mdash;primary
causations; it is speculative,
free, and of the highest nature.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Savonarola’s definition of <i>veracity</i>,
strikingly acute and clear, is one not
likely to have been made by a man
at all weak either in philosophy or
moral principle. It is well worth
attention: “By veracity we understand
a certain habit by which a man,
both in his actions and in his words,
shows himself to be that which he
really is, neither more nor less.”
This, though not a legal, is a moral,
duty, for it is a debt which every
man in honesty owes to his neighbor,
<i>and the manifestation of truth is
an essential part of justice</i>. Savonarola
was, in fact, the first to shake off
the yoke of ancient authority in
philosophy. He alone, if we except
Lorenzo Valla, who spoke more
as a grammarian than a philosopher,
dared to declare against it.
“Some,” he says, “are so bigoted,
and have so entirely submitted their
understandings to the fetters of the
ancients, that not only dare they not
say anything in opposition to them,
but abstain from saying anything
not already said by them. What
kind of reasoning is this? What
additional strength of argument?
The ancients did not reason thus;
why, then, should we? If the ancients
failed to perform a praiseworthy
action, why should we also
fail?” And this sentiment he constantly
presents in various forms;
not in theory alone, moreover, but
in practice; not only in the special
discussion of philosophy, but in its
practical application. His <i>Triumph
of the Cross</i><a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> which is generally accepted
as his greatest work, is an
exposition of the whole Christian
doctrine by reason alone. He thus
states it in his preface: “As it is our
purpose to discuss the subject of this
book solely by the light of reason,
we shall not pay regard to any authority,
but will proceed as if there
had not existed in the whole world
any man, however wise, on whom to
rest our belief, taking natural reason
as our sole guide.” And he adds:
“To comprehend things that are
visible, it is not necessary to seek the
acquaintance of things invisible, for
all our knowledge of the extrinsic
attributes of corporeal objects is derived
from the senses; but our intellect,
by its subtlety, penetrates the
substance of natural things, by the consideration
of which we finally arrive
at a knowledge of things invisible.”</p>

<p>We have spoken of the large number
of Savonarola’s published works.
There would not be space in an article
like this even for a list of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
popular treatises on practical religious
duties, of which four were published
in one year alone (1492).
These were <i>On Humility</i>, <i>On Prayer</i>,
<i>On the Love of Christ</i>, and <i>On a Widow’s
Life</i>. With all their pious
fervor, they are marked by strong
practical judgment, and it is but little
wonder that the people of Florence
should have been enthusiastic in their
admiration of a priest who, in all the
various lines of his duty as teacher,
as confessor, and as preacher, was
always equal to his high calling.
His harshest critics have said of
him that, so violent was the asceticism
he taught and preached, he
opposed matrimony, and would have
turned Florence into a convent.
They are more than answered by the
following passage from <i>A Widow’s
Life</i>&mdash;<i>Libro della Vita Viduale</i>:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Widows are like children&mdash;under the
special protection of the Lord. The true
life for them to lead is to give up all
worldly thoughts, and devote themselves
to the service of God; to become like the
turtle-dove, which is a chaste creature;
and thus, when it has lost its companion,
no longer takes up with another, but
spends the rest of its life in solitude and
lamentation. Nevertheless, if for the education
of her children, or through poverty,
or for other good and sufficient motive,
the widow desire to marry again, let her
do so by all means. This would be preferable
to being surrounded by admirers,
and so expose herself to the risk of calumnies
and to a thousand dangers. Let
the widow who is not inclined to maintain
the strict decorum, the somewhat
difficult reserve, becoming her position,
rather return to the dignified life of a
married woman; but let those who feel
that they possess strength and temper of
mind equal to the demands of their state
become a model to other women. A
widow ought to dress in sober attire, to
live retired, to avoid the society of men,
to be gravity itself, and to maintain such
severity of demeanor that none may dare
utter by word or show by a smile the
least want of respect. By such a life, she
will be a continual lesson to other women,
and will render it unnecessary for a
widow to use words of counsel by which
to acquire influence over others. It is
unbecoming a widow to be prying into
the lives and failings of other persons;
it is unbecoming for her to be or even
appear to be vain, nor ought she, for the
sake of others, to forget what is due to
herself.”</p>

<p class="pc1">SCHOLAR AND POET.</p>

<p class="p1">Mention has already been made
of Savonarola’s devotion to the task
of teaching the novices of the order,
not only by his famous “damask rose-bush”
lectures which all learned
Florence crowded to hear, but his
classes of the humanities and physical
sciences. Not content with this,
and desiring that the monks of his
convent should live by the fruit of
their own labors, he established
schools in which they might learn
painting, sculpture, architecture, and
the art of copying and illuminating
manuscripts. He also opened a
department of oriental languages,
where Greek, Hebrew, Turkish, and
Chaldean were taught. In urging
their cultivation, he said he hoped
that he and his brethren would be
sent by the Lord to spread the Gospel
among the Turks.</p>

<p>When, after the expulsion of the
Medici, the Florentine signiory, on
account of the financial embarrassments
of the republic, resolved to sell
the Medicean library, there was great
danger that this magnificent accumulation,
then the most valuable collection
of Greek and Latin authors
known in Europe, and specially rich
in the most precious MSS., would be
either scattered or fall into the hands
of strangers. There was no private
citizen in Florence wealthy enough
to purchase it. Savonarola, who
fully appreciated its value, and who
had already brought up the library
of his own convent to a high standard,
making it accessible to all, and
the first free library in all Italy, resolved
that these treasures should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
leave the city. His first act of authority
as prior had been to enforce
the original rule of S. Dominic as
to the poverty of the order. The
saint’s last words were: “Be charitable,
preserve humility, practise
poverty with cheerfulness: may my
curse and that of God fall upon
him who shall bring possessions into
this order!” Nevertheless, under certain
so-called reformed rules, the
convent at Florence had adopted the
power of holding property, and its
wealth in landed possessions had
greatly accumulated. Savonarola’s
first reform was to enforce the practice
of poverty in the order, while
the absence of landed income was to
be supplied by the labors of the
monks and a yet more rigid economy.
It so happened that the sale of
the convent property, in pursuance of
this reform, had just been made, and
Savonarola had at his command a
sum of two thousand florins&mdash;a large
amount for that period. His convent
bought the library for three
thousand florins, paying two thousand
on account, and binding themselves
to liquidate the balance,
which was a claim held by a French
creditor, in eighteen months. This
transaction occurred precisely during
the period of the celebrated bonfire
of vanities, at which Savonarola is unjustly
charged with having destroyed
innumerable classical manuscripts.</p>

<p>Space fails us to speak of Savonarola
as a poet. Like many other boys,
he scribbled verses in his early youth,
and wrote a poem, <i>De Ruina Mundi</i>,
at the age of twenty. There is
something anticipatory of Byron in
the sadness and gloom of its tone:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Vedendo sotto sopra tutto il mondo,<br />
Ed esser spenta al fondo</p>

<p class="p1">We find in his youthful productions,
says Villari, “both vigor and poetic
talent, but united with negligence
of form.” Later in life, he wrote numerous
spiritual lauds, composed for
the purpose of counteracting and
taking the place of the degrading
carnival songs in vogue under the
Medici. As poetry, they possess no
special merit. Villari mentions several
of his canzoni, written when he
was a young man, and cites one in
praise of S. Catherine of Negri, in
three long stanzas of fifteen lines each,
in which he finds great delicacy and
exquisite tenderness of feeling. He
also refers to some of his Latin compositions
modelled on the Psalms,
which are eminently poetical. In
one of them, he celebrates the praises
of God, saying: “I sought thee
everywhere, but found thee not. I
asked the earth, Art thou my God?
and I was answered, Thou deceivest
thyself: I am not thy God. I asked
the air, and was answered, Ascend
still higher. I asked the sky, the sun,
the stars, and they all answered me,
He who made me out of nothing, he
is God; he fills the heavens and the
earth; he is in thy heart. I then, O
Lord, sought thee far off, and thou
wast near. I asked my eyes if thou
hadst entered by them, and they
answered, We know colors only. I
asked the ear, and was answered that
it knew sound only. The senses,
then, O Lord, knew thee not; thou
hast entered into my soul, thou art
in my heart, and thou makest manifest
thyself to me when I am performing
works of charity.”</p>

<p>Owing to his terribly earnest denunciation
of pagan excesses in poetry
and painting, and his indignation
at their imitation by Christians,
Savonarola has been held up as the
enemy of both poets and poetry, and
this even in his own day. To this
charge he replied in his work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
<i>The Division and Utility of all the
Sciences</i>, one part of which treats of
poetry. We select a few of its points.
He begins:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It never entered my mind to say a word
in condemnation of the art of poetry. I
condemned solely the abuse which many
had made of it, although I have been
calumniated on that account by many
persons, both in speaking and writing....
The essence of poetry is to be found
in philosophy. If any one believe that
the art of poetry teaches us only dactyls
and spondees, long and short syllables,
and the ornaments of speech, he has certainly
fallen into a great mistake....
The object of poetry is to persuade by
means of that syllogism called an example,
expressed with elegance of language,
so as to convince and, at the same time,
to delight us. And as our soul has supreme
delight in song and harmony, the
ancients contrived the measures of versification,
that, by such means, men might
be more readily excited to virtue. But
measure is mere form; and the poet may
produce a poem without metre and without
verse. This, in fact, is the case in
the Holy Scriptures, in which our Lord
makes true poetry consist in wisdom;
true eloquence in the spirit of truth;
hence, our minds are not occupied with the
outward letter, but are filled with the
spirit.” ... He then goes on to denounce
“a fallacious race of pretended poets, who
know no better than to tread in the footsteps
of the Greeks and Romans; keep
to the same form, the same metre; invoke
the same gods, nor venture to use any
other names or words than those they
find in the ancients.... This is not only
a false poetry, but one most pernicious to
youth. We find the heathens themselves
condemning such poets. Did not Plato
himself declare that a law ought to be
passed to expel those poets from the city
who, by the allurements of the most corrupting
verses, contaminate everything
with vile lusts and moral degradation?
What, then, are our Christian princes
about? Why do they not issue a law to
expel from their cities not only these
false poets, but their works also, and all
the works of ancient authors who have
written on libidinous subjects and praise
false gods? It would be well if all such
works were destroyed, and none were
allowed to remain except such as excite
to virtuous conduct.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is on such passages as these
that Savonarola’s enemies base their
charges of enmity to poetry, etc.
The charges are unfounded. His
æsthetic opinions were in harmony
with the purest principles of art, and
his sense of the true and the beautiful
was always acute. “In what
does beauty consist?” he asks, in one
of his sermons. “In colors? No. In
figures? No. Beauty results from
harmony in all the parts and colors.
This applies to composite subjects;
in simple subjects, beauty is in light.
Look at the sun and the stars&mdash;their
beauty is in light; behold the spirits
of the blessed&mdash;light constitutes their
beauty; raise your thoughts to the
Almighty&mdash;he is light and is beauty
itself. The beauty of man and woman
is greater and more perfect the
nearer it approaches to the primary
Beauty. But what, then, is this beauty?
It is a quality resulting from a
due proportion and harmony between
the several members and parts of the
body. You would never say that a
woman was handsome because she
had a fine nose and pretty hands;
but when her features harmonize.
Whence comes this beauty? Inquire,
and you will find it is from the soul.”</p>

<p>Addressing himself to women, he
said: “Ye women who glory in
your ornaments, in your head-dresses,
in your hands, I tell you that you
are all ugly! Would you see true
beauty? Observe a devout person,
man or woman, in whom the Spirit
dwells&mdash;observe such an one, I say,
while in the act of prayer, when the
countenance is suffused with divine
beauty, and the prayer is over. You
will then see the beauty of God reflected
in that face, and a countenance
almost angelic.”</p>

<p>We have thus endeavored, in referring
to Savonarola’s acquirements,
and by presenting him to our readers
in a variety of mental aspects, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
convey some idea of the moral, intellectual,
and æsthetic sides of his
character, in order that, as the story
of his life and the account of the exciting
incidents with which it is filled
progress in our pages, they may be the
better able to appreciate his action
by at least a partial knowledge of
his spiritual constitution and mental
resources. We resume, then, the
thread of our narrative.</p>

<p class="pc1">THE SERMON AT BOLOGNA.</p>

<p class="p1">Savonarola preached his usual
course of Lenten sermons in 1493,
not at Florence, but at Bologna. His
correspondence with his brother
friars at S. Mark’s during his absence
shows that he had gone there
unwillingly, and it is hence supposed
that Piero de’ Medici had brought
about his absence through orders
from his superiors at Milan and at
Rome. The friar confined his
preaching to subjects of doctrine and
morals, and at the outset attracted
but little public attention. The
<i>beaux esprits</i> set him down as “a
poor simpleton, a preacher for women”&mdash;<i>uomo
semplice e predicatore da
donne</i>. But his animation and sincerity
were contagious, and hearers
soon came in crowds. The tyrant
Giovanni Bentivoglio then ruled Bologna,
and his wife, an Orsini, appeared
at all the sermons, entering late,
and followed by a large retinue of
gentlemen, pages, and ladies&mdash;<i>gentildonne
e damizelle</i>. The silent rebuke
of stopping short in his sermon until
the disturbance thus caused had
subsided was tried by the preacher
several times in vain. He then referred
to the disedification given by
such interruptions, and mildly requested
that ladies who came to
hear the sermon should endeavor to
be present at its beginning. In response,
the haughty woman made a
point of continuing the annoyance
with offensive and increased ostentation,
until one morning, when thus
breaking in upon the friar while in
all the fervor of his discourse, his
patience gave way, and he cried out:
<i>Ecco, ecco il demonio che viene ad interrompere
il verbo di Dio</i>&mdash;“Behold
the demon who comes to interrupt
the word of God!” All the blood of
all the Orsinis boiled over at this public
insult. A reigning princess to be
thus treated by a mere <i>frate</i>! As
the story runs, she ordered two of
her attendants to slay him in the
pulpit; but whether their courage
failed them, or the crowd would not
permit them to reach the friar, they
did not carry out their order. Still
enraged, she sent two other satellites
to his cell, where Savonarola received
them with such dignity and impressive
calmness that their resolution
oozed away, and they said with great
respect: “Our lady has sent us to
your reverence to know if you had
need of anything.” To which
suitable and courteous reply being
made, they were dismissed. In his
closing sermon at Bologna, the
preacher announced: “This evening
I shall depart for Florence with
my slender staff and wooden flask,
and I shall sleep at Pianoro. If any
person want aught of me, let him
come before I set out. <i>My death is
not to be celebrated at Bologna, but
elsewhere.</i>”</p>

<p>The legend runs that it was on
this journey, when near to Florence,
that Savonarola, unable to take any
food and broken with fatigue, sank
by the roadside, powerless to go
further. Quickly there came to him
the vision of an unknown man, who,
giving him strength, accompanied
him to the city gate, and disappeared,
saying: “Remember that thou
doest that for which thou hast been
sent by God.” Each reader will decide
for himself as to the degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
credibility to be attached to such a
legend. Certain it is, nevertheless,
that Savonarola himself and many
men of the strongest minds of that
day fully believed in it.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p class="pc1">INDEPENDENCE OF S. MARK’S.</p>

<p class="p1">On his return to Florence in the
spring of 1493, Savonarola found a
worse state of things than he had
left on his departure. The rule of
Piero de’ Medici was rapidly becoming
every day less tolerable, and the
discontent of the people more marked
and bitter. One thing, however,
the people knew well. It was that
Savonarola was their friend. Piero
de’ Medici was also perfectly aware
of it, and, as he had the power, might
at any moment through his influence
have the Dominican prior ordered
away to Milan by his superiors in
Lombardy or Rome, as the Tuscan
convents formed one province with
those of Lombardy. This union had
been brought about some fifty years
before by reason of the depopulation
of the Tuscan convents from the
plague. As this state of things had
long ceased to exist, and the convents
were again full, it occurred to
Savonarola to seek the restoration of
the Tuscan convents to their original
condition of an independent province.
In his management of this
important and difficult piece of practical
business, there was nothing
whatever of the visionary monk,
and he set to work with all his energy
to carry out a measure in which he
felt that the purity and elevation of
his order and the liberties of the
Florentine people were at stake.
The authorization for the measure he
desired must of course come from
Rome, and, in order to obtain it, he
sent thither two of his friars, Alessandro
Rinuccini, a member of one
of the most illustrious families of
Florence, and Domenico da Pescia.
The latter in particular was unreservedly
devoted to his prior, ardent
in his admiration of him, and fully
persuaded that he was a prophet
sent by God. On arriving at their
destination, they encountered a formidable
opposition. Not only the
Lombards, but the King of Naples,
the republic of Genoa, the Dukes of
Milan and Ferrara, and Bentivoglio
of Bologna, all joined in striving for
the defeat of the petition. Strangely
enough&mdash;and it is mentioned by
historians as an evidence of his frivolous
mind and inattention to serious
matters&mdash;Piero de’ Medici had been
persuaded to favor a measure of
which the main object was to free
S. Mark’s and its prior from his authority.
In fact, Savonarola could
not have advanced a step without
obtaining his approbation, inasmuch
as the application of the convent as
made could not be allowed to be
presented without the approbation
of the Florentine government. In
bringing about this important success,
Savonarola had the assistance
of Philip Valori, and John, Cardinal
de’ Medici, a brother of Piero, who
afterwards became Pope Leo X.
While at Rome, the general of the
Dominicans and Cardinal Caraffa
of Naples warmly supported him.
Nevertheless, the two friars of S.
Mark’s who had been sent to Rome
were dispirited by the formidable
aspect of the opposition they there
encountered, and wrote to their prior
that success was impossible, and he
must give up all hope of carrying
his point. Savonarola’s reply was:
“Away with doubts! Stand firm,
and you will be victorious; the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
scatters the councils of the nations,
and casts the designs of princes to
the ground.” In a consistory of the
22d of May, the Tuscan question
came up, but the pope refused to
approve the brief, and dismissed the
consistory until the following day.
All the cardinals departed with the
exception of Caraffa, who took the
liveliest interest in the success of the
measure, and had a strong personal
influence with Alexander VI. They
entered into a friendly conversation,
during which the cardinal produced
the brief, and asked the pope to
sign it. With a smile, he declined;
when, presuming on his personal familiarity,
and in a half-jesting manner,
Caraffa took the pontifical
ring from the pope’s finger, and sealed
the brief. Just then, in hot haste,
came in fresh and stronger remonstrances
from Lombardy, but the
pope replied that it was too late&mdash;“What
is done is done”; and he
would hear no more of it.</p>

<p>Savonarola’s first care was to reform
and strengthen the discipline of
his convent, and it was at this juncture
that he brought it back to the
original rule of poverty established
by the founder of the order, as we
have already stated. Then followed
the enforcement of the strictest personal
economy, the acquisition and
practice of useful arts by the monks
whereby to earn their livelihood, and
the study of the oriental languages.
In all his conventual reforms, the
new prior taught by example as
much as by precept. His monks
saw that he inculcated no principle
of which he was not a living model.
Sober in his diet, ascetic in all his
habits, of an application to study
that seemed to know no fatigue, he
inspired all by his labor and self-denial.
In all the whole convent, the
humblest monk was not more poorly
clad than his prior. No cell so naked,
no pallet so hard, as his. Rigid
with others, he was severe with himself.
Numerous candidates presented
themselves for admission to the
Convent of S. Mark, which was now
the admiration of all Tuscany. The
sons of the most distinguished families
in Florence sought to become
inmates of S. Mark’s, and the Rucellai,
the Salviati, the Albizzi, the Strozzi,
and even the Medici, pressed into
the narrow limits of the crowded
convent, in order to receive at the
hands of Savonarola the robe of S.
Dominic. Additional buildings were
absolutely necessary, and those of
the Sapienza were obtained&mdash;the
same that were a few years since
used for the stables of the grand
duke.</p>

<p>Under the brief lately obtained
from Rome, the Dominican convents
of Fiesole, Prato, and Bibbiena, and
the two hospices of the Maddalena,
asked for reception into the Tuscan
congregation under Savonarola’s authority,
and were admitted. Even
the friars of another order, the
Camaldoli, were desirous of uniting
themselves with S. Mark’s, in order to
be under the rule of Savonarola; but
he could not accede to their request,
for want of authority. All this success
and honor did not in the slightest
degree affect his character. If,
during his career, he manifested pride
and daring, it was towards the great
and powerful. In private life, and
in the interior of his convent, he was
to the end the same gentle and
humble brother the monks had
known as Fra Girolamo.</p>

<p class="pc1">ADVENT, 1493.</p>

<p class="p1">It was natural, under the circumstances,
that the Superior of the
Tuscan Congregation of Dominicans,
the preacher whose predictions had
been so wonderfully verified, the exemplary
monk who had been called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
to the bedside of the dying Lorenzo
the Magnificent, should enter upon
the delivery of his course of Advent
sermons for 1493 with increased
confidence and far greater freedom
of speech than the comparatively unknown
Fra Girolamo had ever manifested.
His audiences grew daily
more numerous, and crowds awaited
for hours his coming. The twenty-five
sermons of this course were
on the Seventy-third Psalm (<i>Quam
Bonus</i>). His principal topics were
the unhappy and ruinous condition
of the church, the immoral lives of
the Italian princes and many of the
higher clergy, approaching punishments,
and the desire of all good men
to stem the rising tide of depravity.
We have already cited the passages
(“They tickle the ears with Aristotle,
etc.,” and “In the houses of the great
prelates”) in which he denounces
the clergy and hierarchy; and he
thus describes the princes of Italy:
“These wicked princes are sent as a
punishment for the sins of their subjects;
they are truly a great snare for
souls; their palaces and halls are the
refuge of all the beasts and monsters
of the earth, and are a shelter for
caitiffs and for every kind of wickedness.
Such men resort to their courts
because there they find the means
and the excitements to give vent to
all their evil passions. There we find
the wicked counsellors who devise
new burdens and new imposts for
sucking the blood of the people;
there we find the flattering philosophers
and poets who, by a thousand
stories and lies, trace the genealogy
of those wicked princes from the
gods; and, what is still worse, there
we find priests who adopt the same
language. That, my brethren, is the
city of Babylon, the city of the
foolish and the impious, the city
which the Lord will destroy.”</p>

<p>And then, after speaking sharply
of a superfluity of golden mitres
and golden chalices, he adds: “But
dost thou know what I would say?
In the primitive church, there were
wooden chalices and golden prelates;
but now the church has golden chalices
and wooden prelates....”</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“What doest thou, O Lord? Why
slumberest thou? Arise and take the
church out of the hands of the devil, out
of the hands of tyrants, out of the hands
of wicked prelates. Hast thou forgotten
thy church? Dost thou not love her?
Hast thou no care for her? We are become,
O Lord, the opprobrium of the
nations. Turks are masters of Constantinople.
We are become tributaries of infidels.
O Lord God! thou hast dealt
with us as an angry father; thou hast
banished us from thee; hasten the punishment
and the scourge, that there may
be a speedy return to thee. <i>Effunde iras
tuas in gentes</i>&mdash;’Pour out thy wrath upon
the nations.’ Be not scandalized, my
brethren, by these words; rather consider
that, when the good wish for punishment,
it is because they wish to see evil driven
away, and the blessed reign of Jesus
Christ triumphant throughout the world.
We have now no other hope left us, unless
the sword of the Lord threatens the
earth.”</p>

<p class="pc1">THE DELUGE.</p>

<p class="p1">In Lent, 1494, Savonarola resumed
his preaching in a course of sermons
which, as published, have been
entitled <i>Sermons on Noe’s Ark</i>
(<i>Prediche sopra l’Arca di Noé</i>). It
was, in fact, a continuation of the
expounding of Genesis begun in
1490. The impression produced by
them upon his auditors was very great.
All the biographers unite in describing
how the people were carried
away, the wonder he excited, and
how marvellously all that was foretold
came to pass. His Advent sermons
had dwelt on the near approach
of punishments&mdash;a coming
deluge of calamities&mdash;and he now
constructs a mystical ark in which all
may take refuge. He prophesied
the approach of a new Cyrus who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
should conquer Italy without resistance.
At length, on Easter morning,
his ark being completed, he invited
all to hasten to enter it with the
virtues which distinguish Christians:
“The time will come when the ark
will be closed, and many will repent
that they had not entered therein.”
Thus the short chapter of Genesis
relating to the ark occupied the
whole of Lent, and he resumed the
subject in the month of September
following. On the twenty-first day of
that month, he was to expound the
seventeenth verse, relating to the
Deluge.</p>

<p>The Dome of Florence was crowded.
All waited for the sermon in
anxiety and excitement, but attentive
and motionless. Mounting the
pulpit, and surveying the multitude
in impressive silence for a few moments,
he thundered out: “And behold,
I, even I, do bring a flood of
waters upon the earth.” A thrill of
terror convulsed the vast assemblage.
Pico di Mirandola relates that a
cold shiver ran through all his bones,
and that the hairs of his head stood
on end; and Savonarola has recorded
that he was profoundly moved.
That very day the news had arrived
that a horde of foreign troops were
descending the Alps to conquer
Italy, and popular credulity made
their numbers countless, invincible in
arms, gigantic, cruel, and ferocious.
“Having, before the arrival of the
King of France, just closed the ark,
these sermons caused such terror,
alarm, sobbing, and tears, that every
one passed through the streets without
speaking, more dead than alive.”
(<i>MS. history in Magliabecchian library.</i>)
Terror there was indeed. Italy
was helpless. There was neither nation
nor national army. The princes
were defenceless, and the whole
country must fall an easy prey to the
invader. Men saw rivers of blood
before them. What could save
them? All rushed to Savonarola,
imploring counsel and help. He
alone could succor them. All his
words had been verified. All those
whose deaths he foretold had gone
to their graves. Punishment threatened
had begun. The sword of the
Lord had indeed descended upon
the earth. Not only the people
flocked about him, but the graver
men and magistrates of Florence
asked his counsel, and his admirers
and adherents became in a moment,
as if by magic, the rulers of the
city.</p>

<p>Here may be said to terminate
the monastic life of Savonarola, and,
in order to follow his career, we must
with him quit the cloister, and accompany
him among the people of
Florence down in the public places.</p>

<p class="pc1">FROM THE FRENCH OF CHARLES DUBOIS.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="pc1 reduct">PERHAPS PROPHETIC.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the first time for many weeks
that Louis had met Eugénie alone.
He felt greatly excited, and naturally
said to himself: “Ought I to
manifest any appearance of avoiding
her?... Or, on the contrary, shall
I keep on? Any avoidance might
make her think unfavorably of me....
But would it be prudent to
speak to her?...” While thus debating
with himself, he looked at
Eugénie as she advanced towards
him, handsome and dignified as ever,
and as calm as he was agitated.
He still kept on, yielding to an irresistible
attraction without bringing
himself to an account for it. As he
advanced, he recalled how Françoise
had praised her. “That dear woman,”
he said, “could have no interest
in deceiving me. A soul so
upright and pure could only tell the
truth. And who has had a better
opportunity of knowing Mlle. Eugénie?...
Well, I must study this
unique girl a little more!... I
will speak to her!... I have judged
her too severely. I must learn
her real nature. I must show her
what I am. She has, I am sure,
conceived some suspicion about me
which she may already regret. At
all events, my line of conduct here
is plainly marked out. I am resolved
to regain her esteem, and obtain
her assistance in the good I am
doing, in order that it may be done
more effectually and speedily. Now
is the time to make the attempt!...”</p>

<p>As he said this to himself, he
met Eugénie. She did not appear at
all embarrassed as he advanced to
speak to her, but said, in a frank, natural
tone: “You have been to see
my patient; she spoke of you yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mademoiselle; I have just
come from there. I do not think
she will need our assistance long.
Poor woman, or rather, happy woman,
she is at last going to receive
the reward she so well deserves!...
But how many others there are still
to be aided when she is gone!...
There is so much wretchedness
whichever way we turn! If there
were only more like you, mademoiselle,
to look after the poor!”</p>

<p>“And you also, monsieur. My
father has told me something of your
plans. I will not speak of my approval:
my approbation is of little
value; but I assure you they please
me. Above all, I hope you will not
allow yourself to be discouraged by
difficulties you are likely to meet
with.”</p>

<p>“I hope, with the help of God, to
overcome them, mademoiselle. But
the efforts of an isolated individual
like myself are of little avail, especially
when one has had no more
experience and is no richer than I.”</p>

<p>These words were uttered in a
tone of frankness and simplicity that
produced a lively impression on Eugénie.
“If he is sincere in what he
says,” said she to herself, “my suspicions
about him are unjust; but
this frankness and simplicity of manner
are perhaps subtle means of
blinding my eyes.” She therefore
remained on her guard. “Ah!
monsieur, it is not money alone we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
should give the poor! What they
need, above all, is advice, which you
are much better fitted to give than I
who have had no experience of life.”</p>

<p>There was a tinge of irony in these
last words that did not escape Louis,
but he pretended not to observe it.</p>

<p>“I do not think,” said he, “that
I have had as much experience as
you suppose, mademoiselle. However,
a Christian seeks aid from a
different source than the insufficient
arsenal of human experience. What
we should, above all, remind the poor
of, what we should induce them to
love, are the precepts of religion
which they may have forgotten and
no longer practise for want of knowing
their value.”</p>

<p>“You are very pious, it seems,
monsieur,” she said, in a slight tone
of raillery.</p>

<p>“I must put an end to this,” said
Louis to himself. “She seems to regard
me as a hypocrite. I will
prove to her I am not. If she refuses
to believe me, her persistency in
such odious and unjust suspicions will
redound to her own injury.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” said he, “I am
not very pious, but I desire to be so,
or rather to become so again, for I
was as long as my mother lived.
She was taken away too soon for my
good, for I had need of her counsels
and guidance. I have realized it
since! You have doubtless had an
account of my life. It may be summed
up in three words: folly, despair,
and return to God. I dare
not pledge my word that this return
is irrevocable: I have given too
many proofs of weakness to rely on
myself. God, who has brought me
back to himself, can alone give me
the necessary strength to remain
faithful to him. But if I cannot
promise ever to falter again, I can at
least venture to declare that my conversion
is sincere&mdash;so sincere that,
having lost all I had, I regard this
loss as extremely fortunate, for it
was, in God’s providence, the means
of leading me back to the faith.
Such a benefit can never be too
dearly purchased!”</p>

<p>Louis kept his eyes fastened on
Eugénie as he spoke. She looked
up more than once; the expression
of his face and the tone of his voice
were so evidently those of an honest
man, that she felt all her doubts give
way.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said she, “I do not
know as I should reproach myself
for what I said with regard to your
piety, though I perceive it has
wounded you, for it has led to an
explanation on your part which....”</p>

<p>“Which has made me happy,” was
what Eugénie was about to say, but
she stopped quite confused as she
bethought herself of the interpretation
he might give to her words.</p>

<p>Louis comprehended her embarrassment;
he saw her fears, and
came to her aid. “Which you
thought necessary, mademoiselle,”
suggested he. “I can understand
that. It is rather a rare phenomenon
to see a young man pass from
dissipation to piety.”</p>

<p>Eugénie immediately recovered
her usual serenity. “Well, monsieur,”
said she, “now I know your intentions
and projects; I assure you my
mother and myself will second them
as much as is in our power. What
is there we can do?”</p>

<p>“Tell me what charitable offices
you like the least, mademoiselle, or
what you find too difficult to perform.”</p>

<p>“That is admirable! We have
often longed for a representative, a
substitute, who could effect what we
were unable to do. But how can
we otherwise aid you?”</p>

<p>“You are kind enough, then, to
allow me to be the medium of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
alms. It is a pleasant office to receive
contributions for the benefit of
others, especially from people as benevolent
as you, mademoiselle. I
accept the post with lively gratitude,
and will at once ask you for some
good books for the library I have
established for the workmen.”</p>

<p>“I will bring you twenty volumes
to-morrow that are of no use to me,
and are exactly what you want.”</p>

<p>Louis and Eugénie then separated.
The interview was short, but it led
to the very points which enabled
them to study and appreciate each
other better than they could have
done in two hours in a <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p>That evening, Louis appeared to
his workmen more cheerful and social
than usual. He was at last sure
of gaining Eugénie’s esteem. Without
acknowledging it to himself, he
already loved her to such a degree
that he was extremely desirous of revealing
himself to her under an aspect
more and more favorable. This is
loving worthily and heartily.</p>

<p>As to Eugénie, when she entered
the presence of the poor woman she
went to visit, she could not resist the
desire of speaking again of Louis. An
instinctive, perhaps superstitious, feeling
made her believe, as well as he,
that this woman, who was dying in
so pious a frame of mind after so
heroic a life, could not be mistaken
in her opinion. “So pure a soul
ought to be able to read clearly the
hearts of those around her,” she said
to herself.</p>

<p>“Has M. Beauvais been here
to-day, Mère Françoise?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, mademoiselle. I am glad
you spoke of him. I do not expect
to see him again in this world, and
was so taken up with a favor I had
to ask him that I forgot to express
my gratitude for all his kindness to
me. Every day he has brought me
something new; but that is the least
of his benefits. I particularly wished
to express my thanks for all the good
he has done me by his conversation.
Ah! mademoiselle, how I wish you
could hear him speak of God, the
misery of this world, and the joys of
heaven! If I die happy, it is owing
to him. Before he came to see me,
I was afraid of death. However
poor we may be, we cling to life so
strongly!... Thanks to him, I now
feel I cannot die too soon.... I
have told M. le Curé all this, and he
made me promise to pray for one
who has so successfully come to his
aid. When I reach heaven, I shall
pray for him and for you, mademoiselle.
You have both been so kind
to me. Promise to tell him all this.”</p>

<p>This testimony, so spontaneous
and heart-felt, from a dying person,
with regard to Louis’ goodness and
piety, and this union of their names
in the expression of her gratitude,
produced a profound and lasting
impression on the tender, romantic
soul of Eugénie. All the way home
she dwelt on what had occurred. She
began to reproach herself for her
suspicions&mdash;suspicions now vanished.
It was not that she loved Louis, or
even had an idea she might love
him, but her noble mind had a horror
of the injustice she had been guilty
of towards an innocent and unfortunate
man. “I will repair it,” she
said to herself, “by faithfully keeping
the promise I made him.”</p>

<p>That very evening, she spoke of
Louis to her father and mother, repeating
the conversation she had had
with him, and expressing a wish to
co-operate in the good work he was
undertaking. “It is a work in which
we cannot refuse our sympathy,” she
said, “for its object is to ameliorate
the condition of our workmen&mdash;a
question that has preoccupied us all
for a long time.”</p>

<p>Eugénie’s object in this was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
induce her parents to express their
opinion of Louis. She particularly
wished to ascertain Mr. Smithson’s
sentiments. He was almost an infallible
judge, in his daughter’s estimation,
and therefore it was with sincere
deference she awaited his reply. It
was the first time she had forced him
to give his opinion of Louis, or that
there had ever been any serious
question concerning him in the family
circle.</p>

<p>“My child,” said Mr. Smithson,
“M. Louis means well, I think. He
seems to be a considerate person, or
at least tries to be. I approve of
your wish to aid him in collecting a
library; but, if he proposes your joining
him in any other benevolent
enterprise, you must consult me before
coming to any decision. This
young man, I say, has good qualities,
but he is a little enthusiastic. His
ardor just now needs moderating;
after a while, it may be necessary to
revive it. Let him go on. We will
aid him when we can be of service,
but must be a little on our
guard.”</p>

<p>The oracle had spoken. Eugénie
reflected on what had been said. It
was evident that Louis inspired her
father with some distrust. Mr.
Smithson, according to his habit, left
his wife and daughter at an early
hour to work in his office.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="pc1 reduct">A QUESTION.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Eugenie</span>, being left alone with her
mother, resolved to obtain, if possible,
some light on the question her
father’s words had excited in her
mind. She felt anxious to know
why he distrusted Louis. He was
now a subject of interest to her.
This was not all: she had begun by
judging him unfavorably; then she
reversed her opinion. Now she had
come to the point of wishing to repair
her secret wrongs against him
without his being aware of it....
But should she carry out her wish,
or, on the contrary, return to her
past antipathy?... On the one
hand was the impression left by her
interview with Louis; on the other,
the depressing state of doubt produced
by her father’s reticence. She
was one of those persons who prefer
certainty to doubt, whatever it may
be. “My mother must be aware of
my father’s real sentiments,” she said
to herself; “I will ask her.” Nothing
was easier. Mme. Smithson and
her daughter lived on a footing of
affectionate equality that I do not
exactly approve of, but which excludes
all restraint.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Eugénie, “give
me a sincere reply to what I am going
to ask. What do you think of
M. Louis?”</p>

<p>“You are greatly interested in
this M. Louis, then? You talk of
nothing else this evening. What is
the reason? Hitherto you have
paid no attention to him.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am interested in him. I
have been studying him. You know
I have a mania for deciphering everybody.
Well, he is still an enigma.
Yet I am sure of one thing: he is a
man to be thoroughly esteemed or
despised, not half-way. In a word,
he is that rare thing&mdash;a character.
Only, is he a noble or a contemptible
character?... The question is
a serious one. I wish to solve it,
but cannot with the light I now
have.”</p>

<p>“Well done! here is some more
of your customary exaggeration!
Of what consequence is it, my dear,
what he is? He has come here for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
well-known reasons. Your father
was tired of attending to all the details
of the manufactory, and employs
him to take charge of essential
though secondary duties. He pays
him a very high salary&mdash;too high, in
my estimation&mdash;but he is pleased,
delighted with his aptitude and activity;
that is all I care for.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, that is not enough
for me. I repeat: M. Louis is different
from most men, mother. He is
a man, and the rest are only puppets.”</p>

<p>“Really! I should not have suspected
it. He seems to me quite
commonplace.”</p>

<p>“But not to me.”</p>

<p>“What can you see in him so remarkable?”</p>

<p>“He has, or at least appears to
have, an elevation of mind and constancy
of purpose that are striking.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear, you make me
laugh. Really, if all the gentlemen
you see would only adapt themselves
a little to your humor, there is not
one you could not turn into a hero
of romance.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. The proof is that
I have hitherto only seen men unworthy
of any serious consideration.
When did I ever acknowledge I had
found a man of character such as I
would like to see?...”</p>

<p>“And you think M. Louis this
white blackbird?”</p>

<p>“I really do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I confess you astonish me.
I never should have dreamed of
your noticing him. Perhaps you
have taken a fancy to him.”</p>

<p>“Mother, we are accustomed to
think aloud before each other. I do
not fancy him&mdash;understand that&mdash;in
the least. I do not even believe I
ever could fancy him. This does
not prevent me from thinking him, as
I said, different from other men.
Whether in good or ill, he differs
from young men of his age. But is
he better or worse?&mdash;that is the
question&mdash;a serious one I would like
to have answered. Till to-day, I
have thought him worse.”</p>

<p>“It is not possible! The poor fellow
has committed some errors, as I
have told you. I certainly do not
wish to palliate them, but we must
not be more severe than God himself:
he always pardons.”</p>

<p>“It is not a question of his sins.”</p>

<p>“What is the question, then?
You keep me going from one surprise
to another this evening.”</p>

<p>“It is a question of knowing if he
is the man he pretends to be&mdash;that
is, one who has forsaken his errors,
acknowledges he has gone astray,
repents, and resolves to live henceforth
in a totally different manner.
If he is such a man; if he can resign
himself courageously to his modest
situation here, and, moreover, has
the noble desire of comforting the
afflicted, instructing the ignorant,
and reclaiming those who have gone
astray, I tell you M. Louis is
worthy of the highest esteem; we
ought to encourage and aid him
with all our might. But if he is not
the man I think&mdash;if these fine projects
are only a lure, an artful means....”</p>

<p>“A means of doing what?...
Goodness! Eugénie, you get bewildered
with your fancies. Do you
imagine he wishes to revolutionize
the establishment, and supplant your
father?...”</p>

<p>“Let us not exaggerate things,
I beg, mother. What I wished you
to understand was a delicate point.
I hoped you would guess it from a
word. Come, have you no suspicion
of what so greatly troubles me?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!... I am astonished.
Well, may he not manifest all this
zeal, and affect all these airs of disinterested
benevolence, to bring
about a secret project?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>“What one, I ask you again?
When you go to dreaming impossibilities,
you know I can never follow
you. Explain yourself clearly.”</p>

<p>“Well, since I am forced to call
things by their right names, is he not
aiming at my hand?”</p>

<p>“What a droll idea!... Why,
he has not a sou left! Everybody
knows that. He spent his property
in six or seven years, and has nothing
more to expect for a long time.
So you believe he resolved to become
religious, thinking that would be
sufficient capital, in Mr. Smithson’s
eyes, to obtain his daughter? I
think he has too much sense to imagine
anything so absurd; especially
to give it a serious thought.”</p>

<p>“But if he hoped to please me by
this means?... to win my esteem,
my good will, my affection?...”</p>

<p>“All romance that, my dear.”</p>

<p>“But not impossible.”</p>

<p>“I prefer to think, for my own
peace of mind and your father’s, that
things will turn out differently.
We have never intended you to marry
a man without property. The
idea of your having a husband who,
instead of being wealthy, has squandered
all he had, and might spend
what you brought him!...”</p>

<p>“Ah! I understand you: you do
not think him sincere.”</p>

<p>“I do not say that! He may be
changed for the present, but who
can be sure his conversion will be
lasting?”</p>

<p>“It will if it is sincere; I am
sure of that, for I have studied him.
He possesses one quality which I
either admire or detest, according to
the use made of it: he has a strong
will. He has been here a month,
and, having nothing better to do, I
have observed him, and have not
discovered a single inconsistency in
his conduct. He has always shown,
exteriorly at least, the same love of
labor, the same desire of doing all
the good he can, and the same unassuming
deportment. Either he is a
man of rare excellence, or is uncommonly
artful. I wish I knew exactly
what my father thinks of him.”</p>

<p>“And why this persistency in discovering
a mystery of so little importance?”</p>

<p>“Because I do not wish to despise
M. Louis if he is worthy of esteem,
and it would be wrong not to encourage
him in well-doing if he has
entered on that path with a sincere
heart. Besides, I regard what he has
undertaken and all he wishes to do
as admirable as it is useful. I had
been wishing for such an attempt to
be made here, and could not be better
pleased than to see my idea so speedily
realized. M. Louis is, in my eyes,
either a saint or a hypocrite. I have
no fancy for loving either the one or
the other; but, if he is a saint, I should
feel like aiding him to a certain degree.
After all, mother, is there anything
in the world more desirable
than to do good to those around us,
especially when we are so situated
as to make it a duty? Have you
not often said so yourself?”</p>

<p>“You are right, my dear Eugénie.
I feel what you say, and approve of
it. As I advance in years, I feel a
constantly increasing desire of laboring
for Almighty God, for whom I
have hitherto done so little. You
need not fear; neither your father
nor I have any doubts as to M.
Louis. Nothing we have observed
or have been told leads us to think
him a hypocrite. As you desire it
so strongly, I will tell you your father’s
secret opinion, but do not betray
me. He only dislikes one thing
in M. Louis: he is too devoted a
Catholic. It is all in vain: we cannot
induce your father to like our religion.
Catholics are too ardent
every way, too superstitious, he says.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
He distrusts the engineer because
he thinks him overzealous, that is
all....”</p>

<p>When Eugénie went to her chamber,
she selected the books she wished
to contribute to Louis’ library,
and then retired to rest, thinking of
all the good that would now be done
by him, as well as herself, in a place
where want and every evil passion
were to be found. Her noble, ardent
soul had at length found its sphere.
Hitherto she had dreamed of many
ways of giving a useful direction to
her activity, each one more impracticable
than the rest. The right way
was now open. Louis had pointed
it out. Eugénie longed to become
the benefactress of St. M&mdash;&mdash;. Her
imagination and her heart were
pleased. It seemed to her as if she
had become another being. She
prayed that night with a fervor she
had not felt for a long time. Then
she fell into a reverie. In spite of
herself, Louis’ image continually recurred
to her mind. Before she fell
asleep, she murmured a prayer for
poor Françoise. Her name recalled
the last words of that excellent woman:
“In heaven, I shall pray for
him and for you!” And circumstances
were tending that same day to
link them together as the dying woman
had joined their names in prayer.
There was something singular
about this that struck Eugénie’s imagination.
“Can her words be prophetic?”
she said to herself. “So
many strange things happen!...
But this would be too much. He
pleases me in no way except....”
And she reviewed his good qualities,
then blushed for attaching so much
importance to the thought....</p>

<p>The next morning, she went with
the books she had selected the night
before. Fanny accompanied her.
Louis received her with the exquisite
politeness he never laid aside but
with a cold reserve he had resolved
to maintain towards her. Their interview
only lasted a few minutes.
Fanny, who had been easy for some
time, was greatly astonished when
asked to accompany her mistress to
the engineer’s office. Their conversation
showed they had recently
seen each other, but under what circumstances
she could not make out.
All this redoubled her suspicions.
On her way home with Eugénie,
she remarked:</p>

<p>“That M. Louis is a charming
young man; more so than I had
supposed. What respect he showed
mademoiselle! I am sure mademoiselle
judges him with less severity
than she did several weeks ago.”</p>

<p>“I have never judged him with
severity,” replied Eugénie, with that
lofty coolness which made those who
did not know her accuse her of pride.
“Why should I judge M. Beauvais?
that is my father’s business.”</p>

<p>Fanny returned to the assault:
“That is a queer notion of his to
wish to instruct all those ignorant
people. Much good will it do them!
The more they know, the more dangerous
they will be!...”</p>

<p>“Fanny, you should address such
observations to M. Louis or my
father. It is they who have founded
the library and school, and they intend
doing many other things without
consulting you, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“Common people sometimes give
good advice.”</p>

<p>“But they should give it to those
who need it. All this does not concern
me, I tell you again.”</p>

<p>“O the deceitful girl!” said Fanny
to herself when alone in her chamber
that night. “I always said she
would deceive me. Where could
she have seen him?... Is she
already in love with him?... She
is capable of it! But I will watch
her narrowly, and, if it is not too late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
will counteract her projects! I have
a good deal to contend with, however.
This M. Louis is an artful
fellow. And on the other hand, it is
no easy matter to lead Mlle. Eugénie....
I only hope she is not yet in
love with him!... If she were to
marry him instead of her cousin, I
should go distracted.... Poor Albert!
if he knew what is going on
here. Fortunately, I am on the spot
to watch over his interests. And
there is more reason than ever to be
on the lookout.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class="pc1 reduct">LOVE WITHOUT HOPE.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Louis</span> came to see us as often as
his occupations allowed. He made
us a long call the very day after Eugénie
gave him the books for his
library, and seemed more excited
than usual. He related his conversation
with Mr. Smithson, and spoke
of his pleasure at meeting Eugénie
and regaining her good opinion by a
frank explanation of his plans and
the motives by which he was influenced.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Victor, “does she
continue to please you?”</p>

<p>“More than I wish.”</p>

<p>“Why this regret?”</p>

<p>“It is only reasonable. My happiness
is involved in being pleased
with her.”</p>

<p>“Come, I see we shall not be able
to agree on this point.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear friend; the more I
reflect, the plainer it is that I ought
not to become attached to her; at
least, to make her aware of it, should
such a misfortune happen. But I
will not conceal it from you: I fear
I already love her....”</p>

<p>“You are decidedly tenacious in
your notions. Why do you torture
yourself with scruples that are evidently
exaggerated?...”</p>

<p>“All your friendly reasonings are
of no avail. However disinterested
my love might be, it would seem to
her only the result of calculation;
this is enough to justify me in my
apprehensions.”</p>

<p>“I cannot agree with you. Delicacy
of sentiment is a noble thing,
but it must not be carried to excess.
I am willing you should conceal
your love for her till you can prove
it sincere; that is, not the result of
calculation&mdash;I will go still further:
till the time comes when they voluntarily
render homage to the nobleness
of your intentions. But when
that day comes, and you see that
Mlle. Eugénie esteems and loves
you....”</p>

<p>“She will never love me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Mlle. Smithson has rare qualities
which make her the realization of all
my dreams, but I see I am not pleasing
to her. Before any change in
her sentiments is possible, she will
have another suitor with more to
offer her than I, and without a past
like mine to frustrate his hopes. He
will please her, and I can only withdraw.
Well, I confess I wish to reserve
one consolation for that day,
feeble as it may be&mdash;the satisfaction
of being able to say to myself: “She
did not know I loved her.”</p>

<p>“My poor friend, you take too
gloomy a view of the future.”</p>

<p>“Do not imagine my fears will result
in a dangerous melancholy. I
realize more fully than you may suppose
the advantages of my present
position. I might at this very moment
be in another world&mdash;a world
of despair.... To us Christians,
such a thought is full of horror. Instead
of that, I see the possibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
repairing the past, and of doing some
good. When I compare my present
life with that I was leading a year
ago, the favorable contrast makes me
happy! I had discarded the faith,
lost the esteem of upright men, and
given myself up to ignoble pleasures!&mdash;useless
to the world, an object
of disgust to myself. I had not the
courage to look at myself as I was.
How all that is changed! How happy
I ought to be!... But, no; the heart
of man is at once weak and insatiable.
At a time when I ought to be
happy, I am so weak as to yield to
a love I should have denied myself.
If I cannot overcome it, it will be a
source of new regret. I know there
is one means of safety, or perhaps
there is&mdash;that of flight.... But, no;
I will not, I cannot thus ensure a
selfish security. It would be cowardly
to recede before the noble work
God has assigned me. There is no
doubt now as to my future usefulness
at Mr. Smithson’s. I could not find
elsewhere the same facilities for doing
the good I long to effect. I will remain....”</p>

<p>“I will not assert it would be
cowardly to leave, but a man as
courageous as you are and have
need to be ought to remain at his
post at whatever cost. Like you, I
believe that is the post to which God
himself has called you.”</p>

<p>“I shall remain.... You cannot
imagine how happy I am there
when my heart is not agitated. Provisions
are dear this year, and we
have quite a number of hands forced
by want to leave Paris. These two
things combined have produced unusual
demoralization among the men
we employ. Some give themselves
up to drunkenness by way of relief;
others, listening to the evil suggestions
of hunger, conceive an inward
hatred against those who are rich.
There are a few ringleaders, and a
good many disaffected men, all ready
to yield to the most criminal proposals.
Mr. Smithson is aware of this,
and therefore fully approves of my
plan for the amelioration of so mixed
a set. I must do him the justice to
acknowledge he has been generous.
His wife and daughter are still more
so. I shall therefore remain as long
as I can. I only beseech God for
one favor&mdash;to bless my efforts, and
give me the courage necessary to
make the great sacrifice if it be required....”</p>

<p>“Ah! then you really love Mlle.
Smithson. I thought at the most
you were only afraid of loving her.”</p>

<p>“No; I will no longer keep this
secret to myself; it is too great a
burden to bear alone. Besides, this
concealment would not be worthy
of either of us. I was still in doubt
this morning, but have since read the
state of my heart more clearly. And
this is what enabled me to do so:</p>

<p>“I returned home from church
this morning with Mlle. Eugénie and
her mother. The church, you know,
is a kilometre and a half from the
mill, but the road is delightful. On
coming out of church, Mme. Smithson,
who is an excellent woman, and
quite pleasant and easy in her manners,
invited me, as it were, to accompany
them. Mlle. Eugénie at first
remained apart with her waiting-maid,
but still near enough to hear
what we said. We first discussed the
things suitable to give the poor, and
the utility of familiar conversation
with them in their houses. I expressed
a determination to perform this
act of charity as often as possible.
I begged Mme. Smithson to mention
the families she thought it advisable
to visit in this way, as she knows
them better than I. She promised
to give me a list. Mlle. Eugénie
then drew near, and said she would
add a few names to it; then, taking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
part in the conversation, and even
directing it with the grace she shows
in everything, she spoke in turn of
charity, religion, and literature with
an elevation of thought and in such
beautiful language that it was a
pleasure to listen to her. From time
to time we stopped to look, now at
one object, and then at another&mdash;the
large trees by the wayside, the
bushes, or the cottages. Mlle. Smithson
found something charming to say
of everything. We were half an hour
in going a distance we might have
accomplished in twenty minutes&mdash;a
delightful half-hour, but it had its
bitterness, as all my joys will henceforth
have. I see it is the will of
God that I should expiate my
offences. Like you, I am persuaded
that the privilege of doing good&mdash;the
most desirable of all privileges&mdash;is
only to be purchased at the price of
suffering.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Victor; “but at the
price of what suffering? Who can
assure you it is that of which you
are thinking?... That is a secret
known only to God.”</p>

<p>“That is true, but I am sure I
had to-day a foretaste of the suffering
I allude to. She was there beside
me&mdash;that beautiful young girl who
would be a model of feminine excellence
did she not lack one quality&mdash;piety&mdash;a
piety more womanly, more
profound, and more simple. She
said many striking things&mdash;things
that go straight to the heart: there
was perfect sympathy between her
soul and mine, but I watched over
myself that I might not betray the
admiration, the delight, the emotion,
with which I listened to her! In
the expression of her eyes, the tone
of her voice, and whole manner, I
could see, alas! how indifferent she
was towards me; that she regarded
me as her father’s agent&mdash;a mere employé,
worthy only of passing attention.”</p>

<p>“How do you know? You are
so accustomed to reading hearts
that perhaps you take imagination
for reality.”</p>

<p>“I do not think so.... She has
changed towards me, I acknowledge.
She regards me as a sincere, upright
person. I know how to keep in my
place, but there she allows me to
remain, and will continue to do so.”</p>

<p>Louis was extremely agitated
when he left us that evening. My
poor Victor, ill as he was, and he
was now worse than ever, was
thoughtful and sad for some time
after Louis had gone.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I am thinking of Louis,” he replied.
“I fear things may turn out
badly for our poor friend. I do not
know whether he will ever marry
Eugénie or not; but I have a presentiment,
I know not why, that this
love is to cause him great suffering.
And yet this attachment could not
fail to spring up. If it is God’s will
that Louis should pass through a severe
trial, promise me to stand by
him.”</p>

<p>“But you will also stand by
him?”</p>

<p>“I shall no longer be here.”</p>

<p>Sad words! they were soon to be
verified. Meanwhile, the hour of
trial was approaching our poor
friend&mdash;the trial he himself had foreseen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class="pc1">A SOUBRETTE’S PLOT.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, Fanny was preparing
sad hours for Louis.</p>

<p>Louis thought Eugénie maintained
great reserve during the conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
that took place on their way
home from church&mdash;so insatiable
is one who loves! But Fanny received
quite a different impression.
Never had she seen her mistress so
inspired, or converse with so much
fluency and animation. Mme. Smithson’s
kindness towards Louis, the
appreciatory remarks she and her
daughter made after their return
home, and the dry, haughty manner
with which Eugénie put Fanny in her
place when she attempted to speak of
the engineer, all excited the cunning
servant’s suspicions in the highest
degree.</p>

<p>“There is nothing lost yet,” she
said to herself; “perhaps there has
been no danger of it. Mademoiselle
is not in love with him now, but she
may be soon, if care is not taken.
To delay any further would risk
everything. I will hesitate no longer.
How M. Albert would reproach
me were I to warn him too late!
How much I should reproach myself!
Instead of having that excellent
boy, so dear to me, for a master
who would allow me to govern his
house in my own way, I should be
the humble servant of this gentleman,
who is by no means pleasing to
me, and who appears determined to
make everybody yield to him. He
is humble for the moment, because
he has nothing; but I can read in
his eyes: the day he is master here
it will be in earnest. I shall then
have to start. That would be distressing.
There is only one way of
avoiding such a misfortune: I must
hasten to write Albert’s mother!”</p>

<p>So saying, Fanny seated herself at
her table. An hour after, her <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>
was completed. She reminded
Mme. Frémin, her old mistress, of
the affection she had always cherished
for her and her son&mdash;which was true;
she spoke of having wished for
several years to see Albert marry
Eugénie, and pointed out the perfect
harmony of taste there was between
the two cousins. This point, however,
remained problematical. Fanny
added that she should not be
happy till the day she saw her two
dear children united and established,
and she herself living with
them, entirely devoted to their interests.</p>

<p>Like all shrewd people, the <i>soubrette</i>
reserved the most important
communication for the end of her
letter. She then remarked that Mlle.
Eugénie seemed to be tired of the
country, and it was time for Albert
to offer himself; for, if another suitor
appeared first, which she insinuated
was by no means improbable, Albert
might regret his delay. She had
serious apprehensions.... Albert
must really come. She would tell him
all; he would never regret having
undertaken the journey. But he
must be careful, if he came, not to
mention that she, Fanny, had urged
him to do so. If she wrote thus, it
was only because she was in a manner
constrained by her affection for
Albert and Eugénie. He must therefore
be careful not to risk everything
by his indiscretion....</p>

<p>This letter, carefully corrected
and copied, was taken to the post-office
in town the next day. No one
suspected Fanny had written to
Tante Frémin. It is useless to speak
of the impatience with which she
waited to see what her <i>protégé</i> would
do. She trembled at the idea that
he might not be roused till it was
entirely too late to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p class="pc1">A GLEAM BEFORE THE STORM.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">A week</span> after, Louis was again invited
to dine at Mr. Smithson’s,
whose birthday they were to celebrate.
The only people invited out
of the family were the doctor and the
<i>Curé</i> of St. M&mdash;&mdash;. The <i>curé’s</i> invitation
was an affair of importance, as
you will see.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson, as I have remarked,
was an Englishman by birth. He
had been induced by two motives to
settle permanently in France when
about thirty years of age: the climate
suited his constitution better
than that of his own country, and he
could live more at his ease on the
same income than he could in England.</p>

<p>Taking a house in Paris occupied
by several tenants, his attention was
drawn towards a young girl employed
in a mercer’s shop on the ground
floor of the same building. This
girl was no other than the present
Mme. Smithson. She lived with her
mother, who was in comfortable circumstances,
but made no pretensions.
They were very estimable
people, and gave the rich Englishman
to understand that he could only be
admitted as a visitor on condition
of acknowledged serious intentions.
Mr. Smithson at first hesitated. The
girl was not rich, she belonged to a
class he considered inferior to his
own, and, what was more, they were
of different religions. But it was too
late to call reason to his aid. For
six months he had felt a constantly
increasing love for her. He therefore
offered her his hand, merely
requiring one concession on her part
before he could marry her: she must
embrace the religion he professed
himself. Neither of the women who
listened to this proposition was pious,
but they did not lack faith, and they
fulfilled the absolute commands of
the church. They therefore replied,
without a moment’s hesitation, that
Mlle. Suzanne could not give up her
religion for the sake of marrying him.
At this, Mr. Smithson hesitated anew,
but, as before, love carried the day.
He renewed his offer, promising not
to interfere with Suzanne’s religious
belief if she would become his wife.
He only made one condition to their
marriage: they should respectively
practise their religion without making
any attempt to convert each other.
As to the children, the boys must be
brought up in their father’s belief,
the daughters in that of their mother.
Deplorable arrangement! showing
the shameful indifference of both
parties, or their foolish and culpable
inconsistency. You know the church
expressly forbids such concessions.
It only tolerates mixed marriages on
a precisely contrary condition: the
parties to be married must pledge
themselves that their offspring shall
be brought up in the Catholic religion.
I do not know how Mlle. Suzanne,
in becoming Mme. Smithson,
found means to evade this new difficulty.
It is possible that, through
ignorance or culpable weakness, she
yielded to the terms without acknowledging
it to any one. She doubtless
hoped, when the time came for testing
the arrangement, to find some
means of extricating herself from it.
At all events, they were married.
Mr. Smithson remained an Anglican,
and, astonishing to say, a thorough
one. His attachment to the Church
of England was easily explained by
those who knew him. He still cherished
an ardent love for his country,
and almost reproached himself for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
leaving it. His fidelity to the English
Church was a last testimony of
attachment to the country he had
abandoned.</p>

<p>When Eugénie was born, her father
manifested a temporary sullenness
and ill humor at her baptism
that frightened Mme. Smithson. Nevertheless,
she was firm. Eugénie
was brought up very strictly, and her
father gradually became accustomed
to her being a Catholic, to see her
practise her religion, and even hear
her speak of it with enthusiasm, for
she was enthusiastic on all great
themes.</p>

<p>These were, it must be said, the
only concessions Mr. Smithson made
to the true faith. He never entered
a Catholic church. He even refused
to acknowledge that which its very
enemies are forced to concede&mdash;the
grandeur and utility of the enterprises
she alone successfully achieves;
the efficacious assistance she renders
each one of us at critical moments
in our lives; and the happiness&mdash;earthly
happiness even&mdash;that she
bestows on all who are faithful to
her teachings. But the decided
stand Mr. Smithson took against the
true faith was specially manifested
by his antipathy to the priesthood.
Though he had lived a year and a
half at St. M&mdash;&mdash;, he had never had
any intercourse with the Abbé Bonjean,
the <i>curé</i> of the commune. Mme.
Smithson and her daughter went to
High Mass every Sunday, made the
<i>curé</i> a brief call on New Year’s Day,
and went to confession at Easter&mdash;that
was all. I had some reason,
therefore, to say it was a thing of no
small importance to see the <i>abbé</i> at
Mr. Smithson’s table. What had
effected such a change in the mind
of this dogmatic Englishman?...
Had his daughter begged it as a
favor?... By no means. Eugénie
was not pious enough to care
for the society of the <i>curé</i>....
Had Mme. Smithson ventured to
break the compact which forbade her
broaching, even remotely, the subject
of religion to her husband?
Still less likely. Madame had not
the courage unless forced to revolt
against some enormity like apostasy.
What led Mr. Smithson to invite the
<i>abbé</i> was the result of his own reflections.
Since he had taken charge
of a manufactory, and been brought
in contact with a large number of
workmen, some poor and others corrupt,
he had felt an increasing desire
of being useful to them, both morally
and physically. Mr. Smithson had
really a noble heart. Catholic benevolence
excited his admiration more
than he confessed. It caused him
to reflect, though he was careful
not to reveal his thoughts. These
salutary reflections had gradually
convinced him that, if he wished to
reform the place, he must obtain the
aid of some one not only of good-will
like Louis, but of incontestable
moral authority.... Where find
a person with more means than the
<i>curé</i>?... With the extreme
prudence habitual to him&mdash;and he
was more cautious now than ever, as it
was a question of a priest&mdash;he was
desirous of studying his future
co-laborer. He could not help it;
this black-robed man inspired him
with distrust. “I will begin by
studying him,” he said to himself;
“and, for that, he must come to my
house.” This plan decided upon, he
acted accordingly. Without telling
any one of his secret intention, without
even giving a hint of it, except to
his wife and daughter at the last moment,
he invited the <i>abbé</i>.</p>

<p>Louis had already begun to understand
his employer’s prejudices, and
was therefore extremely astonished
when he arrived to find the <i>curé</i> had
been invited. But his astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
was mingled with joy. He had already
become acquainted with the
<i>abbé</i>, and had been to confession
to him more than once, and had
more than one conversation with him.
The <i>curé</i> was even aware of all
Louis’ plans, and, as may be supposed,
gave them his entire approbation.</p>

<p>There was some stiffness and embarrassment
as the guests seated
themselves at table, and looked at
one another; but, after a few moments,
the genuine simplicity of the
<i>abbé</i>, who was no fool, and the doctor’s
facetiousness, broke the ice.
Mr. Smithson alone maintained his
usual reserve. He had sent for the
<i>abbé</i> that he might study his character,
and he was not neglecting it.
As to Louis, seated opposite Eugénie,
he seemed to emulate the wise
man of the Scriptures who had made
a compact with his eyes and his
tongue. He tempered the fire of his
eye, restrained his flow of words, and
courageously filled the part he had
imposed on himself&mdash;that of a man
serious unto coldness, calm unto insensibility.</p>

<p>Everything passed off very well till
the dessert. Mr. Smithson then directed
the conversation to the condition
of his workmen, and spoke of
his desire to ameliorate it. Eugénie
warmly applauded what her father
said; she spoke of some visits she had
made, and gave many interesting details
respecting the families she had
assisted.</p>

<p>The good <i>abbé</i> had, alas! one
fault. Priests have their faults as
well as we&mdash;fewer, without doubt,
but still they have some. The <i>curé’s</i>
defect was a want of prudence. He
was agreeable in conversation, and
had the best intentions in the world,
but he did not weigh his words sufficiently.
He never troubled himself
about the interpretation, malevolent
or otherwise, that certain people might
give to them. He was a good man,
but not sufficiently mindful of our Saviour’s
counsel to be wise as a serpent
and simple as a dove. He was amiable
and sincere, but lacking in discretion:
that was a misfortune. At
a time of religious indifference and of
impiety like ours, more than usual
prudence is necessary for all who love
their religion: the impious are so
glad to find a pretext for their calumnies!
The <i>abbé</i> now began in the
heartiest manner, and very sincerely
too, to compliment Mr. Smithson for
all he had said, and Mlle. Eugénie
for all she had done. He gave a
thrilling but true sketch of the ravages
want and immorality were making
among the working-classes, and
dwelt on the necessity of an immediate
and efficacious remedy. All this
was proper. There was nothing so
far to criticise. But the <i>abbé</i> should
have stopped there. He had, however,
the indiscretion to keep on,
adding many things ill adapted to
those before whom he was speaking.
“I know what remedies are necessary,”
said he; “and who of us does
not? They are&mdash;instruction to a
certain degree, visiting the poor in
their houses, dropping a good word,
and, above all, the infinite service of
leading them back to the holy Catholic
religion, which alone knows how
to influence the heart of man, and
inspire benevolent souls with the wisdom
and perseverance necessary for
perfecting their noble enterprises. I
hope I wound no one’s feelings in
expressing myself thus. What I have
said is only a well-known truth,
readily acknowledged by a multitude
of upright souls who have not, however,
the happiness of belonging to
us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson said nothing. He
felt the shaft, however blunted, that
was aimed so directly at him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
<i>curé</i> himself seemed conscious of having
gone too far in the ardor of his
untimely zeal. The Englishman was
one of those men who only retort
when obliged to: he remained silent.
The poor <i>curé</i> hurt himself still more
by enthusiastically eulogizing Louis a
few minutes after in these words:
“M. Louis, by another year, you will
have shown yourself the good angel
of the whole country around.”</p>

<p>This appeared exaggerated to Mr.
Smithson. It excited his jealousy,
already awakened. He imagined he
saw proofs of an understanding between
the <i>curé</i> and the engineer in
this unfortunate remark. Their understanding
had an evident aim, in
Mr. Smithson’s eyes, to diminish his
moral influence, and even suppress
it. “That is the way with Catholic
priests,” he said to himself. “They
are ambitious, scheming, eager to
rule, and knowing how to find accomplices
everywhere.” The <i>curé</i>
and Louis thenceforth became objects
of suspicion, though he was careful
not to show it outwardly.</p>

<p>Louis had begun to understand
human nature, and at once realized
all the imprudence of the <i>curé’s</i> remarks.
He foresaw the bad effect
they would have on the master of
the house. He tried in vain, by
some adroit turn in the conversation,
to lessen, if not to annul, the unfortunate
impression the <i>abbé’s</i> conversation
might have produced. The <i>curé</i>
persisted in his opinion, and only
added to his previous blunder. Louis
felt he should not gain anything, and
stopped short with so distressed an
air that it was pitiful to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson, led away by his
prejudices, thought Louis’ depression
the consequence of his accomplice’s
betraying so awkwardly the secret tie
between them. “The engineer is,
perhaps, the more dangerous of the
two,” he said to himself. “I should
never have suspected their plan, had
it not been for the <i>abbé’s</i> imprudent
frankness.” Hence he concluded
there would be more need than ever
of keeping an eye on his subordinate.</p>

<p>Eugénie, though not pious, understood
her religion too well, and loved
it, or rather, admired it too much,
to be astonished at what the <i>curé</i>
had said. She thoroughly agreed with
him, but, as the conversation became
serious, she only attended to the
most important points, and paid but
little attention to the <i>abbé’s</i> imprudent
remarks. The praise he bestowed
on Louis did not seem to her
excessive. She rather approved than
condemned it. She did not, therefore,
suspect the cause of Louis’
sadness, but attributed it to a want
of ease naturally occasioned by the
inferior position into which he had
been thrown by his misfortunes.
More than once she came to his aid,
politely addressing the conversation
to him. Seeing him still preoccupied,
she ended by proposing after
dinner that he should sing something
to her accompaniment. Louis excused
himself. “I insist upon it,”
she said, in a tone of sweet authority
that instantly transported him into
a new world. He forgot the <i>curé’s</i>
imprudence, its probable effect on
Mr. Smithson, and his own difficult
position. The first time for a long
while&mdash;ten years, perhaps&mdash;he had
one of those moments of cloudless
happiness that rarely falls to man’s
lot, and can never be forgotten. It
seemed as if a mysterious, ravishing
voice whispered that Eugénie was
beginning to love him. At least, he
no longer doubted for the moment
the possibility of her loving him
some day. Louis had the soul of
an artist, and possessed undoubted
talent, and he sang that evening as
he had never sung in his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>When the song was ended, he
turned toward Eugénie, and read in
her eyes sincere astonishment and
admiration, but nothing else. All
his doubts, all his sadness, revived.
An instant before, his heart overflowed
with joy: now he was so
cast down that he was alarmed, and
wondered what misfortune was going
to happen to him. I am not exaggerating:
ardent natures often pass
through such alternations of extreme
joy and sadness. The evening passed
away without any new incident.
Before midnight, the guests returned
home, and were free to yield to their
own thoughts. The few hours just
elapsed had modified the sentiments
of all who had dined together at
Mr. Smithson’s.</p>

<p>Eugénie, without allowing it to
appear outwardly, had also had one
of those sudden revelations that like
a flash reveal everything with unexpected
clearness. For the first time,
she fully realized the possibility of
loving one whom she at first despised.
Louis’ dignified, melancholy air,
his grave, earnest manner of conversing,
his remarkable musical talent,
and the sympathetic tone of his voice,
all produced an effect on Eugénie she
had never experienced before. Not
that she loved him yet, but she asked
herself how long her indifference
would last. First impressions are
hard to efface from ardent souls.
Eugénie was alarmed at the idea of
loving one who had at first inspired
her with so much distrust. She resolved
to watch more carefully over
herself, and keep an observant eye
on one who might take a place in
her heart she did not wish to give,
unless for ever.</p>

<p>This was wise. One cannot take
too much precaution when there is
reason to fear the heart is disposed
to yield. The heart is the best or
the worst of counsellors, according
as it is guided or abandoned by reason.
Besides, Eugénie was wholly
ignorant of Louis’ feelings towards
her.</p>

<p>Poor Louis ended the evening in
disheartening reflections. He began
by dwelling on a painful alternative:
either Eugénie did not suspect his
love for her, or, if she perceived it,
her only response was a coldness
that was discouraging. “And yet,”
thought he, “if I am mistaken!...
If she already loves me in her
heart!... If at least she could some
day love me!” ... He smiled. Then
another fear, still worse than the
rest, crossed his mind. “Well, if it
were so, there would be another obstacle
in the way more dangerous
than the indifference of Mlle. Eugénie
herself&mdash;the opposition of her
father. He would never consent to
the marriage. His antipathy to me
has always been evident. The <i>abbé</i>
has completed my ruin. I am
henceforth a dangerous man&mdash;a fanatic&mdash;in
Mr. Smithson’s eyes!”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” added Louis,
by way of conclusion. “Shall I
give up the work I have undertaken?
Ought I to practise my religion secretly,
in order to give no offence?...
No, indeed; that would be
cowardly, unworthy of a man of courage,
and criminal ingratitude towards
God, who has been so merciful to
me.... No hateful concessions!
With the divine assistance, I will do
what I think is for the best. Whatever
happens will be the will of
God.... Whatever it may be, I
shall be sure of having nothing to
repent of....”</p>

<p>To be serious, I should add that
Louis, in forming this resolution,
was not so heroic as he really
believed himself to be. He was
young, he was in love: and youth
and love have always some hope in
store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>It is useless to speak of Mr. Smithson.
We are aware of his sentiments.
Louis was not wrong in his fears
respecting him. And yet, however
sad Louis’ position might be, it was
soon to become still more so. A
new cloud was rising without his
suspecting it.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c463" name="c463">PHILOSOPHICAL TERMINOLOGY.</a></h2>

<p class="pc1 reduct">A LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF “THE CATHOLIC WORLD.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> suggestion often made in
your excellent magazine, that Americans
in general, and American Catholics
in particular, should be supplied
with some means of acquiring
sound knowledge of philosophical
truth, led me to consider what particular
plan might be most adapted
to this end, and what resources were
at our disposal for carrying out successfully
such a praiseworthy undertaking.
The result of this my investigation
is not calculated, perhaps,
to excite that degree of interest
which the subject deserves; yet, as
it may be the occasion of other useful
reflections on the part of those
who wish to promote this enterprise,
I have decided to offer it to your
philosophical readers.</p>

<p>I assume that our plan should unquestionably
embrace either all that
is worth knowing in philosophy, or
at least all that is needed for the explanation
and vindication of all important
truths, as well as for the radical
refutation of all modern errors.</p>

<p>To carry out such a plan, a writer
would need an extensive knowledge
and a keen appreciation of the teachings
of the scholastic philosophers
and theologians, and especially a
masterly comprehension of the general
principles on which those teachings
have their rational foundation.
Such a writer, I think I may safely
add, should be of that sort of men
who not only know the doctrines of
the great masters of the old school,
but who also feel the greatest respect
for those eminent thinkers; and he
should be prepared boldly to follow
their leadership in all fundamental
questions concerning principles, without
the least regard for what is now
circulated as “modern thought.”
His style should be modern, but his
principles should be the principles
sanctioned by the wisdom of all past
ages.</p>

<p>Every one, of course, will allow
that we modern men, in many
branches of natural science, have attained
to a degree of information
vastly superior to what the ancients
even dreamed of. Accordingly, we
may not improperly consider ourselves
better qualified than they were
for the solution of a great number
of physical questions, of which they
are known to have either overlooked
the very existence, or missed the true
interpretation. It is quite certain,
however, at the same time, that we
are immensely inferior to them with
regard to strictly philosophical knowledge;
and this is the more surprising
as one would suppose that our
superior information concerning the
laws of nature would have enabled
us to reach truth from a higher
standpoint, and to correct and improve,
even to perfection, the philosophical
theories of the old school.
Yet the fact is certain and notorious:
we have only a few good philosophers,
while we need a great many
to stand against the torrent of infidelity.</p>

<p>As it is, I think that no man of
judgment will deny that we cannot
raise ourselves to a competent philosophical
level and secure the triumph
of truth unless we learn again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
turn to account in our war against
our modern barbarians, those doctrines
that triumphed over the barbarians
of old, and made Europe
remain for centuries the shining centre
of the civilized world. Wisdom
was not born yesterday, and philosophical
principles are as old as
mankind; hence, new facts may be
seen, but no new principles of philosophy
can be invented.</p>

<p>It therefore remains for us, if we
wish to spread sound knowledge and
foster true wisdom, to cling to the
old philosophical principles, to vindicate
them so far as in our present
struggling condition it may be necessary,
and to apply them judiciously
to the close discussion and consistent
settlement of arising questions. This
is the road that will lead us to the
goal; and it is a short and easy one,
too; for the first principles of all
things are not very many, and can
be mastered with ease, while their
application needs only two conditions,
namely, first, a sufficient knowledge
of the primitive facts and laws
of the physical order; and, second, a
rigorous logic.</p>

<p>As the main object we should
have in view is the improvement of
American thought concerning moral
and social truths, it might seem that
the work of which I am speaking
should mainly be a work of moral
philosophy, comprising the treatment
of all natural rights and natural
duties whether of individuals or of
societies, and leaving dialectics and
metaphysics mostly in the background
as idle speculations, or at
least as teaching nothing that is essential
to the happiness and prosperity
of private and public life. It is a
fact that the general reader is inclined
to look upon all logical and metaphysical
subtleties as a string of mere
quibbles or an array of unsubstantialities.
Though I am sure that, in the
present wretched state of our public
education, many would be found,
even among our best citizens, ready
to adopt and countenance such a
view of the subject, I must say that
the view is intrinsically wrong.</p>

<p>Philosophy is a whole whose parts
are not merely <i>integrant</i>, but <i>constituent</i>;
for each of these parts is essentially
linked with the others. As
time cannot exist without motion, so
neither can moral philosophy without
logic and metaphysics; and so
sure as no velocity can exist apart
from a moving body, even so rational
philosophy cannot exist apart from
all metaphysical truth. To see this
the more clearly, let us examine what
are the relations that bind together
the parts of philosophy.</p>

<p>The old division of this science into
<i>rational</i>, <i>real</i>, and <i>moral</i>, which we
find to have been given by Plato,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
is drawn from the inmost nature of
things and the very constitution of philosophy.
Everything that is perfect,
whether it has an existence in the
fields of reality, or only in the region
of thought, is found to involve in
its constitution, 1, something competent
to give a certain determination;
2, some other thing liable to receive
such a determination; 3, some third
thing which is the immediate result
of the concurrence of the other two.
That which gives a determination
is called the “formal” constituent
of the thing; that which receives
such a determination is called the
“material” constituent of the same
thing; finally, that which results is
called the “formal complement,” and
is the actual constitution or the very
actuality of the thing thus constituted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
Thus, for example, the human soul,
inasmuch as it gives life to the human
body, is the formal constituent
of man; the organic body, inasmuch
as it receives life through the soul,
is his material constituent; and
actual conscious life, which is the
immediate result of the concurrence
of soul and body in one compound
nature, is the actuality of the being
thus constituted, and makes it formally
complete in its individual
reality.</p>

<p>Now, philosophy is similarly made
up of three such constituents. The
formal constituent and, as it were,
the soul of philosophy (and of all
other sciences, too) is logic, or <i>rational
philosophy</i>. Its duty is to
impress a kind of rational stamp on
the objects of science by applying
to them the process of definition, division,
and argumentation, which
is the scientific process, and constitutes
the “form” of science. For
this reason, logic holds that place in
regard to any object of science
which the soul holds in regard to its
body, and is therefore to be considered
as the formal constituent of
philosophy.</p>

<p>The material part, or the body, of
philosophy is “all real being as
such,” or, in other terms, all the
subject-matter of metaphysics, or
<i>real philosophy</i>; for metaphysics is
nothing but the knowledge of real
things acquired through the consideration
of their intrinsic constitution;
hence, all reality, be it created or uncreated,
matter or spirit, substance
or accident, is the “material” constituent
of philosophy inasmuch as it
is subjected to the scientific form by
the application made to it of the
logical process. The objective truth
of things, so long as it is not subjected
to the searching scrutiny of
speculative reasoning, mostly belongs
to the lower region of experimentalism,
which scarcely deserves, though
it has usurped, the high name of
science; but, when pervaded by intellectual
light, rises suddenly as
vivified by it, and takes up its place
in the serene region of metaphysics,
where it shows itself in all the glory
of its ontological beauty. Hence it
is that metaphysics may be compared
to a living body, of which logic
is the soul.</p>

<p>Finally, by the application of logic
to objective realities, namely, by the
study of metaphysics, a wonderful
bond is established between the rational
faculty and objective truth, the first
getting hold of the second, and the
second reacting after its own manner
on the first; so that reason, enlightened
by objective truth, knows how to
pronounce a right judgment on the
merit of things, and in its natural
rectitude feels compelled to give them
that relative place in its estimation
to which each of them is reasonably entitled.
As the soul, therefore,
owing to its intimate connection with
the body, “feels” what suits or suits,
not the requirement of the animated
organism, and is pleased with the
one, and displeased with the other, so also
reason, owing to its clear possession
of objective truth, “perceives”
what agrees and what clashes with:
the objective order of things, and,
with the authority of a judge, pronounces
its sentence that the first
must be approved, and the second
condemned. Such dictates of reason
form the object of <i>moral philosophy</i>;
and it is through them that the moral
law is naturally communicated and
promulgated to all rational creatures.</p>

<p>Hence, it is evident that the knowledge
of morality is the result of an
intellectual knowledge of the real
nature of things, and of their intrinsic
perfection, exigencies, and manifold
relations. Hence, also, the conclusion
that the rational, the real, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
the moral order, though distinct objects
of knowledge, are so bound
together in one general science
that it would be scarcely possible to
speak of the one without referring to
the other. Hence, finally, the further
conclusion that the greater the importance
of a true and thorough
knowledge of morality, the more stringent
is the necessity of securing to it
the foundation of good, sound, and
intelligible metaphysics. To neglect
the latter would be to tamper with
the most vital interests of the former.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might go even further,
and say that what we need just now
is not so much a new book of logic
or of ethics as of metaphysics. A
good metaphysical work is the surest
foundation both of a good logic and
of a good moral philosophy. The
laws of thought and the laws of morality
must be explained in accordance
with the laws of real being;
and the better we understand these
last, the more truly conversant shall
we become with the first. Besides,
with respect to logic and ethics, we
have no new doctrines to teach,
whilst in metaphysics we have to
settle a number of old and new questions
regarding the constitution of
natural things, and their causality,
and their mutual connection, as we
find that such questions are not satisfactorily
treated either by the ancient
metaphysicians or by our modern
unphilosophical physicists. Such
questions regard, as I said, natural
things; but their solution has a bearing
on many other philosophical
doctrines, because it materially effects
the terminology by which those doctrines
are to be expounded.</p>

<p>I do not wish, nor would this be
the place, to enter into particulars
with regard to the method which
might be followed in the treatment
of different philosophical subjects;
yet I think it worth remarking in
general that the fewer the principles
on which a philosopher shall build
his reasonings, the more clear, uniform,
and satisfactory will his demonstrations
generally prove; and, on the
other hand, in proportion as these
principles shall be higher, the fewer
will be needed. This leads me to
believe that one of the best means
which could be made available for
the much-desired success of the undertaking
would be to take our standpoint
as high as possible (according
to the very nature of philosophy,
which is <i>scientia per summas causas</i>),
and to base our demonstrations on
the very first constituent principles
of being. Looking down from such
a height, we could easily dissipate
the vague phantasmagory, and control
the dangerous influences of many
other so-called principles or axioms
whose intrusion into the body of
philosophy is due to ignorance or
wrong interpretation of the facts
and laws of the physical world.
It is through these assumed principles
that a very lamentable discord
has been fostered and perpetuated
between the votaries of physics, on
the one hand, and those of metaphysics,
on the other; and it is through
the same cause, that even now the
same student, after learning one thing
as true in his class of metaphysics,
is obliged to hear it declared false
in his class of natural philosophy.
This should not be; and we may
hope that it will not be when our
philosophical reasonings are ultimately
grounded on first principles, and
when no secondary principles are
admitted which are not demonstrated,
or corrected, or restricted by
some evident and adequate reduction
to first principles.</p>

<p>But now a question is to be answered
which professors of philosophy
will perhaps be the first to propose.
The question is this: Can a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
sound and thorough work of philosophy,
such as we want, be written in
common and popular English, so as
to prove easy reading for the average
American student? Or must a special
language be used which none but
trained philosophers will understand?</p>

<p>Every one who knows how peculiar
is the language of other sciences
and arts will anticipate the answer.
Of course, the English tongue is as
fit as any other to express common
thoughts; but common thoughts are
the thoughts of common people, who
do not commonly think with the
utmost philosophical precision, nor
talk of matters (of which there are
many in philosophy) that transcend
the common wants of their ordinary
avocations. This being the case, it
is obvious that, in writing a philosophical
work (especially if it be intended
to serve as a text-book for our
higher Catholic institutions), it will
be necessary to make use of a special
language, which, though English,
cannot be that easy-going and popular
English which we find in common
use, but must be a precise,
guarded, dry, methodic, abstract,
and perhaps stiff language, such as
the gravity, subtlety, and difficulty
of philosophical investigations often
require.</p>

<p>I said, “Especially if the work
is intended to serve as a text-book,”
because, in this case, it will be absolutely
necessary to adopt in it the
whole of the philosophical terminology
that has been handed down to
us by our Catholic ancestors. Terminology,
in all branches of study,
is the faithful exponent of the various
achievements of science, and
contains, as it were, a summary of
all that mankind has succeeded in
learning in the course of centuries.
To ignore more or less the philosophic
terminology is therefore to ignore
more or less the wisdom of all
past ages. Moreover, it is only by
means of an exact terminology that
a teacher can convey the knowledge
of exact truth to his pupils’ minds;
and accordingly, all who study philosophy
<i>ex professo</i> need to be well acquainted
with its language, that they
may acquire a clear, distinct, and
precise knowledge of things; so that,
when called upon in after-life to discuss
or expound philosophical matters
in a plain and popular way for
the benefit of the unlearned, they
may use such circumlocutions as will
not essentially conflict with the truth
of things. Experience shows that
those who have not a clear and distinct
conception of things, however
much they may try to explain themselves,
are never well understood.</p>

<p>But what if our work be not especially
intended for the class-room,
but only for common reading?
Would it still be difficult to have it
written in a plain and intelligible
manner? I think it would, unless,
indeed, we leave out the most fundamental
questions of metaphysics. If
we were asked only to write a few
“academical” essays on philosophical
subjects, without concerning ourselves
with the intimate nature of
things, it would not be very difficult
to perform such a task in tolerably
readable and popular English; but
if we are asked to go to the root
of things, and to give a consistent,
clear, accurate, and radical account
of them and of their objective relations;
if we are expected to lay down
and explain those grounds of distinction
between similar things that will
enable us to avoid latent equivocations,
to detect paralogistic inferences,
and to expose the sophistry
of our opponents; if, in short, we
must prepare a standard work
which will create a deep and lasting
interest, and take hold of the
public mind by its fitness to uproot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
prejudice, to confound error, and to
silence, if possible, all philosophical
knavery, then, I say, we cannot do
this in the language with which people
are generally familiar, without
filling it with a number of other
words, phrases, and formulas of our
own. This, however, should not be
looked upon as discouraging; for
the popularity to which a work on
philosophy aspires is not the general
popularity of the newspaper or
the novel, but a popularity confined
within the range of deep-thinking
minds. Philosophy is not intended
for blockheads nor for the general
reader; hence, if these have no relish
for our philosophical style, we shall
not, on that account, complain of
any want of popularity.</p>

<p>We must own, however, that a
number of philosophical words have
become popular in other modern
languages which are still above popular
comprehension in the English;
and on this account the range of
popularity of a philosophical work
will be less in our country than it
would, all other things being equal, in
France, Italy, or Spain. In these
last countries, where languages are
so nearly akin to the philosophic Latin,
and where the study of philosophy
under the supervision of the
Catholic Church formed for centuries
a prominent part of public education,
every educated person soon
learned how to express in his national
idiom what he had been taught in
the Latin of the schools. It is
through this process that the language
of philosophy gradually became,
in those countries, the language
of all educated people. In
England, the same process was going
on up to the XVIth century, and, if
continued, would have led to the
same results; but it was checked at
the time of the Reformation, to the
unphilosophical and maleficent genius
of which it must therefore be
ascribed that all further popular development
of the philosophic language
has been arrested for three
centuries in the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

<p>Had England remained Catholic,
and continued, like her sister nations,
to cultivate the fields of speculative
knowledge, there is little doubt that
English writers, and the clergy in
particular, would have popularized
and brought into common use those
philosophical and theological expressions
which had been received already
in their dictionaries, and might
have been a most valuable instrument
for improving the intellectual
education of the country. But
while this process of familiarizing
speculative knowledge was carried on
throughout Catholic Europe, England
had something else more pressing to
do: she busied herself with tearing
to pieces and burning the metaphysical
and theological books she had
inherited from the great Catholic
founders and luminaries of her universities.
How could the Anglo-Saxon
race attain to even a common
degree of philosophic development
under the sway of a system which
was the very negation of philosophy?
Could any one be a philosopher, and
yet “protest” against conclusions
of which he had to concede the premises?
Protestantism was not the
offspring of reason, but of passion
and tyranny; it is carnal, not intellectual;
it popularizes matter, and
studies material comfort, but cannot
raise the people to the contemplation
and appreciation of eternal and universal
truth. Hence, whilst in all the
branches of knowledge which are
connected with their senses the English
people made remarkable strides,
in philosophy they remained infants;
and it was only by rowing the boat
against the stream that a few privileged
beings saved some relics from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
the great national wreck. Even now
the Anglo-Saxon Protestant is fated
to admire Hume and Bain, Darwin
and Huxley, Mill and Herbert Spencer;
and it will be long before he
realizes that it is a shame to talk of
these sophists as “our great national
philosophers.”</p>

<p>The same evil that stayed in England
the process of popularization
of the philosophical language, caused
this language to remain deficient in
many useful and some necessary
words wherewith other nations wisely
enriched their vernacular tongues.
This is equivalent to saying that
the English idiom, even as used by
the learned, does not always afford
sufficient facilities for the exact expression
of metaphysical relations,
and that, therefore, a writer who
wishes to be quite correct in treating
of them will be tempted to take
liberties with the language, and will
yield to the temptation.</p>

<p>As an example of this, suppose we
wish to say in plain English what S.
Thomas Aquinas teaches in the following
sentence (in 1. <i>Sentent</i>. Dist.
2. q. 1, a. 2): “In Deo est sapientia,
et bonitas, et hujusmodi, quorum
quodlibet est ipsa divina essentia; et
ita omnia sunt unum. Et quia unumquodque
eorum est in Deo secundum
sui verissimam rationem, et
ratio sapientiæ non est ratio bonitatis
in quantum hujusmodi, relinquitur
quod sunt diversa ratione non tantum
ex parte ipsius ratiocinantis, sed
ex proprietate ipsius rei.”</p>

<p>How should we here translate the
word ratio? Andrews’ <i>Dictionary</i>
gives <i>reason</i>, <i>account</i>, <i>business</i>, <i>relation</i>,
<i>regard</i>, <i>concern</i>, <i>care</i>, <i>manner</i>, <i>plan</i>,
<i>reasonableness</i>, <i>proof</i>, and such like;
to which we may add the very word
“ratio” used by the English geometricians
to express the quotient of a
quantity divided by another of the
same kind. Now, which of these
terms can we employ in the present
case? There is not one of them
which would not transform this beautiful
and important passage of the
angelic doctor into a clumsy piece
of nonsense. To speak of the <i>reason</i>
of wisdom, of the <i>concern</i> of goodness,
of the <i>manner</i> of eternity, or of the
<i>business</i> of immensity would be absurd.
The temptation to infringe on
the rights of lexicographers is therefore
evident. But what other English
word can we employ? Should
we translate, <i>the concept</i> of wisdom,
and <i>the concept</i> of goodness? By no
means. Not that this last meaning
of the word <i>ratio</i> is not legitimate,
but because it is not what we need
in the present case; for the holy
doctor does not say that God’s wisdom
and goodness are distinct only
on account of our conceptions, but
explicitly teaches that they are distinct
on their own grounds, “ex proprietate
ipsius rei.” Hence, “concept”
is not the right word; and, instead
of “concept,” we should rather say
“that which is the ground of the
concept.” Yet this circumlocution,
besides being too long to replace a
single word, does not exactly correspond
to it, as every intelligent reader
will easily perceive. The force of
the word <i>ratio</i> might be sufficiently
rendered by the compound expression
“objective notion”; but this is
forbidden by our dictionaries, according
to which the word “notion” has
only a subjective sense. We cannot
translate “the nature” of wisdom
and “the nature” of goodness, because
it would then seem that divine
wisdom and divine goodness are of
a different nature objectively, and
therefore <i>really</i> distinct; which is
not the case, as they are only <i>mentally</i>
distinct, though on their own
<i>real</i> grounds. Perhaps, to avoid
misconceptions, we might add an
epithet to the word “nature,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
translate <i>ratio sapientiæ</i> as “the notional
nature of wisdom,” that is, as
that formality which is distinctly represented
by the notion of wisdom.
This last expression might be considered
tolerably correct; yet I should
prefer to stick to the Latin <i>ratio</i>,
which is so much simpler and clearer,
and which has, moreover, a general
and uniform application to all objects
of thought; as we everywhere find
<i>ratio intelligibilis</i>, <i>ratio entitativa</i>, <i>ratio
generica</i>, <i>ratio specifica</i>, <i>ratio personæ</i>,
<i>ratio substantiæ</i>, and a great number
of similar ratios. And, again, the
word <i>ratio</i> has another very superior
claim to adoption, inasmuch as it is
the only word that exactly expresses
the transcendental unity resulting
from the conspiration of a material
with a formal principle, and implies
in its concrete meaning the two
principles from which it results as
actually correlated; for, as the
geometric ratio implies a numerator
and a denominator correlated as
“that which is mensurable” and
“that by which it is measured,” so
the <i>ratio intelligibilis</i>, the <i>ratio entitativa</i>, and
all the others, imply and
exhibit a potential and a formal
principle, correlated as “that which
is determinable” and “that by
which it is determined”; and as
the terms of a geometric ratio, inasmuch
as they are correlated, give
rise to a simple result which
is the value of the ratio, so also
the constituent principles of all beings,
inasmuch as they are correlated
according to their mutual ontological
exigency, give rise to the actuality
of the ontological <i>ratio</i>. It would
therefore appear that, if mathematicians
are allowed freely to use the
word “ratio,” as they do, in the
peculiar sense just stated, metaphysicians
too, <i>a fortiori</i>, may be allowed
the free use of the same word in that
general sense which I have pointed
out, and which, solely through English
philosophical apathy, was unduly
restricted to its present narrow mathematical
meaning.</p>

<p>What I have said of this word may
suffice as an instance of the poverty
of our philosophical language. There
are other words which philosophers
are sometimes disappointed not to
find in our dictionaries, and which it
will be necessary to borrow from
other sources, or to translate from
the works of the schoolmen; but, as
I cannot come to particulars without
entering into discussions which would
lead me much further than I at
present intend to go, I will say nothing
more on this point.</p>

<p>I beg to conclude with a last remark
which some readers may deem
superfluous, but which should not be
overlooked by the teachers or the
friends of philosophy. It is not so
much the want of proper words as
the vague and improper use of the
words which we already possess that
is calculated to impair the merit and
mar the usefulness of an English
work of philosophy. If I knew that
any one was engaged in such a work,
I would earnestly entreat him to spare
no efforts to the end that all indefiniteness
or looseness of expression
may be excluded from it, and to take
care that his philosophic language be,
if possible, as precise and as carefully
wielded as that of the mathematician.
In philosophy, nothing is so
dangerous as loose reasoning; and
loose reasoning is inevitable with a
loose terminology. Truth, by careless
wording, is often changed into
error, and even great heresies are
frequently nothing but the incorrect
expression of great truths; according
to the remarkable sentence of S.
Thomas: <i>Ex verbo inordinate prolato
nascitur hæresis.</i> Hence, all those
terms which in the popular language
have a vague meaning should in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
philosophy be either avoided or
strictly defined, and constantly taken
in the strict sense of the definition.</p>

<p>I remember having found years
ago, in the works of an Italian philosopher
whose celebrity has since
vanished, nine or ten <i>different</i> definitions
of the word <i>idea</i>. Which of
such definitions he adopted as his
own I could not discover; but it
seemed to me that he adopted them
all in succession, according as they
suited the actual needs of his multiform
argumentation&mdash;a proceeding
which, while confounding the minds
of his readers, was certainly not calculated
to give weight to his conclusions.
This same word <i>idea</i> in our
popular English is extremely indefinite;
it stands for <i>object of thought</i>,
<i>plan</i>, <i>judgment</i>, <i>opinion</i>, <i>purpose</i>, and
<i>intention</i>, none of which would be the
correct philosophical meaning of the
word; for “idea,” in all the approved
treatises of psychology, means the
knowledge of a thing directly perceived
in any object of first apprehension.
Hence, no accurate philosopher
would say that we have an “idea”
of God, or of his immensity, or of
virtue, but only that we have a “concept”
of God, of his immensity, of
virtue, and of all those other things
that are not objects of first apprehension,
and the notions of which can be
acquired only by a special operation
of the intellect on pre-existing ideas.
This distinction between “idea” and
“concept” is very important in
psychology, and should therefore be
adopted in a philosophical work at
the very first beginning of logic, as
a first precaution against the equivocations
of the ontologists.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to point out
other words the popular meaning of
which must be sharply looked into by
a philosopher before he makes use
of them; I will only add, in connection
with the word “idea,” that, in
the classical books of philosophy, the
direct knowledge of the existence of
a thing was not called “idea,” but
<i>notitia</i>. In English, we have the word
“notice”; but this word means, according
to Webster, <i>the act</i> by which
we have knowledge of something within
the reach of our senses, whilst the
Latin word <i>notitia</i> means rather the
permanent <i>knowledge</i> acquired by
that act; whence we see that the
Latin <i>notitia facti</i> cannot be translated
“the notice of the fact,” and yet
why should not a philosopher be
allowed to use the word “notice” in
the sense of the Latin <i>notitia</i> when
he wishes to contrast the knowledge
of the existence of a thing with the
knowledge of its properties? This
would be, after all, only a late justice
done to the word by again recognizing
its primitive legitimate meaning.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the word <i>conscientia</i>,
which in Latin has two distinct
meanings, the psychological and
the moral, in English has been represented
by two distinct words, “consciousness”
and “conscience.” This
is a real improvement, so far as it
goes. But the word “consciousness,”
which properly expresses the
knowledge of self and of the affections
of self, has already acquired, as
used by modern authors, a very indefinite
meaning, inasmuch as it
already replaces not only the Latin
<i>conscientia</i>, but every kind of knowledge
as well; so that our educated
men do not scruple to declare their
consciousness of the rotation of the
earth, or their consciousness of your
presence in the room. In philosophy,
where no word should be liable
to two interpretations, such a promiscuous
and illogical use of the
word is really intolerable; and I respectfully
submit that the word
should by all means be again restricted
to its natural signification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>Not to tire the reader with other
considerations of a similar nature, I
will come to an end. My object has
been to point out in a general manner
what I considered to be most
needed in a good English philosophical
work. Certainly, a work
based on unobjectionable principles,
ample in its scope, complete in its
parts, and precise in its terminology,
would be a great boon to the higher
classes of American society. Let a
writer come forward who, besides a
sound knowledge of philosophical
truths, possesses the rare art of expressing
them correctly and forcibly
in plain language, and he will see
his efforts so fully rewarded that he
will never regret the labor he may
have endured in such a difficult
undertaking.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="pc1 reduct">JESUIT AND NEW PROTESTANT.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Early</span> the next morning, the count
was awakened suddenly from his
slumber. The three bells of the church-tower
gave forth sorrowful tones.
The peasants assembled from all
parts. Von Scharfenstein opened a
window, and looked in vain for the
rising smoke, in order to discover
the whereabouts of the fire; but
neither flame nor smoke was to
be seen. And yet all the inhabitants,
men, women, and children, were
moving in the same direction, so that
there must have been some cause
for the alarm.</p>

<p>“Where is the fire?” he asked of
an aged man, who could hardly
walk even with the aid of his cane.
“Where is the fire, good man?”</p>

<p>“There is no fire; the gendarmes
are here to arrest our pastor.”</p>

<p>Von Scharfenstein closed the window.</p>

<p>“This is too much,” said he angrily.
“The Freemasons, who are ordinarily
cunning enough, have this time
committed a great mistake. If the
sons of the cross are not more prudent
than the sons of the trowel,
there will be bloodshed in this case.
The peasants will defend their priest
with scythes and axes.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the police commissioner
who had come from the city with
two gendarmes endeavored to put
a stop to the ringing of the bells.
Before going to the church, he had
foolishly stationed the gendarmes upon
the high step of the pastoral residence,
so that the Jesuit should not escape.</p>

<p>“Stop the ringing of the bells,”
cried out the commissioner to the
bell-ringers.</p>

<p>“Ring away!” exclaimed a sturdy,
well-dressed farmer who had closely
followed the commissioner. “Continue
to ring; the bells are ours; there is fire!”</p>

<p>“I am the police commissioner,”
said the officer sternly. “I am here
by the command of the government,
and I repeat my orders to stop at
once the ringing of the bells!”</p>

<p>“And I am the burgomaster of
this place, and repeat that the bells
shall be rung,” replied the angry and
excited villager. “You have no
right to command here, and much
less in the church. When the whole
parish is assembled, the bells shall
be stopped, not before.”</p>

<p>The commissioner ground his
teeth. He quailed before the determined
aspect of the burgomaster,
and returned to the priest’s house.
There his anger changed into fear.
The large yard before the house,
the surrounding walls, and the street
were thickly covered with people.
He saw threatening looks and fierce
eyes glaring upon him when he ascended
the steps. The crowd was
as yet quiet, but already there were
signs of a coming storm.</p>

<p>The police commissioner unceremoniously
entered the presence of
Prince Joseph von Eberstein, the
Jesuit father.</p>

<p>“There, look!” he exclaimed rudely.
“That is your work&mdash;open rebellion
against the government!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pardon me, Herr Commissioner,”
replied the priest calmly; “how
could I have caused the tumult,
since I had no knowledge of your
coming?”</p>

<p>“You have nevertheless incited
the people to revolt against the
government, and here is the result
of your teaching!”</p>

<p>“Sir, I have not incited the people
against the government; the government
itself, by a violent and
unjustifiable act, has provoked the
honest wrath of these simple peasants.
I beg you to be less prejudiced.”</p>

<p>The bells were now silent; in the
yard, a threatening murmur was
heard; the crowd seemed to be
greatly incensed, and the commissioner
saw that the situation was
becoming very critical. He listened
at the window.</p>

<p>“To carry away our priest like a
thief, like a murderer!” exclaimed a
trembling voice. “We will not permit
it; he must remain here!”</p>

<p>“If our pastor was a servant of
Judas,” said another voice, “and
would betray our religion to the
Freemasons, then they would not
persecute him. But because he is
a pious, conscientious priest whom
we all love and respect, they wish to
take him away.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is the reason.”</p>

<p>“We will not suffer it; we will
keep our priest; he shall not go!”
exclaimed many voices confusedly.</p>

<p>The officer looked at the excited
crowd, and acknowledged that it
would be dangerous to use violence.</p>

<p>“I regret this commotion,” said
Prince von Eberstein. “If, however,
you choose to follow my advice, you
can yet take your prisoner.”</p>

<p>“What is your advice?”</p>

<p>“Send away the gendarmes at
once; their presence only serves to
exasperate the people. After that,
I will speak to my parishioners,
and will enter the carriage with
you.”</p>

<p>“Your advice is discreet,” replied
the commissioner, who went out,
and commanded the gendarmes to
leave Weselheim forthwith.</p>

<p>The departure of the gendarmes
tranquillized the crowd. The threats
ceased, and the clinched fists were
opened. Upon the steps of his residence
the prince now appeared
dressed in his cassock.</p>

<p>“May Jesus Christ be praised,
your reverence!” exclaimed the assembled
parish.</p>

<p>“Now and for ever, dear children!
First let me thank you for the love
and sympathy you have always
shown me during my stay among
you. You know that the government
objects to my remaining here because
I am a foreigner. I have been
frequently directed by the temporal
power to leave my parish. But because
our Lord Jesus Christ has not
commanded the temporal powers to
preach the Gospel, to administer the
sacraments, or to govern the church,
but has given that right to the Pope,
the bishops, and the priests, and because
I have derived my mission not
from the temporal authority, but from
the church, I have refused to leave
the dear fold entrusted to my care,
nor shall I leave it. In order that
these unfortunate disturbances may
not recur again, I intend to accompany
the commissioner to the city.
There I will lay the whole affair before
our most gracious king, who is a
wise and just ruler. I shall ask him
to arrange matters so that I shall
not be molested again in the discharge
of my sacred duties. Are
you satisfied, dear parishioners?”</p>

<p>The deepest silence reigned.</p>

<p>“Your reverence,” exclaimed a
voice, “if you promise us to come
back, then we are satisfied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>“I promise it to you,” answered
the priest firmly.</p>

<p>He then re-entered the house.</p>

<p>“Herr Commissioner, have the
carriage immediately brought before
the steps, so that any further excitement
may be avoided.”</p>

<p>This was done. When, however,
the children saw their pastor getting
into the carriage, they commenced
to weep aloud, in which the girls and
women joined, so that heart-rending
lamentations filled the air. The
driver whipped the horses, and the
carriage almost flew through the now
desolated village.</p>

<p>“Do not weep so!” said Keller;
“our pastor will return: he has promised
it.”</p>

<p>“But if they imprison him?” said
a timid woman.</p>

<p>“Ah! bah! things have not yet
come to such a pass!” observed the
burgomaster; “the parish will protect
him!”</p>

<p>The people now separated. Only
the burgomaster and some of the
influential villagers remained in the
priest’s house conversing together.
In a short time, another carriage
stopped at the door. The astonished
men saw an official wearing a very
rich uniform descend from the carriage.</p>

<p>“I think I know him,” said Keller.
“Yes; I am right: he is one of
the four Freemasons.”</p>

<p>A priest who accompanied the
official was received by the villagers
with sharp and suspicious looks.</p>

<p>“Good-morning!” said the friendly
official. “I am rejoiced to meet
here in the priest’s house such a number
of gentlemen. Herr Burgomaster,
if I am not mistaken?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am he, and these are the
councilmen.”</p>

<p>“This is splendid; what a fortunate
circumstance!” remarked the official.
“I am the government counsellor,
and have come to introduce this reverend
gentlemen into his office, so that
the good parish of Weselheim should
not be one moment without a pastor.”</p>

<p>The men looked at one another;
they were greatly perplexed, and
seemed hardly to understand what
was going on.</p>

<p>“But, Herr Counsellor,” said the
burgomaster, “we have a pastor.
He went only an hour ago to the city
to see his most gracious majesty the
king, and to-morrow he will return.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Herr Burgomaster,”
assured the smiling counsellor
and grandmaster of the Freemasons.
“The Jesuit will not return.”</p>

<p>The last words fell like a thunderbolt
among them.</p>

<p>“What?&mdash;O ho!” exclaimed the
men. “We shall see! Our pastor is
the Rev. Herr von Eberstein; we
wish no other.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, Herr von Eberstein
is a foreigner,” replied the
counsellor, shrugging his shoulders.
“I introduce to you a pious priest
whose zeal will certainly bring a blessing
upon the parish.”</p>

<p>The priest bowed and smiled, but
the villagers evidently did not like
him.</p>

<p>“What is your name, if we may be
allowed to ask?”</p>

<p>“My name is Stechapfel” (thorn-apple),
answered the priest.</p>

<p>“What! Stechapfel?” cried they
all, drawing back.</p>

<p>“Are you not the New Protestant
Stechapfel of whom we have read so
much in the newspapers?” inquired
Ewald, one of the councilmen.</p>

<p>“I am not a New Protestant, but
an Old Catholic,” replied Stechapfel.</p>

<p>“It is really so&mdash;it is he!” exclaimed
Keller. “Do you know, Herr
Stechapfel, what you call ‘Old Catholic’
is understood among Catholics
as ‘New Protestant’? We know also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
why the heretics of our day have invented
the word ‘Old Catholic’:
they did so to throw sand in the eyes
of the people; as if they, the heretics,
had remained faithful to the old
Catholic doctrine, but the Pope and
all the bishops and priests, as also all
Catholics, had renounced the true
faith. Luther, the first Protestant,
did the very same thing. He accused
the Pope and the bishops of having
left the old doctrine, but that he,
Luther, had retained it, for which
reason he was an Old Catholic. The
same is repeated to-day; it is deception&mdash;pure
deception; therefore we
do not call these deceivers ‘Old
Catholics,’ but ‘New Protestants.’”</p>

<p>“I deplore all this confusion,” replied
Stechapfel devoutly. “I have
nothing to do with Luther nor with
heresy of any sort. I keep firmly to
the Old Catholic doctrine.”</p>

<p>“Please listen to me, Herr Stechapfel;
I wish to ask you something,”
began Keller, moving his cap on
one side of his head. “Do you believe
that the Pope is infallible
when he explains and defines how
an article of faith or of morals is to
be understood?”</p>

<p>“No; I do not believe it, because
it was never believed before,” replied
Stechapfel.</p>

<p>“Was never believed before&mdash;only
hear that!” exclaimed the villagers,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Then let me continue&mdash;I am not
through yet,” said Keller. “You
believe, therefore, Herr Stechapfel,
that the Pope and all the bishops
erred when they maintained this
doctrine in the council?”</p>

<p>“Of course they erred; for they
invented a new article of faith,” answered
Stechapfel.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! That is too absurd!”
cried out some of those present.</p>

<p>“Do not laugh, men; it is not
a laughing matter,” said Keller.
“Now, Herr Stechapfel, since you
are to be our pastor, you can perhaps
explain something that I do
not understand. Our Lord instituted
an infallible teaching tribunal in
his church before he ascended to
heaven. That he was obliged to
institute this infallible tribunal I
can understand; for fifty years
would not have elapsed after his ascension,
before learned men would
have begun to misinterpret and distort
his doctrine. Therefore an
infallible tribunal was necessary,
that it might tell the people
what is and what is not the doctrine
of Christ. Our Lord has also promised
and given to this infallible
tribunal the Holy Ghost, that
he should remain with it unto
the end of the world, and establish
it in all truth. But now, this
tribunal, that is, the Pope and the
bishops, has declared that the Head
of the church is infallible when he
gives to the whole world a decision
or an interpretation concerning the
meaning of an article of faith or
morals. Now follows what I do not
understand. You New Protestants
maintain that it is not so. But if it
is not true, then the infallible tribunal
has erred; then our Lord has
told a falsehood. How does this all
agree, Herr Stechapfel?”</p>

<p>The counsellor and the priest
could not conceal their vexation.</p>

<p>“You are well instructed,” said
Schlehdorn.</p>

<p>“This is in consequence of having
had a good and zealous priest,” replied
the burgomaster. “Are you
not a New Protestant, Herr Counsellor?”</p>

<p>“By no means! I hold fast to
the original doctrine of the Holy
Catholic Church; therefore I am,
strictly speaking, an Old Catholic.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it!” exclaimed
Keller, with a fierce gleam in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
eyes. “You are a Freemason; although
you have shaved off your
beard and moustache, yet I know you.
Did you not a few days ago meet
three other Freemasons on the Vogelsberg
(mountain of birds)? Did
you not then say, ‘The trowel or
the cross’? Did you not say that
there was no God, no devil, no heaven,
no hell?”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken in the person,”
replied the astonished official, in
great embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” cried Ewald
consolingly. “Do not for that reason
excite yourself, Herr Counsellor.
We knew long ago that the New
Protestants had very little religion.
Who are the most zealous New Protestants?
Just those who never go
to confession or to holy communion.
They have wrapped themselves in
the little cloak of ‘Old Catholicism,’
so that they might work the better
against the Catholic Church.”</p>

<p>“Enough!” exclaimed the official,
who had regained his self-command.
“I am not here to expose myself to
rude attacks, but to introduce this
priest into his office.”</p>

<p>“That is not necessary!” exclaimed
the men. “You can take the
New Protestant at once back again
with you; we do not want him.”</p>

<p>“We are not in Bavaria,” said the
burgomaster. “We shall be faithful
to the Pope and his bishops; we
care nothing for the infallible professors.
We do not believe that any
man is infallible of himself; but the
Pope is infallible by virtue of his
office as teacher; and the Holy
Ghost is neither promised nor sent
to the professors.”</p>

<p>“Herr Burgomaster,” began the
counsellor sternly, “I make you responsible
for the safety and official
influence of Pastor Stechapfel.”</p>

<p>“Alas! Herr Counsellor, you have
asked too much!” replied the burgomaster.
“We in this village are
Catholics in the strictest sense of the
word. Therefore, we cannot have
Herr Stechapfel, because he is a
New Protestant. Do you imagine,
Herr Counsellor, that the people
will allow themselves to be commanded
in religious matters? Do
you think that our faith is to be
knocked into and out of our heads
by police-clubs, just because you
say the word? No; I refuse to become
answerable for the New Protestant
pastor you have brought us,
and I also assure you that, if he
enters the church, the people will
run out.”</p>

<p>Keller, who had evidently devised
some plan of action, gave the burgomaster
a secret sign.</p>

<p>“I think,” said he, “as the government
counsellor has come purposely
hither, we should give Herr
Stechapfel a trial. By the way of
beginning, you should introduce Herr
Stechapfel into the pastor’s residence.”</p>

<p>“You have spoken very wisely,”
answered Schlehdorn. “I must now
go; farewell, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>The official thereupon returned to
the city, and Stechapfel and the
burgomaster entered the priest’s
house.</p>

<p>Keller remained outside; he spoke
earnestly with the other men, and
the nature of his communication created
great but suppressed mirth
among them.</p>

<p>After a short interval, Keller and
Ewald appeared before Stechapfel.</p>

<p>“Have you maturely considered
the matter? It will not do,” commenced
Keller. “If it becomes
known in the village that an Old
Catholic New Protestant is here,
there would be a terrible tumult.
The people would be wild at the
thought of having a man as their
pastor who is more infallible than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
the Pope and the bishops, and who
is at the same time excommunicated.
To avert misfortune, you must leave
at once!”</p>

<p>“I protest against such treatment;
I shall remain!” exclaimed Stechapfel.</p>

<p>“You can protest as long as you
wish; it becomes you very well, for
you are a New Protestant!” replied
Keller indifferently. “But remain
here you cannot!”</p>

<p>“The government has sent me as
pastor to this village, and I shall
maintain my right to the position!”
exclaimed the Old Catholic.</p>

<p>“Bah! the government! That is
New Protestant nonsense! If you
were a Catholic, you would know
that the government has no right to
dispose of ecclesiastical offices. Offices
of the church are bestowed by
the church. Therefore, you must go!
Where is your hat?”</p>

<p>“This is an outrage; it is nothing
less than violence!”</p>

<p>“There, take your hat! I ask you
whether you will leave voluntarily?”</p>

<p>“No; I will not go!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, we will accompany
you until you are out of the village,”
said Keller; and he put his arm
under that of Stechapfel, while
Ewald executed the same manœuvre
on the other side. In vain did the
intruder resist. The strong men
took him out of the house, across the
yard, and through the village. The
people of Weselheim stood around
and laughed at the comical scene.</p>

<p>“Whom have you there?” asked
a passer-by.</p>

<p>“We have here an Old Catholic
New Protestant who has strayed
away from Bavaria. We are now
showing him the way out of the village.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” cried out
another, in surprise. “I hope you will
not lay hands on a priest?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Ewald; “we
only expel the wolf who wished to
creep in clothed as a sheep.”</p>

<p>A short distance out of the village,
the men halted.</p>

<p>“So, Herr Stechapfel, now you
can proceed alone,” said Franz Keller.
“If you wish to be again taken
out, then you must revisit us; it will
be a pleasure for us to escort you
as we have just done. If you are
really a duly ordained priest, then I
ask your pardon; but I have not to
ask pardon of you personally, for
you bear too close a resemblance to
the traitor Judas. You can tell the
gentlemen in the city that we in
Weselheim shall remain true to the
cross: the trowel the Freemasons
may keep for themselves. Good-by!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="pc1">APPEAL FOR HELP.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">From</span> the tower of the palace
floated a banner&mdash;a sign that the king
had taken up his residence there. In
the royal park, a gentleman in the
prime of life was walking. His countenance
bespoke a kind disposition,
and his dark eyes were full of spirit
and intelligence. He sought out the
most lonely paths, and seemed lost
in thought, while his gaze rested upon
the lovely flowers of the forest, the
green moss, and the gigantic oaks.
Hurried steps are heard coming up
the well-gravelled road; joy beams
from the face of the gentleman; he
stretches out his arms, presses the
youthful count to his bosom, and imprints
a kiss upon his forehead.</p>

<p>“Have you come at last, my
Adolph? How fresh and handsome
you look!”</p>

<p>“No wonder, your majesty! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
drink water, and eat potatoes with
sour milk,” replied the count merrily.</p>

<p>They walked on arm in arm. The
count was distantly related to the
king, who was a great lover of art,
and therefore took pride in the poetic
talents of his young relative.</p>

<p>“For how long has your majesty
freed yourself from the affairs of
state?” asked Adolph.</p>

<p>“For two weeks&mdash;a short time.
Even here I cannot rest; I have
promised an audience to many persons.”</p>

<p>“Why did you promise?”</p>

<p>“Because those who wish to see
me belong to a powerful organization,”
replied the king. “The grandmaster
of all the Freemasons of the
country will present an address to me&mdash;in
two days, I believe.”</p>

<p>“The grandmaster?” exclaimed
the count, taking his portfolio from
under his arm. “These leaves contain
both good and bad. To keep
either secret from the king would be
treason, and on my part a great violation
of my duty as his friend.”</p>

<p>“Have you written a drama?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your majesty; or rather, I
have copied one; you also are one
of the actors, as well as the grandmaster.
Can I begin to read?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; I am most anxious to
hear what you have written.”</p>

<p>Von Scharfenstein, after a few
words of introduction, described his
hiding-place in the forest, and the
circle of unsuspecting Freemasons
assembled at his feet. He then commenced
to read. The king listened
with undivided attention. Gradually
a dark frown settled upon his brow.</p>

<p>“Many thanks for your valuable
communication,” said he, when Von
Scharfenstein had finished reading.
“So I am a narrow-minded man
who does not rule, but is ruled! Outrageous
impertinence!”</p>

<p>“It is contemptible and vulgar;
but what else do you expect from
Freemasons!” answered the count.</p>

<p>“And these very Freemasons are
always professing to be the most obedient
servants of the crown,” said the
indignant king. “They are constantly
clamoring about the dangerous
designs of Rome upon other governments,
and they also pretend to decry
the intrigues of the ultramontanes!”</p>

<p>“In reality,” replied Von Scharfenstein,
“it is these men of the trowel
and apron who undermine the authority
of the crown; they make the people
hate their rulers, they violate and
wound the holiest feelings of subjects,
and they do this clothed in the garment
of official authority. I will give
you an example.” And the count related
the forcible expulsion of the
Jesuit father, and the request of the
inhabitants of Weselheim.</p>

<p>The king walked a few steps in
silence.</p>

<p>“Justice shall be given to the
oppressed, and punishment to the
guilty,” said he, and then turned towards
the palace.</p>

<p>Two days later, the councilmen
left their village, dressed in their best
attire, and carrying with them the
prayers of all the inhabitants. The
burgomaster led the procession,
followed by the others, until they
entered the royal park. The nearer
they approached the palace, the
slower were the footsteps of the men;
for it is no trifling matter for humble
subjects to enter the presence of their
king.</p>

<p>“George, do justice to our cause!”
said Ewald to the burgomaster.</p>

<p>“I will do all that I can, but you
must help me!” And the burgomaster
wiped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>They walked in respectful silence
upon the clean gravel-path that led
to the palace. At some distance
from them, they espied their good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
friend Count von Scharfenstein coming
up a by-road. He saw the diffidence
of the men, and saluted them
kindly, in order to infuse new courage
into them.</p>

<p>“The parish of Weselheim is held
in high estimation by the king, for
he only gives audience here to princes
and to very intimate friends,” said
he. “Therefore, you must speak
freely to him. The king likes a plain
and truthful statement of facts. At
the same time, my friends, the question
is, Can the king help you, that
is, for any time to come? There is
only one thing which will be of
help.”</p>

<p>“What does your lordship mean?”
inquired Keller.</p>

<p>“I mean that the Freemasons
and liberals aim at the destruction
of religion. They have worked at
this for many years, and not in vain.
They have succeeded in expelling
in many places a large number of
priests from the schools, so that the
children, if possible, may grow up
without religion. They have declared
war against conscientious bishops
and priests. At present they have
driven out the Jesuits, because they
are very active and zealous in the
discharge of their duty. After the
Jesuits will follow the other religious
orders, then the seminaries will be
closed, bishops and priests will be
deprived of their rights, and the
church as they imagine, will be rendered
helpless. It is a most cruel
tyranny, and a real stigma upon the
German name; but what can be
done? The tyrants are all powerful.”</p>

<p>“Our gracious king can put a
stop to their wickedness,” said the
burgomaster.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” replied
Scharfenstein. “The king cannot
do everything. He has sworn to
uphold the constitution, and he must
keep his oath. If, therefore, the representatives
of the country, the Chamber
of Deputies, make laws hostile to
religion, the king is often obliged to
confirm them. Consequently, only one
thing can really help you.”</p>

<p>“And what is it, if we are permitted
to ask your lordship?”</p>

<p>“It is for you to exercise more
prudence in the elections for the
Chamber and the Diet. Send pious,
religious men as your representatives
to the Diet, and then your religion
will not be insulted, and you will
have good laws. Why are the Freemasons
now in the ascendency in
the Chamber, in the ministry, in the
government, everywhere? And who
are to blame for it? The people,
yes, the people have given the reins
to their bitterest enemies. If the
Catholic people had elected proper
representatives, the Freemasons and
liberals would never have become
so powerful. If, therefore, the enemies
of religion use their power for
the destruction of the church and of
religious belief, it is very natural,
and the careless indifference of the
people is the cause of their triumph.”</p>

<p>“Your lordship is right,” answered
the burgomaster.</p>

<p>“It will be very different at the
next election,” said the other
men.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” remarked Von
Scharfenstein. “Remember what I
tell you. Only one thing will be of
lasting benefit to you, and that is to
send practical Catholics to the Diet;
and this you can do if you choose.
Unscrupulous men who do not believe
in God, in eternal reward or
punishment, do not hesitate to deprive
the people of their religious
rights, to impose oppressive taxes
upon them, and to make slaves of
free men!”</p>

<p>The villagers acquiesced in what
was said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish that we had never believed
the sweet-sounding words of
the liberals and their lying newspapers,”
remarked Ewald. “We
must really confess that, as a people,
we are too ignorant, and allow ourselves
to be too easily duped.”</p>

<p>“It is time for you to become
prudent,” replied the count.</p>

<p>The deputation had now reached
the palace.</p>

<p>“Do you see the man with the
long official staff in his hand, standing
there in the hall? Tell him
who you are, and he will take care
of you.” Saying this, Von Scharfenstein
saluted them, and returned
to the park.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="pc1">THE AUDIENCE.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">In</span> the audience-chamber there
stood three gentlemen in animated
conversation: the grandmaster and
two other Freemasons, the director,
and university professor. They were
handsomely dressed, and wore several
orders upon their breasts. They
seemed to be very familiar with their
surroundings, for they moved about
with perfect unconcern. The grandmaster
of the Freemasons especially
appeared to be full of his own importance,
and he glanced haughtily
at one of the king’s attendants when
he entered the apartment.</p>

<p>“Something has gone wrong to-day,”
said he, looking at his watch.
“It is already a quarter of an hour
after the appointed time. I have
never been treated so before.”</p>

<p>“I also remark something unusual,”
exclaimed the director. “There,
behind the table, stands a chair of
state. The king never seats himself
when giving audiences; why, therefore,
has this rule been violated?
There is a bell upon the table&mdash;what
does all this mean?”</p>

<p>“The king has his humors, no
doubt,” replied the grandmaster sarcastically,
placing meanwhile an address
upon the silver salver which
stood upon the table.</p>

<p>At once the folding-doors opened,
and the king entered, looking grave
and dignified. He advanced towards
the chair of state, and, placing his
hand upon it, he waited until those
present had finished bowing. No
gracious smile lighted up his features,
and he returned their salutation with
a scarcely perceptible nod of the
head.</p>

<p>“Most gracious majesty!” commenced
the grandmaster, “it cannot
have escaped your notice that a
serious disturbance threatens the
peace of the whole German Empire,
as well as the kingdom which is so
happy as to be governed by your wise
and prudent rule. The infallibility
of the Pope, so dangerous to the
state, and invented only to bring
princes and people under the sceptre
of the Roman Pontiff, has provoked
universal indignation. Everywhere
societies and meetings are protesting
against this usurpation of Rome. At
Munich and Darmstadt, good and
learned men have taken part in the
proceedings. In both cities, resolutions
were passed which your majesty
will be graciously pleased to
accept.”</p>

<p>The king silently took the address
from the salver, and laid it upon the
table.</p>

<p>“Your majesty will permit me to
remark,” continued the grandmaster,
“that, at the Protestant Diet of
Darmstadt, the Jesuits were specially
designated as the most dangerous
conspirators in the service of Rome,
and particularly hostile to the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Empire. Now, as the Society
of Jesus exists also in your majesty’s
dominions, we have ventured,
actuated solely by the interest we
take in the peace and political welfare
of the kingdom, to humbly petition
that your majesty will insist
upon the immediate expulsion of the
above-named society.”</p>

<p>“Are you a Catholic, Herr Counsellor
of the High Court?” asked the
king.</p>

<p>“Strictly Catholic, your majesty&mdash;strictly
Catholic,” replied the Freemason.
“I hold firmly to the old doctrines
of the Holy Catholic Church,
and shall resist with all my strength
the innovation of the last council.”</p>

<p>“According to what you say,
your petition asking for the suppression
of the Jesuits does not come
with such ill grace from you, for you,
as a Catholic, speak about Catholic
affairs,” said the king. “But why
a Protestant diet should meddle itself
with the ecclesiastical discipline
and religious belief of Catholics is
beyond my conception. The Catholics
also have public meetings;
but I never hear that they concern
themselves in the slightest degree
about Protestant matters. I am
aware of the resolutions passed by
the Protestant Diet of Darmstadt,
and regret them exceedingly, because
they are only calculated to grieve
Catholics, to disturb the peace, and
to seriously embarrass governments.
The Gustave Adolph Society is a
proof how, in former times, Protestants
have united themselves with the
foreign invader and destroyer of our
country against the Catholic Emperor
of Germany. Hostile treatment,
or even an attempt to suppress the
Catholic Church on the part of the
state, might in like manner force Catholic
Germans to unite themselves
with a foreign power in opposition
to the Protestant Emperor of Germany.
A faithful people are not in
need of forgiveness if they love their
God and their religion more than
they do the tyranny of their fatherland.”</p>

<p>The Freemasons were astonished;
they did not expect to hear the king
speak as he did.</p>

<p>“You make mention of the resolutions
of the glass palace at Munich,
which were also directed against the
Jesuits,” continued the king. “Do
you believe the grave accusations
which they bring against the Society
of Jesus?”</p>

<p>“I have the fullest conviction of
their truth,” replied the grandmaster,
bowing low.</p>

<p>The king now seated himself, and
looked through the address. The
men of the trowel cast significant
glances at each other.</p>

<p>“A ruler must be just; he should
never belong to a party,” said the
king. “You demand the suppression
of men who are highly respected
and venerated by thousands of
my subjects. The Burgomaster and
principal men of Weselheim are here
to petition for the restoration of their
pastor, a Jesuit father. If, after
hearing these men, I am convinced
that the actions of the Jesuits correspond
with the Munich resolutions,
then I will not be disinclined to
grant your request for the suppression
of the society; but, if the contrary,
then justice must be done!”</p>

<p>He rang a bell. The folding-doors
at the lower end of the <i>salon</i>
opened, and the burgomaster, together
with the councilmen of Weselheim,
entered, all looking anxious as
to the result of the interview. The
king rose from his chair, and his
whole manner changed; with a
friendly gesture, he invited the embarrassed
deputies to draw nearer.</p>

<p>“Ah! Herr Burgomaster, I am delighted
to see you again!” said he to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
the burgomaster, giving him his hand.
“You have not become older in the
course of the year&mdash;always young
and active. How are the trout?
Shall I see any more of them upon
my table?”</p>

<p>“O most gracious king!” replied
the delighted burgomaster, “the
whole parish will catch trout for
your majesty.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it!” rejoined
the king. “And how is your little
golden-haired son with the rosy
cheeks? Has he grown tall?”</p>

<p>“Two feet taller this year; your
majesty would not know him!”</p>

<p>The councilmen were enchanted.
The ice was broken.</p>

<p>“You desire your pastor, the Jesuit
father, to return to you again?”
began the king, seating himself in the
chair. “That is right; such a request
is honorable to you all. Parishioners
should always esteem a
worthy pastor. But, my dear people,”
he continued, “there are some difficulties.
It is asserted that the Jesuits
are men dangerous to the state;
that their teachings are destructive to
morals. It is further said that the
Jesuits conspire against the government;
that they are opposed to the
enlightenment of the people; and I
am therefore petitioned by some of
my subjects to authorize their expulsion.
These are the very words
contained in the address I hold in
my hand.”</p>

<p>The men looked at one another;
they evidently did not comprehend
the meaning of the accusations made
against the Jesuits.</p>

<p>“I ask pardon, your majesty;
but we do not understand you,” said
the burgomaster. “We know, indeed,
that there are many who hate the
Jesuits, and who wish to see them
exterminated, none more so than
the Freemasons. But your majesty
must not listen to such persons; for
even our Lord was accused by his
enemies of inciting the people, of
being dangerous to the state; and
they even went so far as to nail him
to the cross. If our Saviour would
come again to-day in the flesh, the
Freemasons would not be satisfied
until they had crucified him again.”</p>

<p>The king cast a quick look at the
flushed countenances of the Freemasons.</p>

<p>“I ask you, upon your conscience,”
said he to the burgomaster, “if your
Jesuit father ever taught immoral
doctrines?”</p>

<p>“O great heaven!” exclaimed
the excited burgomaster. “Immoral
doctrines&mdash;our pastor? Why,
your majesty, he is like a saint, and
he does his best to make saints of
the whole parish. If two young
persons of a different sex live together
without being married, our pastor
never rests until both have given up
their scandalous life and are married.
If enmities exist, and lawsuits and
quarrels, our pastor is indefatigable
until he effects a reconciliation.
Thus, our pastor is like an angel for
our parish. Formerly there were
many who hated each other; we
had dissensions among ourselves;
but now everything is peaceable and
quiet in the village, and all this we
owe to our pastor, the Jesuit father.”</p>

<p>“And what he does for the children
is beyond belief, your majesty,”
said Keller. “He visits the schools
every day; the children love him.
In <i>former</i> times, parents had to command
the children to pray in the
morning and the evening; <i>now</i> they
pray without being told to do so.
And our children are so obedient,
for our pastor impresses upon them
the full importance of the fourth
commandment.”</p>

<p>“Has your pastor no enemies in
the parish?” inquired the king.</p>

<p>“Yes, most gracious majesty; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
has enemies, that is, three rascals,
who would like to see him driven
out,” said the burgomaster.</p>

<p>“You see, gentlemen,” said the
king to the officials, “that your accusations
against the Jesuits are by no
means confirmed.”</p>

<p>“The Jesuit of Weselheim may
perhaps be an exception,” replied the
grandmaster.</p>

<p>Franz Keller seemed possessed
with a desire to speak, but he controlled
his impatience.</p>

<p>“Your majesty will excuse me
for saying that the accusations
against the Jesuits appear very surprising
to me,” remarked Ewald.
“In the Bible, we read that the Jews
dragged our Saviour before the high-priests,
and accused him of different
crimes. And when our Saviour defended
himself, one of the servants
struck him in the face, whereupon
our Saviour said: ‘If I have spoken
evil, give testimony of the evil; but,
if well, why strikest thou me?’ It
is the same with the Jesuits. If they
are really as wicked and criminal as
their enemies assert, well, let them
be brought before the law, and be
punished according to the law.
But if nothing can be proved against
them, why continue to slander and
persecute them, and to treat them
like murderers and thieves?”</p>

<p>“Very well said, and very true!”
answered the king.</p>

<p>“Most gracious king, I can tell
you what people are against the
Jesuits&mdash;the Freemasons,” began Keller,
unable any longer to keep quiet.
“A short time ago, I heard them talking
on the Vogelsberg. These three
gentlemen (pointing to the Freemasons)
were there, and one other.
The one with the gray beard said:
‘The trowel or the cross, that is the
watchword!’ Then they all declared
that the religion of Christ must
be exterminated; and, because the
Jesuits are good preachers and zealous
priests, therefore they must be
the first to be overthrown. And they
also said that, when the altars were
destroyed, the thrones must be demolished.
What else they said,
most gracious king, I will not grieve
you by repeating.”</p>

<p>The king looked silently, but with
an expression of severe displeasure,
at the officials.</p>

<p>“Will your majesty permit us to
withdraw?” inquired the grandmaster.</p>

<p>“You will remain; we have not
finished yet,” replied the king sternly.</p>

<p>“Most gracious king,” entreated
the burgomaster, “be kind enough
to look through the window.”</p>

<p>The king did as requested, and
saw at the foot of the hill the whole
parish of Weselheim congregated
together&mdash;men, women, and children.
They all stood with their faces turned
towards the palace. Many knelt
upon the ground. The king was
visibly affected at the sight.</p>

<p>“The whole village unite with us
in asking your majesty to give us
back our dear, good, pious Jesuit
father,” said the burgomaster.</p>

<p>At this moment, a chamberlain
appeared, and handed the king a
written communication.</p>

<p>“He is very welcome; admit him
at once!” commanded the king.</p>

<p>The delegation were attentive
spectators of what was transpiring.
In the antechamber they heard the
voice of the pastor, who now entered
the <i>salon</i>, and was most graciously
received by the king. The presence
of royalty alone prevented loud exclamations
of delight from his parishioners,
whose faces shone with joy.</p>

<p>“The Society of Jesus was very
active during the last war,” said the
king, after certain formalities had been
gone through. “How many German
Jesuits were on the scene of
action?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nearly all, your majesty&mdash;one
hundred and eighty-eight,” replied
the Jesuit. “Our older members
took care of the sick; for, during the
war, all our colleges were converted
into hospitals.”</p>

<p>“No proof of hostility to the state,”
remarked the king, turning to the
officials. “How many Freemasons
were employed in attending to the
sick and wounded in the hospitals
during the war?”</p>

<p>“The care of the sick does not belong
to the vocation of a Freemason,”
answered the grandmaster shortly.</p>

<p>“Much is said and written to-day
concerning the extraordinary power of
the Jesuits,” said the king to the reverend
father. “I have in vain endeavored
to discover the secret of this
power; you may perhaps be able to
enlighten me on the subject?”</p>

<p>“Your majesty, the so-called power
of the Jesuits is a mere phantom invented
by our enemies to excite the
fears of the credulous,” answered the
priest. “In fact, the Jesuits are, of
all men, the weakest. They are
slandered, persecuted, suppressed.
In many places, they have not even
the right to exist or to breathe, as in
Bavaria and Switzerland. All societies
are protected in Bavaria, all
associations can exist in Switzerland,
except the Society of Jesus. If the
Jesuits, therefore, possessed in reality
the power claimed for them, they
would not permit their members to
be treated like slaves, as they now
are.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” rejoined the king.
“Being a foreigner, your reverence
had to abandon the sphere of your
labor; but now I grant you the right
of a subject, and liberty to return to
your mission. May you live many
years to be a blessing to the parish
of Weselheim!”</p>

<p>He took the hand of the priest, and
led him to the village delegation.</p>

<p>“Here, you have your pastor back
again! Honor and obey him!” said
he to them.</p>

<p>“Most gracious king, may Almighty
God reward you a thousand
times for what you have done!” exclaimed
the men, down whose cheeks
the tears were streaming; and, if two
of the chamberlains had not interfered,
and led them out of the <i>salon</i>,
they would have committed many
breaches of etiquette, so great was
their joy.</p>

<p>The king now approached the
Freemasons; his manner was cold,
but his eyes were ablaze with indignation.</p>

<p>“I thank divine Providence,” said
he, “for having exposed before my
eyes the cunning and malicious snare
in which you sought to entrap me.
The Jesuits are not the enemies of
culture nor of the state; but the
Freemasons are. The foundation
of culture is Christianity, and not
Freemasonry, which is the enemy
of Christianity. In my kingdom,
the cross, and not the trowel
shall be the symbol of government.
The Jesuits neither teach nor practise
a false and corrupt morality, but the
Freemasons do, for they seek to overthrow
not only altars but thrones.
The Freemasons are unscrupulous,
false, and perjured officials, for they
have presumed to say that their king
to whom they have sworn fidelity
was a narrow-minded man who did
not govern, but was governed! It
would be nothing more than just to
have the whole order prosecuted for
high treason!”</p>

<p>The excited king ceased speaking.
The Freemasons, who at first looked
defiant and unconcerned, now trembled
with fright. His majesty stood
for a while in perfect silence. From
the foot of the hill resounded many
hundred voices chanting the grand
hymn of praise, the German <i>Te Deum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
while they accompanied their
beloved pastor to the village.</p>

<p>The king, who had recovered his
self-command, now pronounced the
following sentence: “The director,
the Counsellor of the High Court, the
professor of the university, and the
government counsellor Schlehdorn
are from this time forth deprived of
their offices. I shall not institute
judicial proceedings against them,
out of regard to the feelings of their
innocent families!”</p>

<p>The king turned, and left the <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p>The Freemasons looked at one
another. Upon the lips of the grandmaster
an ironical, revengeful smile
was seen.</p>

<p>“A blow in the water will startle
any one, if it is given unexpectedly,”
said he, “and our present discomfiture
is only of that nature!” he continued,
with a peculiar movement of
the hand, and in language whose
obscure meaning they evidently understood.
“Brethren, our labors in a
small sphere are only discontinued
that we may resume the work on a
grander scale; for the trowel of the
Freemasons shall yet build the arch
that covers the grave of the greater
as well as of the smaller!”</p>

<p>The other Freemasons bowed
affirmatively to the words of the
grandmaster, and followed him out
of the <i>salon</i>.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c486" id="c486">WHAT IS CIVILIZATION?</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> word civilization, adopted
into almost every European language,
is derived from the Latin of
<i>civitas</i>, a city, and <i>civis</i>, a citizen.
Webster thus defines civilization:
“It consists in the progressive improvement
of society considered as a
whole, and of all the individual
members of which it is composed.”
And further: “A well-ordered state
of society, culture, refinement.”
Now, it is worth while to inquire into
the tangible ideal of that people
to whose language we are indebted
for this comprehensive word. The
Romans considered their empire the
appointed head, by divine right, of
the whole world. They could not
take in the idea of their supremacy
being disputed, much less resisted,
and hence the proud motto, “<i>Civis
Romanus sum</i>,” which was meant to
express the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of human
dignity. No greater honor could be
bestowed upon a stranger, whether
ally or conquered foe, than to make
him a Roman citizen. It was a title
more valuable than that of Cæsar; it
had privileges attached to it which
neither the blood of a Machabee nor
an Alexander could claim; it compelled
greater respect than the heroism
of a Leonidas or the uprightness
of a Socrates. Thus early had false
notions of material civilization corrupted
the genuine meaning of a
word which should always stand,
not for political supremacy, but for
moral excellence. Rome, the heart
of the dominant empire which had
vanquished and absorbed at least
two civilizations of higher degree
than its own, the Hebrew and the
Greek, has transmitted to the word
civilization the spirit of its intensely
local autonomy. Every kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
word derived from the same root
has a like meaning, especially “civility,”
a synonyme of “urbanity” (from
<i>urbs</i>, a city), thereby conveying the
insinuation that city customs alone
have that grace and refinement
necessary to pleasant social intercourse.
Another meaning naturally
flowed from this arbitrary assumption
of perfection to imperial Rome. Civil
came to mean national as opposed to
foreign; as we say, for instance, civil,
for intestine, war. More or less all
nations of the world have adopted
this way of looking upon civilization
as a local thing; and, to the
greater majority of mankind, there
is a certain flavor of disparagement
implied in the terms foreign and
foreigner. We speak in a tone of
half-concealed pity of men from far-off
countries, as if they must needs
be a little lower in the scale of creation
than our enlightened selves.
We have not forgotten that “barbarian”
and “foreigner” were terms
used interchangeably by the Greeks,
and our local pride still unconsciously
crops out in the most childish and
laughable demonstrations. Nothing
shows better how very arbitrary is
the interpretation of the word civilization
than our various estimates of
its essence. The Chinese who wears
yellow for mourning smiles compassionately
at the European in his
dusky garment of sorrow; and the
European who is accustomed to eat
his dinner with a knife and fork
thinks that a nation can hardly be
civilized which tolerates the use of
chop-sticks. To come nearer home,
we have known an Englishman of
distinguished birth and position
refuse the hand of his daughter to a
French diplomat, a nobleman of the
old stock, an accomplished gentleman,
a rich land-owner, for the
weighty reason that “he was a foreigner”!</p>

<p>The word “barbarian” (from the
Greek <i>βάρβαρος</i>) is given in Webster’s
<i>Dictionary</i> as meaning, in the first
and literal sense, foreign. Barber or
Barbar was originally the native
name of a part of the coast of Africa.
The Egyptians, fearing and hating
its inhabitants, used their name as a
term of contumely and dread, in
which sense it passed to the Greeks
and Romans. Thus the kindred
words barbarous and barbarity have
kept the meaning of “cruel and
ferocious,” but the main stock of
<i>βάρβαρος</i> generally signifies the two
almost synonymous things, “foreigner”
and “barbarian”! The imitative
sound of <i>barber</i> was applied by
the Greeks to the ruder tribes whose
pronunciation was most harsh and
whose grammar most defective.
Dr. Campbell says that the Greeks
were the first to brand a foreign term
in any of their writers with the odious
name of barbarism. This word
with the Greeks had the additional
general meaning of ignorance of
art and want of learning, and as
such has been used by Dryden.
Barbaric remains to this day the
synonyme of foreign and quaint, far-fetched,
as Milton, following the
Greeks, has used it:</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“The gorgeous East with richest hand,<br />
Showers on her kings <i>barbaric</i> gold and pearl.”</p>

<p class="p1">But Dryden has also put the more
unusual word barbarous for the same
thing:</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“The trappings of his horse embossed with <i>barbarous</i> gold.”</p>

<p class="p1">The misapplication of all these
terms, and more especially of “civilization,”
is of daily recurrence. We
cannot open a newspaper without
seeing its self-eulogium expressed in
the term “a journal of civilization”;
we cannot read a leading article on
the financial prosperity of the country
without finding it confidently
stated that such prosperity is an infallible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
sign of civilization; we hear
of railroads “carrying civilization”
among the wild tribes of Central
Africa; and we see atheism and
false science parading their unhappy
progress as the “march of civilization.”</p>

<p>Now, admitting the very just definition
we have quoted above, that
civilization is “the progressive improvement
of society <i>as a whole</i>,
and of each individual member of
which it is composed,” it seems to
us conclusive that only one perfect
form of it could exist on earth, <i>i.e.</i>
that which flourished for a short
time in the Garden of Eden. Mankind
in the state of innocence was
<i>ipso facto</i> civilized, and civilized to
the highest moral and intellectual
degree possible to mere human
creatures. Had there been no original
sin, and had Adam’s posterity
continued in utter sinlessness to
inhabit the peaceful and fruitful
earth, we should have had that well-ordered
state of society in which the
only progressive improvement would
have been ever-increasing love and
knowledge of God.</p>

<p>But this, the only perfect civilization,
was lost with all other precious
gifts&mdash;incorruptibility, innocence, and
clear insight into the things of God.
The state of grace followed the state
of innocence, and man, having fallen
from his innate mastership over nature
when he fell from his mastership
over himself, found that civilization
and progressive improvement must
henceforward mean nothing to him
but the painful effort to regain as
much of his former power as God
would allow him, in guerdon of his
repentance, to regain. All civilization
since the Fall, therefore, has been
only approximative, and can never
be more than this. This explains
why the highest civilization has been
attained only since Christianity has
prevailed, the state of accomplished
redemption being the most perfect
mankind has yet reached, superseding
even the state of expectancy of the
Hebrew dispensation. It explains,
too, why the Jews were the most
civilized of all ancient nations&mdash;a
point to which we will refer at greater
length in another place. From
the few details briefly mentioned in
Genesis, we infer that the earliest
civilization after the Fall was by no
means inferior to our own as far as
material prosperity was concerned.
Besides the obvious callings of husbandman
and shepherd, always the
first and indeed indispensable foundation
of civilized life, we find that during
the lifetime of Adam, <i>i.e.</i>, the
first thousand years after the Creation,
cities were built and the arts
cultivated. Cain was the first to
build and organize a town, and his
descendant Jubal is called the father
of “them that play on the harps and
organ.” Tubal Cain was “a hammerer
and artificer in every work of brass
and iron.” Hunting and the use of
weapons were of course familiar to
the pioneers of the human race, for
tradition tells us that it was while
hunting that Lamech slew a man,
supposed by some to have been
Cain, mistaking him for a wild beast.
It was not long before solemn religious
ceremonies were instituted, as
appears from this passage: “This
man (Enos) began to call upon the
name of the Lord,” which is thus interpreted:
although Adam and Seth
had called upon the name of the
Lord before the birth of their son
and grandson Enos, yet Enos used
more solemnity in the worship and
invocation of God. The natural
bent of fallen man, however, prevailed
over the efforts of a few faithful souls,
and that material civilization which,
could we in imagination reconstruct
its gorgeous completeness, would undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
not fall below that of the
great empires of Assyria, Egypt, or
Persia, led surely though insensibly
to moral corruption. The fatal beauty
of the women of Cain’s race, “the
daughters of men,” their wealth too,
doubtless their worldly prosperity
and lavish display, tempted the descendants
of Seth, “the sons of God,”
till, in a few hundred years, “all flesh
had corrupted its way,” and “it repented
God that he had made man.”
This was the first example of the deteriorating
effect of mere animal civilization,
and, alas! how faithfully has
it been copied in all ages since!
How persistently and with what unwearying
perseverance have its details
of profligacy been imitated by
the succeeding generations of mankind!</p>

<p>A historical review of each separate
attempt at civilization made by
the dispersed nations after the building
of the Tower of Babel would be
a serious task, and its result too long
for these pages; but, before we leave
this part of our subject to turn to the
more abstract question of the essence
of civilization, let us stop to
remark what a high pitch of human
culture had already been attained in
times so remote that, save through
revelation, no memorial of them remains
to us. Wendell Phillips has
partially developed this idea in his
lecture on the “Lost Arts,” proving
that three-fourths of our <i>discoveries</i> are
plagiarisms, that our best witticisms
are borrowed from the Indian and
the Greek, and that our most boasted
arts are but gropings in the dark
after some vanished ideal of antiquity.
And how much more learning
than we can conjecture must there not
be utterly buried out of sight in the
sealed records of antediluvian times!
The only likeness which we can safely
boast of with those colossal days
is the likeness of unbelief and corruption.
The “mighty men of old,”
of whom the Bible so mysteriously
speaks, were doubtless as much
above our standard of intellect and
even of prosperity as vulgar superstition
ranges them above our standard
of physical strength and height.
A veil of mystery shrouds them and
their lives from our utmost research,
and we know only one thing for certain;
that is, their sin and its awful
doom&mdash;little more than is told us
of the fall of Lucifer and his angels,
yet enough to teach us that all civilizations
which in their arrogance
dare to defy the laws of God must
inevitably fall beneath his rod.</p>

<p>And now, what <i>is</i> civilization?
What <i>is</i> the “good of society considered
as a whole”?</p>

<p>Two things are indispensable to it&mdash;the
inviolability of the family, and
the stability of the laws of property.
On these two pillars, humanly speaking,
is society built, and whatever is
antagonistic to these fundamental
principles is necessarily and directly
antagonistic to civilization.</p>

<p>Paternal and patriarchal government
was the first known because
the most natural; and, when the increasing
number of families confused
the original system and complicated
its duties, the ruler chosen to take
charge of the whole tribe or nation
still looked to no higher title than
that of <i>father</i> of his people. The
stability of the laws regulating property
was in all lands reckoned the
gauge of prosperity and the test
of national vigor. The desire of
personal possession, of undisputed
ownership over a tract of land however
small, is a natural and legitimate
instinct of man; its realization alone
can bring with it to each individual
that independence, that self-respect,
which, in the aggregate, creates the
feeling of national honor. Patriotism
is not an intangible virtue; it springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
from the broader basis of domestic
affection; it follows the feeling of responsibility
induced by the knowledge
of having a personal stake in
your country’s advancement. The
Romans have left us their motto:
<i>Pro aris et focis</i>&mdash;“For our altars and
our hearths.” If we could no longer
qualify these hearths as <i>ours</i>, what a
lessened interest they must necessarily
have in our eyes! The man
who works for himself alone is reckless
even if brave, lukewarm even if
conscientious. He may do his work,
but he does it without enthusiasm.
He who works for those near and
dear to him, to gain or defend a
patrimony for those who in the future
will take his place and bear his name,
is gentle, considerate, patient, far-seeing,
persevering, as well as brave
and conscientious. But granted that
these social and domestic laws are
well-guarded, in what else does
civilization consist? There are four
things which dispute the title to
forming the highest test of a well-ordered
state of society: riches,
political freedom, education, and religion.
Some men would combine
these elements in varied quantities
to form <i>their</i> ideas of civilization;
others would sink every element but
one, and try the experiment as long
as it could be made to minister to
their own private aggrandizement;
others, again, look for the visionary
supremacy of one element alone, and
the subordination to itself of every
other, whether baser or nobler. We
need not say to which class we hope
to belong&mdash;the sequel will show.</p>

<p>Does civilization consist in riches,
whether national or individual?
True, the command of wealth inspires
respect in neighboring peoples; for
national wealth means large resources,
speedy armaments, flourishing
colonies, and means of thwarting the
commerce of lesser nations. But national
wealth is seldom attained unless
from the basis of individual
wealth. It is impossible for the state
to absorb and administer such resources
as these, and yet to compel
private citizens to lead lives of
Spartan frugality. The individual
cannot be made to acknowledge any
right on the part of the state which
will interfere with his own right of
accumulating capital, provided he
makes over to the government a fair
share of his profits in the shape of
legitimate tribute. Private wealth
then becomes the source of private
luxury and extravagance, and behind
extravagance lurks moral decay.
Factitious wants are created, an abnormal
state of society is brought
about, unmanning the body and
weakening the mind. To many men,
riches simply suggest new means of
indulging in vice; and to all men, vice,
in the long run, means disease. Material
prosperity has thus reached its
apogee, has overshot its mark, and
has found a fitting punishment in
physical deterioration. There is yet
another side to the question. Inordinate
riches in the hands of a few,
especially if unsupported by territorial
prestige, by hereditary honors and
the semi-feudal spirit which in Europe
still links the agricultural and
landed interests in personal association,
are apt to breed class jealousies,
and to estrange labor from capital.
A civil war far more terrible than an
armed insurrection is set on foot
and slowly undermines the political
structure. It is true that the most
fatal example of this kind was the
upheaval of the French Revolution
of ‘93, and that it took place under
a monarchical government; but,
though monarchical, it was not a
feudal government, and the men
whose birth, wealth, and station
marked them out as the victims of
the people’s rage were essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
men whose associations had long
been dissevered from the land. Their
estates had been abandoned to unscrupulous
agents or sold to ambitious
<i>roturiers</i>; and for what reason?
That its price might cover their needless
display at an unstable court!
At the present day, where is socialistic
agitation most rife in Europe? In
the manufacturing towns: not in the
agricultural districts. Almost to a
man, every factory-gang is ready to
turn against its employer; while, in
the country, laborers will even die in
the defence of their landlords. In
the former case, the master is always
a “self-made” man, a man of the
people, or at least one whose associations
are obscure; in the latter,
the master is the hereditary representative
of gentle blood and gentle
nurture, the personal friend of each
man on his estate, identified with the
neighborhood, and attached to the
soil.</p>

<p>The verdict of history has certainly
gone against the theory that
times of material luxury, pushed to
its furthest extent, are therefore times
of great national prosperity. Athens
was at the height of her ultra-refined
civilization when the rude and
martial Roman conquered her autonomy;
Rome herself, made effeminate
by the conquering vices of her
conquered foe, was at the giddiest
pinnacle of merely physical prosperity
when the resistless tide of the
barbarians poured over her frontiers;
Spain had just grasped the New
World with its teeming riches when
she fell from her political supremacy
in the Old; France was revelling in
her Augustan Age when the tocsin
of the Revolution woke her from her
dalliance. Great wealth has everywhere
been the herald of national
misfortune; and, as if to set off this
truth yet more palpably, we have the
republics of Sparta and of Switzerland
to show us that, both in classic
and in modern times, frugality is the
best preservative of freedom.</p>

<p>But the existence of abnormal
wealth as a criterion of civilization
has yet another phase. If it is possible
under a republican form of government
and under a constitutional
régime, it is still more likely to reach
gigantic proportions under a despotic
system. Thus the East produces
more princely fortunes than even the
“enlightened” West, because, wealth
being restricted to fewer individuals,
it follows that these few fortunes
must be colossal. Unlimited pomp,
dazzling trains of slaves and camels,
a fabulous blaze of gems, a limitless
harem, seem to be matters of course
for the favored few whose almost
omnipotence has become proverbial
among men as typical of the East.
Therefore, if wealth be a gauge of
civilization, we must conclude that
despotism is the most civilized of
states, since it is certainly the most
favorable to the accumulation of
riches. If so (and, for the sake of
argument, let us grant it), how shall
we reconcile this conclusion with
the claims of the second and, according
to some, infallible test of
civilization&mdash;political freedom?</p>

<p>We understand by this the extreme
of so-called self-government, the
government by ballot and universal
suffrage. We have had but very
lately many signs of its woful fallibility;
we have seen how cleverly it
can throw the cloak of legality over
the most unblushing frauds; we have
seen hired violence control the very
medium of government itself. Men
who respected themselves would as
soon touch pitch as defile their
hands with voting tickets, or stand
up by the side of illegally naturalized
citizens, pressed into momentary
service by the unscrupulous manipulators
of the ballot-box. A form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
government which in theory is more
perfect than any other, and more in
accordance with ideal human dignity,
but which in sober practice has
sometimes been found an inadequate
safeguard against corrupting influences,
is not apt to strike any one who
has been familiar with the results of
the last few years’ political wire-pulling
as the most exalted criterion of civilization.
The cant phrase of political
freedom has unhappily come to
mean political corruption, which
hardly entitles this second candidate
for the exclusive patent of civilization
to a lengthened discussion in
these pages. The third is education.</p>

<p>This is certainly a more plausible
test than the two former. Learning,
the arts, the sciences, the classics, all
relate to the higher part of man’s
nature, and reflect honor on those
who strive to be their interpreters.
This seems worthy of man, akin to
his primeval state, and like the occupation
of his future life. But alone
even education cannot stand. When
dissevered from religion, it falls, either
into atheism or fanaticism, sometimes
into both. At least one example of
its pernicious moral results when
thus left to itself is the brilliant
shame of the Medicean renaissance.
In the new groves of Academe, the
ducal gardens of Fiesole, heathen
voluptuousness speedily followed
heathen philosophy; polished manners
and elegant diction redeemed
loose morals and equivocal conversation;
Christianity was voted <i>barbarous</i>,
and Christian pageants uncouth.
It was the age of Boccaccio.
The poison spread far and wide, the
fever of a misdirected and one-sided
education seized all classes, and the
fathers of the church were forgotten
for the lascivious poets of Greece
and Rome. The mysteries of Bona
Dea were almost enacted over again,
the dances of Bacchus were revived,
and the processions of Venus and
Cupid took the place of Christian
solemnities. The corruption was
thus forced on the people, who, excited
by gorgeous public entertainments
of pagan complexion, caught the
hollow enthusiasm of their rulers,
and emulated the servile Romans of
the empire who cried out, <i>Panem et
circenses</i>, while they blindly surrendered
their freedom into the crowned
showman’s hands. Material prosperity
and godless learning combined,
stifled the last semblance of
Florentine liberty under the rule of
the Medici. In France it was atheism
concealed under the guise of
learning which prepared the way for
the Revolution of ‘93; it was the delicately
veiled irony, and the sportive
unbelief of Voltaire’s disciples, which
first made the “little rift within the
lute.” The savage leaders of the
Reign of Terror had nothing to do
save crown with the guillotine the
elaborate system of corruption already
founded by the “philosophers.”</p>

<p>Education without religion has
been as treacherous and as frail a support
to the civilization of men as the
reed that pierces the hand of him who
leans upon it; political freedom (?)
without religion has been only another
name for a retrograde movement
towards anarchy, and material
wealth without the controlling influence
of religion has proved the
most dangerous because the most
emasculating of allies to those nations
who have built their civilization
on its basis.</p>

<p>Each and all of these experiments
have fallen far short of the ideal of
the Garden of Eden, and each has
practically confessed by its failure the
radical infirmity of the theory it represented.
The reason is self-evident:
a system which undertakes to
guide the complex workings of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
nature cannot afford to disregard
any of nature’s manifold instincts,
and, by obstinately refusing
to give a place to all legitimate aspirations,
overbalances itself, and falls
sooner or later into a trap of its own
setting. You cannot govern man
through his animal wants alone or
through his intellectual yearnings
only, any more than you can rule
him solely through his spiritual instincts.
He must be fed, clothed,
and housed, true, but this alone will
not satisfy him; his reason cries out
for development and exercise, and
his heart also puts in a claim to the
notice of any one who would undertake
to rule him. It is true that
man is not an angel, and that spiritual
food alone would not allay his
hunger, but it is equally true that he
is not a brute being, to be abundantly
satisfied with good fodder and a
dry stable. His nature is threefold:
animal, intellectual, and spiritual,
and claims an equal recognition of
each of its phases. Neither mere
riches addressed to the contentment
of his lower instincts, nor mere educational
and political advantages addressed
to the satisfaction of his
nobler self, are enough for his welfare;
his soul is a higher region yet,
and one which demands yet more
imperatively an adequate amount
of attention. This soul it is which,
when bound and blinded as it but
too often is in mere worldly systems
of civilization, ends by grasping, like
Samson, the insecure supports of this
partial civilization itself, and in the
untamed strength of despair dragging
down the fabric in ruins at its
feet.</p>

<p>There remains one more element
which is still claimed by a brave
minority, as the essence of all true
civilization, and that is religion.
This is the most comprehensive criterion
of a “well-ordered” state of
society, for it includes all the rest
as a matter of course. Religion is
not incompatible with the possession
and accumulations of wealth,
as some erroneously suppose, but she
requires that such interests shall be
amenable to the dictates of moderation,
and of charity; she does not
scout learning as an ally, but eagerly
welcomes it, so long as it keeps
within its province and does not use
its power to stifle the spiritual nature
of man; she is no enemy to
political freedom or to any particular
form of government whatever, but
she firmly resists the claims to omnipotence
which every strong government,
whether popular or absolutist,
has in the hour of its worldly
triumph invariably made. With a
wisdom the counterpart of that which
equalizes and controls the various
forces of nature, religion holds in her
hand the various emotions, passions,
and necessities of man, and balances
according to a divine standard the
proportions in which each one may
be legitimately satisfied. She subordinates
the lower satisfactions to
the higher, in exact proportion as
the lower nature of mankind is, or
should be, subordinate to the higher;
she places delegates in each inferior
sphere, that there may be no violence
done to the spiritual order in furthering
the interests of the material; she
bids honesty watch over the legitimate
increase of wealth, integrity
temper the efforts of men in the
cause of political freedom, and reverence
guide them in the pursuit of
learning. She gathers up these single
threads of our lives, and, weaving
them into a triple cord, imparts to
them a strength which her blessing
alone can confer, and which individually
they could never have attained.
It is she alone who skilfully brings
within the practical reach of the poor,
the oppressed, and of the ignorant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
those theories which in the mouth of
worldly apostles seem either poetical
dreams or subversive and socialistic
principles. It is she who is the
true reformer, the true progressist,
the true patriot. But why is she so?
Simply because she is also the only
true conservatrix in the world. Her
mission is to foster the good, to seek
it out, to make it known, to assimilate
it to herself, to absorb it into
her system. Material good is not excluded;
wherever it is, it belongs of
right to her; whether it be old or
new, foreign or native, it matters not,
religion takes it into her bosom,
gives it immortality, sanctions its
use, recommends its adoption. Being
founded on the rock of truth, she can
safely stoop to draw from the wreck
of error any fragment of good contained
in it, whether it be a scientific,
a literary, or a domestic addition to
the stock of ideas which is the common
property of human nature, and
of which she stands the perpetual
guardian. This broad, open-armed,
fearless, progressive spirit is the
nearest approach to the ideal of the
lost paradise: this is civilization&mdash;this
is Christianity.</p>

<p>As an example of the superiority
of religion over any other test of
civilization, let us return for a moment
to what we have said of the
Jews. To the only reasonable and
dignified conception of the Godhead
known to the nations of old, they
added the only worthy conception
of human duties and responsibilities.
Their domestic system was the only
one in which woman bore a seemly
part; their political organization,
whether in the desert, under Moses and
his “rulers over thousands, and over
hundreds, and over fifties, and over
tens”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> (the same division afterwards
prevalent in the Roman army), or in
the land of Chanaan under the Judges,
was essentially self-governing,
federal, and independent. Their laws
were minute in detail and stringent
in execution, not only after their
establishment as a nation in Chanaan,
but during the forty years of
their nomadic existence in the wilderness,
a period which with any
other people would have been one
of irremediable lawlessness. Compacts
and treaties are mentioned in
the Bible even before the direct segregation
from the world of what was
afterwards known as the people of
Israel. Abraham and Lot agreed
solemnly and peaceably to settle
the differences between their followers,
by each tribe taking up its abode
within certain given limits; Abraham
and Abimelech came to a public
understanding, the former meaning
to do the heathen and alien leader
no harm, and the latter restoring a
well of which his servants had possessed
themselves by force; Abraham
insisted upon paying a full and
fair equivalent in money to the
Hethite who offered him <i>gratis</i> the
funeral cave of Mambre; Eleazar
made between Isaac and Rebecca a
formal marriage contract; Esau
when he had voluntarily sold his
birthright, though at the bidding of
necessity, was bound to hold by his
rash cession; Jacob made and faithfully
kept with his uncle Laban an
engagement to give him his services
for fair wages for a given number of
years. Such social compacts, rigorously
adhered to even when made
with idolaters, are among the most
convincing proofs of the high state
of a country’s civilization, and present
a strange, suggestive contrast
with the rude polity of nations who,
at that time and even many ages
later, knew no right of property save
that of forcible possession, and no
guarantee of good faith save that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
which the sword could enforce. Attention
to the duties of hospitality,
another prominent sign of civilization,
was a characteristic of the Jews.
We have so many Biblical examples
of this that it is impossible to give
them. The division of the community
into fixed orders of occupation
is another recognized sign of an advanced
state of society. Of course
this and many others were held by
the Jews in common with several
nations of heathendom, some eminently
distinguished for heroism, for
honor, for learning, etc; and yet
which of all the polished nations of
antiquity had not some festering sore
of pauperism, superstition, or barbarity,
to conceal beneath its fair
outside of dazzling “civilization”?
The people of God, on the contrary,
the only representatives of the true
religion, were free from such social
ulcers, and, even when their history
shocks us by scenes of mysterious
cruelty, it is universally admitted
that the hand of God was working
through them, and that they were
but as instruments wielded in the
dark by a power mightier than
themselves.</p>

<p>Agriculture, or the “arts of peace,”
called by some the representative of
civilization, was an honored calling
among the Hebrews. The riches of
Judith and of Booz were fields and
cattle; the promises of future prosperity
scattered through Holy Writ
are always typified by “fields and
vineyards”; the inheritances and
dowers of the sons and daughters of
Israel were herds and fields, and so
jealous was each tribe of its landed
possessions that it was enacted that
its members should intermarry only
among themselves, under pain of
forfeiting all claim to the legal portion
allotted the offender. So careful
of the condition of the land and
its products were the divinely inspired
laws of the Hebrews that they
provided every seven years a season
of rest, “the Sabbath of the land,”
when for a twelvemonth the fields
should not be ploughed nor the
vineyards pruned, neither any fruit
forced to grow and produce by artificial
means. It would take a volume
to develop this mysterious
superiority of the chosen people, as
regards even material civilization,
over every other contemporary nation
during fully two thousand years.
They saw whole systems of social
economy rise from barbarism, and
fade away into political dotage, or
disappear beneath the heel of conquest;
they watched nations live
and die, and drop out of the memory
of mankind as completely as Pharao’s
hosts were hidden by the waves
of the Red Sea, and yet they stood
firm and indestructible, with unchanged
laws, with fixed customs, a
people small in number, but great in
tradition, invincible as the sun,
immovable as a rock. And why?
Because their political existence and
their social system was founded on
truth, and controlled by religion.
The Hebrew nation was the one
holy and only true church of those
days. And for the same reasons
which gave the Jews that supernatural
vitality, Christianity is at this
day in the van of civilization. Everything
we have said of the one applies
to the other; the signs which we
noticed as such prominent features
of Jewish polity&mdash;division of orders,
fixed occupations, care for agriculture,
good faith, property and family
laws, individual and federal government&mdash;whence
have they come to us?
We say it unhesitatingly, from
Christianity. To put it into plainer
language, let us say, from the church,
and chiefly through the monastic
orders.</p>

<p>These armies of peaceful conquerors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
invaded the morasses and forests
of the North, and, carrying with
them all that made the Hebrew system
divine, planted that very system
in the midst of the barbarian hordes.
The monks were the first agriculturists,
the first mechanics, the first engineers,
of our modern civilization.
What need to tell again the story of
their giant labors and glorious success?
After teaching us how to
build our houses, to till our fields, to
protect our rights, to clothe our bodies,
they taught us how to beautify
our lives by art, and store our minds
with learning. They gave us cathedrals,
that we might know how glorious
was the God they taught; they
gave us Roman, Greek, and Hebrew
lore, that we might see how liberal
was the Master they served. The
laws under which all European nations
and their offshoots now live
were framed on the model of the
Canons of the Church, themselves
based on the Tables of the Mosaic
law; and the sciences, the literature,
and the arts, of which we in our pygmy
self-glorification are so proud,
have been painfully transmitted to
us by the patient labor of monastic
scholars. Christianity in the person
of these heroic pioneers has paved
the way for all the civilization we
can boast of, and those who seek to
divorce civilization from Christianity
thereby disown their very title-deeds.
Once blot the church out of the
map of the world, and civilization
will speedily follow. Thank God
that that, at least, is now impossible!</p>

<p>Having therefore inherited all that
made the Hebrew system the most
perfect approach to the ideal of the
Garden of Eden, Christianity stands
to-day in the position of the only
legitimate representative of true civilization.
For one thousand five
hundred years, Christianity meant
Catholicism, and to the reign of her
undisputed supremacy belongs every
important discovery, every material
progress, the world has ever made.
Why then, when we face to-day that
world which owes it to the church that
it is strong enough to face anything&mdash;do
we meet everywhere the reproach
of intolerance, of retrogression?</p>

<p>Is the reproach true to-day which
in the days of S. Columba was
false? Have we changed, has the
church changed? If not, where is
the fault?</p>

<p>It lies, as all human mistakes do, in
the confusion and perversion of terms.
The world in its aberration has turned
against its teacher, and wounded
itself with the weapons that only
a practised and steady hand may safely
wield. It has erected its own puny
tribunal at the foot of God’s throne,
and judged the Eternal from its own
point of view. If the childish madness
were not so sad in its results,
it would make one smile at its presumption.
But it has the power of
damning a human soul, and of frustrating
the work of God himself on
Calvary, so that we dare not smile
at its arrogance, how supremely
ridiculous soever it may be from a
merely philosophical point of view.
It is this aberration of the human
mind which for the last three centuries
has dubbed Christianity as retrograde.
When the Pope’s Syllabus made the
difference clear between true progress
and its infidel counterfeit, the
world cried out that he was retrograde.
“See” it said, “he condemns
the liberty of the press, the liberty
of association, the right of self-government,
the spread of education;
he would have heretics burnt at the
stake, and all Protestant sovereigns
deposed from their thrones.”</p>

<p>Was it so? We know that it was
not. We know that it was the <i>abuse</i>,
not the <i>use</i>, of these things which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
condemned, and that the denunciation
of error is a very different thing
from the extermination of that error’s
victims. We know this, and the
world too knew it, but it suited the
purpose of the world to say otherwise,
and to raise against us the cry
of intolerance, fanaticism. Well, be
it so; but who fashioned the languages
in which that cry is raised,
who taught the world the meaning
of such words as intolerance and
fanaticism, who led the way to the
contrivance without which the liberty
of the press could not exist?</p>

<p>Our civilization, it is true, is of a
different order from that now in
fashion. It is a civilization which
has no need of iron ships and monster
armies; it can subdue and humanize
by other methods than the
bullet and the shell. It tolerates all
and any customs that do not strike
at morality; it can adapt itself to
any nation, and make itself <i>all things
to all men</i>. It does not pin its faith
to the color of the skin, the fashion
of a garment, or any social conventionality;
it does not supersede individuality,
either personal or national,
but engrafts itself upon it and
makes it serve a higher purpose. It
does not address itself exclusively to
one branch of human development,
but cultivates them all, each in its
turn, making them subservient at
last to the spiritual interests of the
soul.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p class="pc1 reduct">A GLANCE FROM MR. SCHÖNINGER.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">None</span> but people of routine ever
used their prayer-books while F.
Chevreuse was reading or singing
Mass, and it was seldom that even
such people used them the first time
they heard him; for it was not enough
that those who assisted should unite
their intention with that of the priest,
and then pray their own prayers, recalled
now and then to the altar by
the sound of the bell: their whole
attention was riveted there from the
first.</p>

<p>That penetrating voice, which
enunciated every word with such exquisite
clearness, speaking rapidly
only because so earnest, was heard
throughout the church, and its vivid
emphasis gave new life to every
prayer of the service. When F.
Chevreuse said <i>Dominus vobiscum!</i>
one replied as a matter of course&mdash;would
as soon, indeed, have neglected
to answer his face-to-face greeting
on the street as this from the altar;
the <i>Orate, fratres</i>, compelled the listener
to pray; and, at the <i>Domine,
non sum dignus</i>, one felt confounded
and abashed.</p>

<p>Was it, then, you asked yourself,
the first time this priest had said
Mass, that he should stand so like a
man who sees a vision? No; F.
Chevreuse had been fifteen years a
priest. Had he, perhaps, an intellect
more high than the ordinary, or
a superior sanctity? No, again;
though a clearer mind or a nobler
Christian soul one would scarcely
wish to see. The peculiarity lay
chiefly, we should guess, in a large,
impassioned, and generous heart,
which, like a strong fountain for ever
tossing up its freshening tide, overflowed
his being, and made even the
driest facts bud and blossom perennially.
In that heart, nothing worthy
of life ever faded or grew old. Its
possessions were dowered with the
freshness of immortal youth.</p>

<p>Still, these gifts might have been
partially ineffectual if nature had not
added to them a sanguine temperament,
and the priceless blessing of
a body capable of enduring severe
and prolonged labor. F. Chevreuse
was spared that misery of a bright
intelligence and an active will for
ever pent and thwarted by physical
incompetence, the soul by its nature
constantly compelled to issue
mandates to the body, which the
body by its weakness is as inevitably
compelled to disobey. In that wide
brain of his, thoughts had ample
elbow-room, and could range themselves
without crowding or confusion;
and the broad shoulders and
deep chest showed with what full
breathing the flame of life was fanned.
His mind was always working,
yet there was no sign of a feverish
head; the eyes were steady, and the
close-cut gray hair grew so thick as
to form a crown.</p>

<p>For the rest, let his life speak.
We respect the privacy of such a
soul; and, though we would fain
show him real and admirable, we
sketch F. Chevreuse with a shy pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>The church of S. John was a new
and unfinished one on Church Street.
This street ran east and west, parallel
with the Cocheco, and half-way
up the South Hill, which here sloped
so abruptly that the buildings on the
lower side had one more story at the
rear than in front, and those on the
upper side one more story in front
than at the rear. In consequence
of this deceptive appearance, those
who liked to put the best foot forward
preferred to live on the upper
side, though it doomed them to a
north light in their houses, while
those who thought more of comfort
than of display chose the other side
with a southward frontage.</p>

<p>The church was set back so as to
leave a square in front, and its entrance
was but four or five steps
above the street; but at the back a
large and well-lighted basement was
visible. The priest’s house stood
close to the street, on the eastern
side of this square, and so near that
between the back corner of its main
part and the front corner of the
church there was scarcely space for
two persons to stand abreast. This
narrow passage, screened by a yard
or so of iron railing, gave access to
a long flight of stairs that led to the
basements of the church and of the
house.</p>

<p>Seen from the front, this house
was a little, melancholy, rain-streaked,
wooden cottage, which might be regarded
as a blot upon the grandeur
of the church, or an admirable foil
for it, as one had a mind to think.
The door opened almost on the
sidewalk, and beside the door were
two dismal windows with the curtains
down. In the space above, another
curtained window was set between
the two sharp slants of the roof.
On the side opposite the church,
where a lane ran down to the next
street, the prospect was more cheering.
You saw there an L as wide
as the main building, though not so
deep, and projecting from it so as to
give another street door at the end
of a veranda, and allow space for
two windows at the rear of the house.
This L was Mrs. Chevreuse’s peculiar
domain, as the house was that
of the priest. Her sitting-room and
bedroom were here; and no one acquainted
with the customs of the place
ever came to the veranda door unless
they could claim an intimate
friendship with the priest’s mother.</p>

<p>The parlor with the two dismal front
windows beside the entrance was
used as a reception-room. Back of
that was the priest’s private sitting-room,
with two windows looking out
on the veranda, and one window
commanding the basement entrance
of the church, the pleasant green
space around it, and the flight of
stairs that led up to the street. F.
Chevreuse’s arm-chair and writing-table
always stood in this window,
and behind them was a door leading
into a little side-room containing a
strong desk where he kept papers
and money, and a sofa on which he
took an occasional nap.</p>

<p>Up-stairs were two sleeping-rooms;
down-stairs, as the hill sloped, the
kitchen, dining-room, and the two
rooms occupied by Jane, the cook,
and Andrew, the priest’s man. There
was space enough in the house, and
it had the charm of irregularity; but
from the street, as we have said, it
was a melancholy-looking structure.
F. Chevreuse, however, could not
have been better pleased with it had
it been a palace. Within, all was
comfort and love for him; and he
probably never looked at the outside.
The new church and his people
engrossed his thoughts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chevreuse was not so indifferent.
“It would not look well for me to
go up on a ladder, and paint the outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
walls,” she said to herself, her
only confidant in such matters; “but,
if it could be turned inside-out for
one day, I would quickly have it
looking less like an urchin with a
soiled face.”</p>

<p>No one could doubt this assertion
after having seen the interior of this
castle of the rueful countenance.
There she could go up on a ladder
without shocking any one, and from
basement to attic the place was as
fresh as a rose. But the nicety was
never intrusive. This lady’s house-keeping
perspective was admirably
arranged, and her point of view the
right one. Cleanliness and order
dwelt with her, not as tyrants, but
as good fairies who were visible only
when looked for. If you should
chance to think of it, you would observe
that everything which should
be polished shone like a mirror; that
the white was immaculate, the windows
clear, and the furniture well-placed.
You might recollect that
the door was never opened for you
by an untidy house-maid, and that
no odors from the kitchen ever saluted
your nostrils on entering, though
a bouquet on the stair-post sometimes
breathed a fragrant welcome.</p>

<p>Now, housekeepers know that the
observance of all these little details
of order and good taste involves a
great deal of care and labor; but
they sometimes forget that their
exquisite <i>ménage</i> loses its principal
charm when the care and labor are
made manifest. It cannot be denied
that the temptation is strong now
and then to let Cæsar know by what
pains we produce these apparently
simple results, which he takes as a
matter of course; but, when the
temptation is yielded to, the results
cease to be entirely pleasing. The
unhappy man becomes afraid to
walk on our carpets, to touch our
door-knobs, to sit in our chairs, eat
eggs with our spoons, lay his odious
pipe on our best table-cover, or tie
the curtains into a knot. The touching
confidence with which he was
wont to ask that an elaborate dinner
might be prepared for him in fifteen
minutes vanishes from his face like a
rainbow tint that leaves the cloud
behind. “A cold lunch will do,” he
tells you resignedly, and you detect
incipient dyspepsia in his countenance.
The free motions that seemed
to feel infinite space about them
are no more. The anxious hero
pulls his toga about him in the most
undignified and ungraceful manner,
lest it should upset a flower-pot or
a chair. In fine, the tormenting
gadfly of our neatness stings him up
and down his days, till he would fain
seek refuge and rest in disorder.</p>

<p>Mother Chevreuse knew all this
perfectly, and behaved herself in so
heroic a manner that her son never
suspected, what was quite true, that
the unnecessary steps he caused her
might make several miles a day.</p>

<p>One morning after early Mass,
toward the last of May, she seated
herself in the arm-chair by the window,
and watched for the priest to
come in from the church. This was
a part of her daily programme, and the
only time of day she ever occupied
what she called his throne. After
his breakfast, they did not meet, save
incidentally, till supper-time; for,
except when they had company,
F. Chevreuse dined alone. The
mother had perceived that, when they
dined together, there had been a
struggle between the sense of duty
and courtesy which made him wish
to entertain her, and the abstraction
he naturally felt in the midst of the
cares and labors of the day, and,
ever on the watch lest she should in
any way intrude on his vocation,
had herself made this arrangement.
The fact that he did not oppose it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
was a sufficient proof that it was
agreeable to him.</p>

<p>This mother was the softer type of
her son, as though what you would
carve in granite you should first
mould in wax. There was the same
compact form, telling of health,
strength, and activity, the same clear
eyes, the same thick gray hair
crowning a forehead more wide than
high. Their expressions differed as
their circumstances did; cheerfulness
and good sense were common
to both; but, where the priest was
authoritative, the woman was dignified.</p>

<p>Presently her face brightened, for
the fold of a black robe showed
some one standing just inside the
chapel door, and the next moment
F. Chevreuse appeared, his hands
clasped behind him, his face bent
thoughtfully downward. Seeing him
thus for the first time, you are surprised
to find him only medium
height. At the altar, he had appeared
tall. You might wonder, too, what
great beauty his admirers found in
him. But scarcely had the doubt
formed itself in your mind, before it
was triumphantly answered. The
priest’s first step was into a shadow,
his second into sunlight; and, as that
light smote him, he lifted his head
quickly, and a smile broke over his
face. Wheeling about, he fronted
the east. The river-courses had
hollowed out a deep ravine between
him and the sunrise, and the tide of
glory flowed in and filled that from
rim to rim, and curled over the green
hills like wine-froth over a beaker.
He stood gazing, smiling and undazzled,
his face illuminated from
within as from without. It might
be said of F. Chevreuse, as it was of
William Blake, that, when the sun rose
“he did not see a round, fiery disk
somewhat like a guinea, but an innumerable
company of the heavenly
hosts crying, ‘Holy, holy, holy is the
Lord God Almighty!’”</p>

<p>The mother watched, but did not
interrupt him. She knew well that
such moments were fruitful, and that
he was storing away in his mind the
precious vintage of that spring morning
to bring it forth again at some
future time fragrant with the bouquet
of a spiritual significance. “Glimpses
of God,” she called such moods.</p>

<p>He threw his head back, and, with
a swift glance, took in the whole
scene; the fleckless blue overhead, the
closely gathered city beneath, the
lights and shades that played in the
dewy greensward at his feet, and,
turning about, his mother’s loving
face&mdash;a fit climax for the morning.</p>

<p>“<i>Bon jour, Mère Chevreuse!</i>” he
called out, touching his <i>barrette</i>.</p>

<p>As he disappeared into the house,
Mrs. Chevreuse went into her own
sitting-room, which opened from his,
and gave a last glance at the table
prepared for his breakfast. The
preparation was not elaborate. A
little stand by the eastern window
held a pitcher of milk, a bowl and
spoon, and a napkin; and Jane,
following the priest up-stairs, added
a dish of oatmeal pudding.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse walked briskly
through the entry, and threw the
street door wide open, then came
back singing, “Lift up your heads,
O ye gates, and the King of glory
shall come in!” and continued, as
he entered the room, his voice hardly
settled from song to speech, “What
created things are more like the King
of glory than light and air? They
are as his glance and his breath.”</p>

<p>The look that met his was sympathizing,
but the words that replied
were scarcely an answer to his question.
“Your breakfast is cooling,
F. Chevreuse,” she said.</p>

<p>He took no heed, but, clasping his
hands behind him, walked to and fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
with a step that showed flying would
have been the more congenial motion.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he exclaimed, “the mysteries
of human nature are as inscrutable
as the mysteries of God. Would
the angels believe, if they had not seen,
that a Mass has been said this morning
here in the midst of a crowded
city, with only a score or so of persons
to assist? Why was not the
church thronged with worshippers,
and thousands pressing outside to
kiss the foundation-stones? When
I turned with the <i>Ecce Agnus Dei</i>,
why did not all present fall with their
faces to the floor? And when Miss
Honora Pembroke walked away
from the communion-railing, why did
not every one look at her with wonder
and admiration?&mdash;the woman
who bore her God in her bosom!
And just now, when the sun rose”&mdash;he
stopped and looked at his mother
with a combative air&mdash;“why did not
the people look up and hail it as
the signet of the Almighty?”</p>

<p>Mother Chevreuse smiled pleasantly.
She was used to being set up as
a target for these unanswerable questions,
especially in the morning, at
which time the priest was likely to
be, as Jane expressed it, “rather
high in his mind.”</p>

<p>“If you could take your breakfast,
my son,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“Breakfast!” He glanced with a
look of aversion at the table that
held his frugal meal, considered a
moment, recognized the propriety of
its existence, finally seated himself
in his place, and began to eat with a
very good appetite. “You were
quite right, my lady,” he remarked;
“the sunshine was drinking my milk
all up. What thirsty creatures they
are, those beams!”</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that F.
Chevreuse was so ascetical as never
to eat except when urged to do so.
On the contrary, he took good care
to keep up the health and strength
necessary for the performance of his
multiform duties as the only priest in
a large parish, and he used a wise
discrimination in allowing others to
fast. “Some fasting is almost as bad
as feasting,” he used to say. “Besides
injuring the health, it clogs the
soul. You look down upon eating
when you have dined moderately;
but, when you have fasted immoderately,
the idea of dinner is elevated
till it becomes a constellation. I do
not wish to starve, till, when I kneel
down and raise my eyes, I can think
of nothing but roast beef. Asceticism
is not an end, but a means.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said presently, laying
down his spoon, “why is it that
the oatmeal and milk I get at home
are better than that I find anywhere
else?”</p>

<p>“Children always think the food
they get at home better than what
they get abroad,” she replied tranquilly.</p>

<p>Why should she tell him that what
he called milk was cream, and that
the making of that “stirabout” was
a fine-art, which had been taught
Jane line upon line, and precept upon
precept, till every grain dropped
according to rule, and the motion of
the pudding spoon was as exact as
a sonnet? Instead of being pleased,
he would have been disturbed to
know that so much pains had been
taken for him.</p>

<p>“I like no earthly comfort that
has cost any one much trouble or
pain,” he would say. Like most
persons who have been spared the
petty cares of life, he did not know
that in this discordant world there is
no earthly comfort to any one which
is not a pain to some other.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the priest went
promptly about his business; and
Mrs. Chevreuse, shutting the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
between their rooms, brought her
work-basket to the stand where the
tray had been, and seated herself to
mend a rent in a <i>soutane</i>.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant room, with its
one window toward the church,
and an opposite one looking over
the city and the distant hills, and
most enticingly comfortable, with
deep chairs, convenient tables, and
tiny stands always within reach,
and an open fireplace which was
seldom, save at mid-summer, without
its little glimmer of fire at some time
of day. And even then, if the day
was chilly or overcast, the fact that it
was mid-summer did not prevent the
kindling of Mother Chevreuse’s beltane
flame. From this room and
the bedroom behind it could be
heard on still nights the dashing of
the Cocheco among its rocks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chevreuse worked and
thought. The sunbeams sparkled on
the scissors, needles, bodkins, and
whatever bright thing it could find in
her work-basket, on her eyeglasses
and thimble, on the smooth-worn
gold of her wedding-ring, and the
tiny needle weaving deftly to and fro
in an almost invisible darn, of which
the lady was not a little proud. Her
mind wove, too; not those flimsy
fancies of youth so like spider’s webs
upon the grass, that glitter only when
the morning dew is on them: the
threads of her dream-tapestry ended
in heaven, though begun on earth,
and their severance could only
change hope into fruition. And all
the time, while hand and heart slipped
to and fro, the lady was aware
of everything that went on in the
house. She heard Andrew come
into the next room with the morning
mail, heard the sound of voices while
he received his orders for the day,
heard him go clumping down-stairs,
and out through the kitchen into the
chapel. Presently the clumping resounded
outside, and, glancing across
the room, she saw the old man standing
on the basement stairs, his head on
a level with her window, looking at
her across the space that intervened,
and gesticulating, with a twinkling
candlestick in each hand.</p>

<p>Mother Chevreuse, still holding her
work, went and threw the sash up.</p>

<p>“I think, madame, begging your
pardon, that I can clean these just
as well as you can,” says Andrew,
with a very positive nod and a little
shake that set all the glass drops
twinkling and tinkling.</p>

<p>“Do you, Andrew?” returned madame
pleasantly. “Very well, then,
you can clean them, and save me the
trouble. But don’t forget to rub all
the whiting out of the creases.”</p>

<p>Andrew changed countenance as
he turned slowly about to descend
the stairs. Mrs. Chevreuse had been
gradually taking the care of the altar
from his rather careless hands, and
this had been his diplomatic way of
escaping the candlestick cleaning of
that day without asking her to do it.
He hobbled down-stairs again discomfited,
and the lady went smiling
back to her work.</p>

<p>“It is all very well for Sharp’s
rifles,” she remarked, threading her
needle; “but I don’t like being fired
at in that spiral manner.”</p>

<p>Still weaving again with hand and
heart, she heard Jane going about,
like a neat household machine doing
everything in its exact time and
place, severe on interruption, merciless
on mud or dust, ever ready to
have a skirmish on these grounds with
Andrew; she heard the rattle of paper
from the next room, as letters and
parcels were opened, the scratching
of F. Chevreuse’s quill as he wrote
answers to one or two correspondents,
or made up accounts, and the little
tap with which he pressed the stamp
upon the letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>How peaceful and sweet her life
was, all she loved within reach, all
she hoped for so sure! She breathed a
sigh of thanksgiving, then dropped
her work and listened; for the priest
was preparing to go out. Every
morning was spent by him in collecting
for his church. He had found in
Crichton a thousand or more practical
Catholics, with one shabby old
chapel to worship in, and nearly as
many nominal Catholics who did not
worship at all; and in three years,
with scarcely any capital to begin
with besides faith, he had raised and
nearly finished a large and beautiful
church, and gathered into it the
greater part of the wanderers.</p>

<p>“Be prudent, my son!” the mother
had warned him when he began what
seemed so venturesome an enterprise.</p>

<p>“I am so,” he replied, with decision.
“It would be the height of
imprudence to leave these people any
longer straying like lost sheep. When
the Master of the universe commands
that a house be built for him, is it for
me to fear he will not be able to pay
for it?”</p>

<p>She said no more. Mme. Chevreuse
always remembered to distinguish
between the son and the priest,
and was never more proud of her
motherhood than when her natural
authority was confronted by the
supernatural authority of her child.
But she always sighed when he started
on a collecting-tour, for his faith
had to be supplemented by hard
work, and often he came back worn
with fatigue, and depressed by the
sights of poverty, sorrow, and sin he
had witnessed.</p>

<p>All had gone well with the church,
however&mdash;so well that a new enterprise
had been added, and a convent
school was just making its small beginning
in Crichton.</p>

<p>“Is madame visible?” asked a
voice smothered against the door.</p>

<p>“<i>Entrez!</i>” she answered gaily;
and the priest put his head in.</p>

<p>“Say a little prayer to S. Joseph
for F. Chevreuse to-day,” he said;
“for he is collecting for the great
note.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” She looked anxiously at
him, and met a reassuring smile in
return.</p>

<p>“Never fear, mother!” he said
cheerfully. “Do not all the houses
and lands belong to God?”</p>

<p>“Certainly!” she answered, but
sighed to herself as he went away:
“it is very true they all belong to
God, but I’m afraid the devil has
some very heavy mortgages on
them.”</p>

<p>Later in the day, Miss Ferrier
called for Mrs. Chevreuse to go out
and visit the sisters at the new convent.
“I have taken all I could
think of this morning,” she said, and
enumerated various useful articles.
“I suppose they want nearly everything.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chevreuse commended her
liberality. “But I am glad you did
not think of cordage,” she added;
“for that is the very thing I did remember.”</p>

<p>She opened a large basket, and
laughingly displayed a collection of
ropes and cords varying from coils
of clothes-line and curtain-cord to
balls of fine pink twine. “Jane’s
clothes-line gave out yesterday,” she
said, “and that made me think of
this.”</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier gave a little shiver
and shrug. “It is very nice and
useful, I know; but ropes always remind
me of hanging.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” returned the lady,
tying on her bonnet: “that is their
vocation.”</p>

<p>“But hanging is such a dreadful
punishment!” And the young woman
shivered again.</p>

<p>“Why, my pictures seem to enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
it,” Mrs. Chevreuse replied, persistently
cheerful.</p>

<p>“Now, really, madame&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Now, really, mademoiselle,” was
the laughing interruption, “what has
put your thoughts on such a track
this morning? If you want my opinion
on the subject, I cannot give it,
for I have none. All I can say is
that, if I thought any one were destined
to kill me, I would instantly
write and sign a petition for his pardon,
and leave it to be presented to
the governor and council at the proper
time. Think of something pleasant.
I am ready now. We will go
out through the house.”</p>

<p>She locked the veranda door, and
put the key in her pocket. “I have
only to give Jane an order. Jane!”
she called, leaning out the window.</p>

<p>A head appeared from the kitchen
window beneath, and the mistress
gave her order down the outside of
the house. “It saves so much going
up and down stairs for two old women,”
she explained. “Now, my
dear.”</p>

<p>They went into the priest’s sitting-room,
and again the door was locked
behind them, and the key this time
hung on a nail over the writing-table.
“Wait a moment,” said madame
then, and began picking up bits of
paper scattered about the room. The
priest had torn up a letter, and absently
dropped the fragments on the
carpet instead of into the waste-basket,
and a breeze had been playing
with them.</p>

<p>“How provoking men are,” remarked
Miss Ferrier, stooping for a
fragment which a puff of air instantly
caught away from her.</p>

<p>“Are they?” asked Mrs. Chevreuse
quietly. “I do not know, I have so
little to do with them. Most people
are provoking sometimes, I dare say.”</p>

<p>Having made a second ineffectual
dive for the strip of paper, the young
woman had not patience enough left
to bear so cool an evasion. “F.
Chevreuse deserves a scolding for
strewing this about,” she said.</p>

<p>The mother glanced at her with
that sort of surprise which is more
disconcerting than anger. Miss
Ferrier blushed, but would not be so
silenced.</p>

<p>“If you should oblige him to pick
them up once,” she continued, “that
would cure him.”</p>

<p>“Oblige him!” repeated the mother
with a more emphasized coldness.
“I never oblige F. Chevreuse to do
anything. I should not dream of
calling his attention to such a trifle.
He has higher affairs on his mind.
Now we will go.”</p>

<p>Their drive took them through the
town by its longest avenue, Main
Street, which followed the Saranac
half-way to its source. School children
in Crichton looked on Main
Street as their meridian of longitude,
and were under the impression that
it reached from pole to pole. It
crossed the Cocheco by the central
one of three parallel bridges, climbed
straight up the steep North Height,
and stretched out into the country.
The convent grounds were on the
west bank of the Saranac, twenty
acres of rough land, roughly enclosed,
with an old tumble-down house
that had been a tavern in the early
days of Crichton. It was a desolate-looking
place, with not a tree nor
flower to be seen, but needed only
time and labor to become a little
Eden.</p>

<p>In the eyes of Sister Cecilia it was
even now an Eden. Her ardent
and generous nature, made still
brighter by a beautiful Christian enthusiasm,
saw in advance the blossom
and fruit of unplanted trees, and
seeds yet in the paper. Full of delight
to her was all this planning and
labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>She was out-doors when the carriage
drove up, in earnest consultation
with two workmen, directing
the laying out of the kitchen-garden,
and, recognizing her visitors, hastened
toward them with a cordial welcome.
Sister Cecilia was a little
over forty years of age, tall and
graceful, and had one of those sunny
faces that show heaven is already
begun in the heart. When she smiled,
the sparkling of her deep-blue
eyes betrayed mirth and humor.</p>

<p>“Dread the labor?” she exclaimed,
in answer to a question from Miss
Ferrier. “Indeed not! I was so
charmed with the idea of coming to
this wild place that I had a scruple
about it, and was almost afraid I
ought not to be indulged. It is
always delightful to begin at the beginning,
and see the effect of your
work.”</p>

<p>She led them about the place and
told her plans. Here a grove was
to be planted, there the path would
wind, vines would be trained against
this stone wall.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see any stone wall,”
protested Miss Ferrier.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia laughed. “I see it
distinctly, and so will you next year.
There are piles of stones on the land
which will save us a good deal
of money; and we are very likely to
have some work done for nothing.
Do you know how kind the laborers
are to us? Twenty men have offered
to do each a day’s work in our
garden free of charge. Those are
two of them. Now, here we are
going to have a large arbor covered
with honeysuckle and roses. It must
be closed on the east side, because
there will be a river-road outside the
wall some day, and we should be
visible from it. But the south side
will be all open, so we can sit under
the roses and look down that beautiful
river and over all the city. You
see the knoll was made on purpose
for an arbor.”</p>

<p>As they went into the house, a
slender shape glided past in the dusk
of the further entry. The light from
a roof window, shining down the
stairs, revealed a face like a lily
drooped a little sidewise, a wealth
of brown hair gathered back, and a
sweet, shy smile. It was as though
some one had carried a lighted
waxen taper through the shadows
where she disappeared.</p>

<p>“It is Anita!” exclaimed Miss
Ferrier, stopping on the threshold of
the parlor. “Why did she not come
to us?”</p>

<p>“That dear Anita!” said the sister.
“She has a piano lesson to give at
this hour, and would not dream of
turning aside from the shortest road
to the music-room. If you were her
own mother, Mme. Chevreuse, she
would not come to you without permission.
Yet such a tender, loving
creature I never knew before. Obedience
is the law of her life. Next
spring she will begin her novitiate.”</p>

<p>The house was looked over, the
other sisters seen, and the offerings
brought them duly presented and
acknowledged; then the two ladies
started for home.</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier was rather silent when
they were alone. She had not forgotten
the reproof of the morning,
and she felt aggrieved by it. Mrs.
Chevreuse had known that she was
but jesting, and might have been a
little less touchy, she thought. What
was the matter that almost every one
was finding fault with her lately?
Her mother accused her of being
cross and captious, her lover found
her exacting, and Mrs. Gerald had
thought her too assuming on one occasion,
and yet all she was conscious
of was a blind feeling of loss&mdash;some
such sense as deep-buried roots
may have when the sky grows dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
over the tree above. Little things
that once would have passed by like
the idle wind now had power to
make her shrink, as the lightest touch
will hurt a sore; and trifles that had
once given her pleasure now fell
dead and flat. The time had been
when the mere driving through the
city in her showy carriage had elated
her, when she had sat in delighted
consciousness of the satin cushions,
the glittering harness and wheels,
and even of the band on the coachman’s
hat and the capes that fluttered
from his shoulders. Now they
sometimes gave her a feeling of weary
disgust, and she assured herself
that she knew not why. If any suspicion
glanced across her mind that
a worm was eating into the very
centre of her rose of life, and the
outer petals withered merely because
the heart was withering, she shut her
eyes to it, and kept seeking here
and there for comfort, but found
none. Honora was the only person
who ever really soothed her;
and, for some reason, or for no reason,
even Honora’s soothing now
and then held a sting that was keenly
felt.</p>

<p>“Is it possible she is resenting my
reproof?” thought Mrs. Chevreuse,
and exerted herself to be pleasant
and friendly, but without much success.
Miss Ferrier’s affected gaiety
was gone, and she had no disposition
to resume it.</p>

<p>“She is not so good-tempered as I
believed,” the priest’s mother thought
when they parted, with one of those
unjust judgments which the good
form quite as often as the bad.</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier drove on homeward.
She had no need to tell the coachman
which way to drive, nor how,
for he knew perfectly well that he
was to make his horses prance slowly
through Bank Street, where, in a certain
insurance office up one flight of
a granite building, Mr. Lawrence
Gerald bit his nails and fumed over
a clerk’s desk, and half attended to
his business while inwardly protesting
against what he called his misfortunes.
Perhaps his desk faced
the window, or maybe his companions
were good enough to call his
attention to it; for it seldom happened
that Miss Ferrier, glancing up,
did not see him waiting to bow
to her. He did not love the girl,
but he felt a trivial pride in contemplating
the evidences of that wealth
which was one day to be his unless
he should change his mind. He
sometimes admitted the possibility
of the latter alternative.</p>

<p>To-day he was not at the window;
but his lady-love had hardly time to
be conscious of disappointment, when
she saw him lounging in the doorway
down-stairs. He came listlessly
out as the carriage drew up, and at
the same moment Miss Lily Carthusen
appeared from a shop near by,
and joined them. This young lady
took a good deal of exercise in the
open air, and might be met almost
any time, and always with the latest
news to tell.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you both,” she
said, in her sprightliest manner.
“That dreadful organist of yours has
put his wrist out of joint, and cannot
play again for a month or two. Isn’t
it delightful?” She laughed elfishly.
“Haven’t you heard of it? Oh!
yes; it is true. It happened this
morning when he came down the
dark stairway in his boarding-house.
He tumbled against the dear old
balusters, and put his wrist out. I
never before knew the good of
dark stairways.”</p>

<p>“Why, Lily! aren’t you ashamed?”
remonstrated Miss Ferrier, smiling
faintly.</p>

<p>“Do you think I ought to be
ashamed?” inquired Miss Lily, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
an ingenuous expression in her large,
light-blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes; I do,” replied Miss Ferrier,
much edified.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I won’t,” was the
satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for Mr. Glover,”
Miss Ferrier remarked gravely.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear mademoiselle,
please don’t be so crushingly good!”
cried the other. “You know perfectly
well that he plays execrably,
and spoils the singing of your beautiful
choir; and you know that you
would be perfectly delighted if F.
Chevreuse would pension him off.
Don’t try to look grieved, for you
can’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t pretend to be a saint,
Miss Carthusen,” said Annette, dropping
her eyes.</p>

<p>“And I don’t pretend to be a
sinner,” was the mocking retort.</p>

<p>Mr. Gerald smiled at this little
duel, as men are wont to smile at
such scenes. It did not hurt him,
and it did amuse him.</p>

<p>“But the best part of the business
is that F. Chevreuse has asked Mr.
Schöninger to play in his stead,”
pursued the news-bringer. “He has
written a note requesting him to call
there this evening.”</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier drew her shawl about
her, and leaned back against the
cushions. She had an air of dismissing
the subject and the company
which, not being either rude or
affected, was so near being stately
that Mr. Gerald was pleased with it,
and, to reward her, begged an invitation
to lunch.</p>

<p>“I had just come out for my daily
sandwich,” he said; “but if you will
take pity on me&mdash;“</p>

<p>She smilingly made room for him
by her side, and drove off full of
delight.</p>

<p>The afternoon waned, and, as
evening approached, Mrs. Chevreuse
sat in her own room again, waiting
for the priest to come home. She
had visited her sick and poor, looked
to her household affairs, stepped into
the church to arrange some fresh
flowers, and see that the candlesticks
shone with spotless brilliancy, and
was now trying to interest herself in
a book while she waited. But it was
hard to fix her attention; it constantly
wandered from the page.
Jane had heard and told her of the
accident to their organist, and the
rumor that Mr. Schöninger was
to take his place; but had not
told the news by any means with
the glee of a Lily Carthusen. On
the contrary, it had seemed to her
mind an almost incredible horror
that a Jew was to take any part in a
service performed before the altar
whereon the Lord of heaven was
enthroned. To Jane’s mind, every
Jew was a Judas. That he could
be moral, that he could adore
his Creator and pray earnestly
for forgiveness of his sins, she
did not for an instant believe. The
worst criminal, if nominally a Catholic,
was in her eyes infinitely preferable
to the best Jew in the world.</p>

<p>“Andrew declared it was so, madame,
and that he carried a note to
that Mr. Schöninger before dinner,”
she said, concluding her lamentation;
“but nothing will make me believe it
till I hear F. Chevreuse say so with
his own mouth.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, don’t distress yourself
about it, Jane,” her mistress replied
soothingly. “Perhaps it is a mistake;
but, if it is not, you may be sure
that F. Chevreuse knows best. He
always has good reasons for what he
does. Besides, we must be charitable.
Who knows but the services
of the church and our prayers might,
by the blessing of God, convert this
man.”</p>

<p>“Convert a rattlesnake!” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
Jane, too much excited to be respectful.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Chevreuse, though she
had spoken soothingly to her subordinate,
was not herself altogether
satisfied. She was a woman of large
mind and heart; yet, if any one people
in the world came last in her regard,
it was the Jewish people. Moreover,
she had seen Mr. Schöninger but
once, and then at an unfortunate moment
when something had occurred
to draw that strange blank look over
his face. The impression left on her
mind was an unpleasant one that
there was something dark and secret
in the man.</p>

<p>“Of course it will all be right,” she
said to herself, annoyed that she
should feel disturbed for such a cause.
“I am foolish to think of it.”</p>

<p>The street door was opened and
left wide, after F. Chevreuse’s fashion,
and she heard his quick, light step
in the entry. Dropping her book,
she smiled involuntarily at the sound.
How sweet to a woman is this nightly
coming home of father, son, or husband!
He came in, went to the
inner room, and opened and closed
his desk, then returned to the sitting-room,
threw up the corner window,
from which he could see into her
apartment, and seated himself in his
arm-chair, leaning forward as he did
so to bow a smiling recognition across
to her. His day’s work was as nearly
over as it could be. In the morning,
he must go out to meet his duties; in
the evening, they must seek him.
The hour for their social life had
come; and though subject to constant
interruptions, so that scarcely
ten minutes at a time were left them
for confidential intercourse, they were
free to snatch what they could get.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chevreuse put her book
away, and opened the door between
the two sitting-rooms. “Father,”
she said immediately, “is it true that
you are going to have that Jew play
the organ at S. John’s?”</p>

<p>The priest rose hastily, and his
mother’s foot was arrested on the
threshold; for just opposite her,
coming into the room from the entry,
was Miss Lily Carthusen, leading a
little girl by the hand, and followed
by “that Jew”; while, in wrathful
perspective, like a thunder-head on
the horizon, gloomed the face of
Jane, the servant-woman.</p>

<p>The silence was only for the space
of a lightning-flash, and the flash
was not wanting; it shot across the
room from a pair of eyes that looked
as though they might sear to ashes
what they gazed upon in anger.
The next moment, the eyes drooped,
and their owner was bowing to F.
Chevreuse.</p>

<p>Miss Carthusen was perfectly self-possessed
and voluble, seeming to
have heard nothing. “This little
wilful girl would come with Mr.
Schöninger, madame,” she said;
“and, as he is not going back, I was
obliged to come and see her home
again safely.”</p>

<p>The truth was that Miss Lily, who
boarded in the same house with the
gentleman, had encouraged the child
to come, in order that she might
accompany her.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse had blushed slightly
but he showed no other embarrassment.
It was the first time that
Mr. Schöninger had entered his
house, and he welcomed him with a
more marked cordiality, perhaps, on
account of the unfortunate speech
which had greeted his coming.</p>

<p>“You are welcome, sir! I thank
you for taking the trouble to come
to me. It was my place to call on
you, but my engagements left me no
time. Allow me to present you to
my mother, Mme. Chevreuse.”</p>

<p>“My mother” had probably never
been placed in so disagreeable a position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
but her behavior was admirable.
The man she had involuntarily
insulted was forced to admit
that nothing could be more perfect
than the respectful courtesy of her
salutation, which maintained with
dignified sincerity the distance she
really felt, while it expressed her regret
at having intruded that feeling
on him.</p>

<p>“Yet they talk of charity!” he
thought; and the lady did not miss
a slight curl of the lip which was not
hidden by his profound obeisance.</p>

<p>The introduction over, she left Mr.
Schöninger to the priest, and took
refuge with his little friend, since she
could not with propriety leave the
room. The young lady was not
agreeable to her. Mme. Chevreuse
had that pure honesty and good
sense which looks with clear regards
through a murky and dissimulating
nature; for, after all, it is the deceitful
who are most frequently duped.</p>

<p>Miss Carthusen went flitting about
the room, making herself quite at
home. She selected a rosebud from
a bouquet on the mantelpiece, and
fastened it in madame’s gray hair
with her fingers as light as snowflakes;
she daintily abstracted the
glasses the lady held, and put them
on over her own large pale eyes.
“Glasses always squeeze my eyelashes,”
she said; “not that they are
so very long, though, at least, they
are not so long as Bettine von
Arnim’s little goose-girl’s. Hers were
two inches long; and the other girls
laughed at them, so that she went
away by herself and cried. Perhaps,
beyond a certain point, eyelashes are
like endurance, and cease to be a
virtue. Who is it tells of a young
lady whose long lashes gave her an
overdressed appearance in the morning,
so that one felt as though she
ought to have a shorter set to come
down to breakfast in?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chevreuse observed with interest
the striking difference between
the two men who sat near her talking,
both, as any one could see, strong
and fiery natures, yet so unlike in
temper and manner. The priest was
electrical and demonstrative; he
uttered the thought that rose in his
mind; he was a man to move the
crowd, and carry all before him. The
ardor of the other was the steady
glow of the burning coal that may
be hidden in darkness, and he shrank
with fastidious pride and distrust from
any revelation of the deeper feelings
of his heart, and held in check even
his passing emotions. He would
have said, with that Marquis de
Noailles, quoted by Liszt: <i>Qu’il n’y a
guère moyen de causer de quoi que ce
soit, avec qui que ce soit</i>; and, doubtless,
he had found it so.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse had explained his
wishes: their organist was disabled,
and they had no one capable of
taking his place. If Mr. Schöninger
would consent to take charge of
their singing, he would consider it a
great favor.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger had no engagement
which would prevent his doing
so, and it need not be looked on at
all as a favor, but a mere matter of
business. His profession was music.</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse would insist on feeling
obliged, although he would waive
the pleasure of expressing that feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger intimated that it
was perhaps desirable he should
meet the choir an hour before the
evening service.</p>

<p>The priest had been about to
make the same suggestion, and,
since the time was so near, would be
very happy to have his visitor take
supper with him.</p>

<p>The visitor thanked him, but had
just dined.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
and to the point, nor more utterly
stiff and frozen, than this dialogue
was. F. Chevreuse shivered, and
called little Rose&mdash;Rosebud, they
named her&mdash;to him.</p>

<p>The child went with a most captivating
mingling of shyness and
obedience in her air, walking a little
from side to side, as a ship beats
against the wind, making way in spite
of fears. Her red cheeks growing
redder, a tremor struggling with a
smile on her small mouth, the intrepid
little blossom allowed herself to be
lifted to the stranger’s knees, her
eyes seeking her friend’s for courage
and strength.</p>

<p>Mr. Schöninger smiled on his
favorite with a tenderness which gave
his face a new character, and watched
curiously while the priest reassured
and petted her till he won her
attention to himself. His own experience
and the traditions of his people
had taught him to look on the
Catholic Church as his most deadly
antagonist; yet now, in spite of all,
his heart relented and warmed a
little to one of her ministers. He
knew better than to take an apparent
love for children as any proof of
goodness&mdash;some of the worst persons
he had ever known were excessively
fond of them&mdash;yet it looked amiable
in an honest person, and F. Chevreuse’s
manner was particularly pleasant
and winning.</p>

<p>Embarrassed by the notice bestowed
on her by all, yet, with a premature
address, seeking to hide that
embarrassment, the child glanced
about the room in search of some
diversion. Her eyes were caught
by a picture of the Madonna.</p>

<p>“Oh! who is that pretty lady with
a wedding-ring round her head?”
she cried out.</p>

<p>“She,” said F. Chevreuse, “is a
sweet and holy Jewish lady whom
we all love.”</p>

<p>The little girl glanced apprehensively
at her friend&mdash;perhaps she had
been told never to speak the word
Jew in his presence&mdash;and saw a
quick light flicker in his eyes. He was
looking keenly at the priest, as if
trying to fathom his intention. Was
the man determined to win him in spite
of his coldness? Was it his way of
making proselytes, this fascinating
delicacy and tenderness? He did
not wish to like F. Chevreuse; yet
what could he do in the presence of
that radiant charity?</p>

<p>“I think our business is done, sir,”
he said, rising.</p>

<p>The priest became matter-of-fact
at once.</p>

<p>“It is not necessary for me to
make any suggestions to your good
taste,” he said; “but I may be permitted
to remark that our service is
not merely æsthetic, but has a vital
meaning, and I would like the music
to be conducted earnestly.”</p>

<p>“I shall make it as earnest as your
composers with allow, sir,” the musician
replied, with a slightly mocking
smile.</p>

<p>“My composers!” exclaimed the
priest, laughing. “I repudiate them.
Was it one of my composers who wrote
the music of the <i>Stabat Mater</i>, and set
his voices pirouetting and waltzing
through the woes of the Queen of
sorrows? The world accuses Rossini
of showing in that his contempt
for Christianity. I would not say so
much. I believe he thought of nothing
but the rhythm and the vowel-sounds.”</p>

<p>“And was it one of my composers,”
the Jew retorted, “who set the
<i>Kyrie Eleison</i> I heard on passing
your church last Sunday to an air as
gay as any dance tune? If the
words had been in English instead
of Latin, it would have sounded
blasphemous.”</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse made a gesture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
resignation. “What can I do if
the musicians are not so pious as the
painters, if they will put the sound
in the statue, and the sense in the
pedestal? My only refuge is the
Gregorian, which nobody but saints
will tolerate. I am not a composer.”</p>

<p>The call was at an end, and the
visitors went.</p>

<p>As soon as they were in the street,
Miss Carthusen observed: “I notice
that F. Chevreuse adopts Paracelsus’
method of cure: he anoints with
fine ointment, not the wound, but the
sword that made the wound.”</p>

<p>She had been annoyed at the little
attention paid to herself in contrast
with the honor shown the priest’s
mother, and wished to find out if
Mr. Schöninger kept any resentment
toward Mme. Chevreuse. He felt
her inquisitive, unscrupulous eyes
searching his face in sidelong glances.</p>

<p>“The priest was very courteous
to me,” he replied calmly. “And I
should think that madame might be
a very agreeable person to those she
likes.”</p>

<p>The young woman instantly launched
into a glowing eulogy of the
priest’s mother, till her listener bit
his lips. He was not quite ready
to be altogether charmed with the
lady.</p>

<p>“And, <i>à propos</i> of medicine,” said
Miss Carthusen lightly, “it has been
revealed to me to-day who the first
homœopathist was.”</p>

<p>“Is it a secret?”</p>

<p>“It was Achilles,” she replied.
“Do you not remember that nothing
but Achilles’ spear healed the wound
that itself had made?”</p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, Mme.
Chevreuse turned to her son. “Need
I say how sorry I am?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tears were in her eyes. She was
touched to the heart that, though he
must have been deeply mortified, he
should still not have failed for a moment
to treat her with even more
than ordinary courtesy and affection,
as if to show their visitors that he
did not dream of reproving her.</p>

<p>“I knew that you felt worse about
it than I did, dear mother,” he said,
taking her hand. “And this will remind
us both that it is not enough
to be cautious in the expression of
our thoughts. We must allow no
uncharitable feeling to remain in our
hearts.”</p>

<p>“‘Murder will out,’” he added
more lightly, seeing her moved.
“And, after all, isn’t Mr. Schöninger
a fine fellow?”</p>

<p>Madame made no direct reply.
She could not yet be enthusiastic
about the Jew. “I think we should
have supper,” she said, and went
down to look after Jane.</p>

<p>“O madame! did you see the
look that man gave you?” cried the
girl.</p>

<p>“No matter about that,” the lady
said calmly. “It was unfortunate
that I should not have known he
was coming. You must be careful
to give some sign when visitors are
coming in, and not introduce them
in that noiseless way.”</p>

<p>Madame held, with the Duke of
Wellington, that it is not wise to accuse
one’s self to a servant. The
humility, instead of edifying, only
provokes to insubordination.</p>

<p>“I was coming down from the
chambers, and met them at the
street door, madame,” Jane made
haste to say; “and I thought you
would hear the steps.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Jane; it’s no matter.
I’m sure you do your duty faithfully.
And now we will have supper.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="c513" name="c513">CHURCH AND STATE IN GERMANY.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> new laws for the regulation
and adjustment of the relations between
church and state in Prussia,
for the establishment of what Prince
Bismarck calls a <i>modus vivendi</i> between
the power spiritual and the
power temporal&mdash;laws which have
won the approval of the liberal and
sectarian press in Europe and America&mdash;are
substantially as follows:</p>

<p>1. All Prussian citizens who wish
to receive ecclesiastical functions
must matriculate at the state university.
After matriculating, they
must attend the university course
for three years. On concluding their
ecclesiastical studies, they must pass
another state examination; that is
to say, at the university. <i>No candidate
can be admitted to the priesthood
unless he satisfy the state in this examination.</i></p>

<p>2. The creation of new (ecclesiastical)
seminaries, great or small, is
prohibited. The seminaries already
existing shall be placed under state
surveillance, and are forbidden to receive
new scholars.</p>

<p>3. The candidate for the priesthood
who is nominated by the bishop
must be approved of and installed
in his office by the president of
the province. The bishop who
nominates a candidate otherwise
than in accordance with the law,
shall be punished by a fine of from
750 francs to 3,750 francs ($150 to
$750). The candidate submitting
to such nomination shall be punished
by a fine of from 3 francs (75 cts.) to
375 francs.</p>

<p>4. Ecclesiastical disciplinary power
can only be exercised by ecclesiastical
authorities <i>of German nationality</i>.
The ecclesiastical functionaries who,
by exercise of their functions, transgress
the laws of the state or the
ordinances of the civil authority, may,
at the demand of that civil authority,
be deposed, if the maintaining of
their functions prove incompatible
with public order.</p>

<p>A single question may not be inappropriate
here: Why all this?
Why must all Prussian citizens who
wish to embrace the ecclesiastical
state matriculate at the university?
What special advantages are either
they or that undefined thing called
the state likely to derive from this
matriculation? Matriculation is a
very small thing at the best, and
Catholics do not object to it even in
a state university, as in London,
where they do not possess one of
their own. But why must ecclesiastical
students be compelled to pass
it? The matriculation examination
as it obtains at the London University
embraces a hodge-podge of study,
a great part of which is of no absolute
service to the clerical student in his
career. All the subjects are touched
upon more or less in his college
course; but he naturally devotes his
attention particularly to those which
relate more especially to his vocation.
And when the state forces a man
who is studying to be a priest to attend
a university course of three
years, it steps out of its province, and
commits a useless and tyrannical act.</p>

<p>As for the final examination at the
end of the course, S. Paul certainly
could never have passed it to the
satisfaction of the present Prussian
state&mdash;a man who taught such dangerous
doctrines as that Christ was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
“above all principality, and power,
and virtue, and dominion, and every
name that is named, not only in this
world, but also in that which is to
come.”</p>

<p>There is no need to pursue this
part of the subject further. It must
be plain to everybody that this provision
of the bill is simply aimed at
preventing candidates from aspiring
to the priesthood at all, and hindering
those who are perverse enough to aspire
from becoming priests&mdash;a view
which is strengthened by the clause
following.</p>

<p>The candidate for the priesthood
whom the bishop wishes to ordain
and appoint must first meet with the
approval of the president of the province,
and not only meet with his
approval, but be installed in his office
by him. That is to say, the candidate
must not be what the state would
call an ultramontane&mdash;in other words,
a Catholic; and ordination is practically
transferred, if that were possible,
from the bishop to the state. What
can the president of the province
possibly know about the candidate,
an utter stranger to him? Or how is
he to judge of his fitness or unfitness
for the divine vocation? Is the
president of the province for the
future to undergo a course of theology,
so as to be “up” in his duties?
But it is needless to pursue this inquiry.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, when he called his
apostles, never consulted Pilate or
Herod. He sought not men for the
ministry who were learned in the
wisdom of the schools: poor, ignorant
fishermen were the foolish ones
whom he chose to confound the wise
and convert a world. Humanly
speaking, and to human eyes, the Son
of Joseph the carpenter was himself
an ignorant man. There is no record
of his studying, as did S. Paul,
“at the feet of Gamaliel.” The
apostles asked no man’s permission
to preach; they consulted no powers
in “the imposition of hands”;
they carried on all the business of
the church, they ordained and excommunicated,
without ever consulting
the president of the province in
which they happened to be. Their
successors will continue to do the
same.</p>

<p>In military matters, for instance,
which are purely state affairs, the
interference of the president of the
province would be resented. Courts-martial
try offenders&mdash;the civil law
may not touch them, and no president
is ever called in to sanction
the appointments to the various
military grades. Why not? Simply
because, in plain words, it is
none of his business.</p>

<p>It seems foolish to examine this
theme so closely, so flagrant is the
violation of all common sense even,
not to speak of legal right. Nevertheless,
here is the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>,
an ultra-liberal organ&mdash;so <i>ultra</i>, indeed,
that it despises “commonplace
liberalism”&mdash;giving its hearty concurrence
to these measures, on the
ground that priests are out of date,
and the fittest judges of education
are men of the world, statesmen,
lawyers, and business men, who are
more clever, better educated, and
brisker in every way than the clergy&mdash;with
much more to the same
effect. Regarding its charge that
the clergy are less fitted to cope
with the question of education than
men of the world:</p>

<p>In the Catholic Church, the Society
of Jesus is the principal teaching
order of modern times. But
outside of it there are plenty of
teaching orders and societies&mdash;the
Benedictines and others&mdash;possessed
of excellent colleges and
schools. There are also the colleges
belonging to each diocese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
under the control of the respective
bishops. Moreover, all education
has come to us through the hands
of the clergy; and the Catholic writers
who have come out from Rome,
and Louvain, and other purely clerical
centres, even in these enlightened
days, might possibly stand the
trying test of comparison with the
writers on the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.
But not to wander into so wide a
field as this, the <i>Pall Mall</i> may be
referred to its own columns for a refutation
of at least a great part of
this charge.</p>

<p>Writing last year on the expulsion
of the Jesuits from Germany by the
same power which has framed these
laws for the education of the clergy,
and which, as it confesses, are “almost
enough to take one’s breath
away,” the same journal said: “One
of the most remarkable traits of the
Society of Jesus has always been
its literary productiveness. Wherever
its members went, no sooner had
they founded a home, a college, a
mission, then they began to write
books. The result has been a vast
literature, not theological alone,
though chiefly that, but embracing
almost every branch of knowledge.”</p>

<p>And of their work in the particular
profession which the <i>Pall Mall</i> itself
graces at present&mdash;there is no knowing
what it may not come to be in
the future if its principles are only
carried out&mdash;it said: “In Italy,
Germany, Holland, and Belgium, the
most trustworthy critics are of opinion
that there are no better-written
newspapers than those under Jesuit
control.”</p>

<p>This is only <i>en passant</i>; and, as it
is often more satisfactory to let those
outside of the church answer themselves,
here is the opinion of the
London <i>Spectator</i> upon this particular
point, given in direct answer to
the <i>Pall Mall</i>:</p>

<p>“Is an age of the world in which
few men know what is truth or
whether there be truth, one in which
you would ask statesmen to determine
its limits? We suspect that a
race of statesmen armed with such
powers as Prussia is now giving to
her officials would soon cease to show
their present temperance (!) and sobriety,
and grow into a caste of civilian
ecclesiastics of harder, drier,
and lower mould than any of the
ecclesiastics they had to put down....
To our minds, the absolutism
of the Vatican Council is a trifling
danger compared with the growing
absolutism of the democratic temper
which is now being pushed into almost
every department of human
conduct.”</p>

<p>On the larger question of the dangers
of modern universities, the opinion
of one of the keenest of living
English statesmen was given in unmistakable
language at the annual
meeting of the Church Congress last
year at Leeds. The Marquis of Salisbury
is quite as true an Englishman
as any writer on the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i>, and his words may be considered
to possess at least equal
weight with those of the distinguished
journal mentioned.</p>

<p>Referring more immediately to the
abolition of the “Test Acts,” by
which the state had hitherto guaranteed
to overlook and prevent the
teaching of infidelity, he said: “All
hindrance to the teaching of infidelity
has been taken away, and that is
the great danger of the future. The
great danger is that there should be
formed inside our universities&mdash;especially,
I fear, inside Oxford&mdash;a
nucleus and focus of infidel teaching
and influence; not infidel in any
coarse or abusive sense, but in that
sense in which Prof. Palmer used
the words ‘heathen virtue.’ <i>I fear
that the danger we have to look to is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
that some colleges in Oxford may in the
future play a part similar to that disastrous
part which the German universities
have played in the dechristianization
of the upper and middle classes.</i>”
And the only advice he can give
to England now is: “If the parents
of England who send their sons to
these colleges will be alive to the
heavy responsibility which is now
laid upon them, then perhaps we
may have a better security, a better
guarantee, than we have had that
Oxford shall not be the means of
uprooting the Christian faith which
they had learnt at home.”</p>

<p>These words of the real, if not the
nominal, leader of the conservative
party in the British House of Lords,
who at the same time is, or was when
he delivered the speech, chancellor
of the university of Oxford, are
worthy of attention, and may be
commended to that fussy little termagant,
the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. They
have been doubly corroborated since
by another British statesman whose
testimony on such a subject is of at
least equal weight with that of the
ultra-liberal journal, inasmuch as he
is the leader of the liberal party&mdash;the
present Premier of England, in his
recent great speech at Liverpool,
which was principally devoted to exposing
the errors of Strauss.</p>

<p>Passing on to the other laws, why,
considered merely from a financial
point of view, should the creation
of new seminaries, great or small,
be prohibited? This is controlling
the private purse with a vengeance.
The Prussian state, or Prince Bismarck
and the professordom, forbid
Prussians or anybody else to erect
ecclesiastical seminaries. Of course,
this means that Prussian or German
youth are in future to be educated
only in the state schools and universities.
If they want to become
priests, they must learn their theology
as best they may; at least there
shall be no schools or colleges for
them to study in, for those already
in existence are to be placed under
state surveillance, to receive no new
pupils&mdash;in a word, to be closed, or
converted from the purpose for which
they were founded by private funds
into state schools with state professors
at their head, which is just as
though Gen. Grant swooped down
on all the banking-houses in the
United States, set them under government
control, and bade the bankers
go about their business. And
yet Catholics who find some reason
to object to this summary mode of
dealing with their property and what
they considered were their rights, are
told that they are traitors to the
state, conspirators against the empire,
and that they only object in slavish
obedience to a mandate from Rome.</p>

<p>This measure was well devised.
Its framers said: We have banished
the Jesuits; we have banished religious
societies of every description;
we have abolished the sacrament of
marriage; we have banished religion
from the schools; we now proceed
to abolish ecclesiastical seminaries
altogether: that is to say, we abolish
the priesthood, we abolish God as
far as Germany is concerned, and
men shall worship us and us only&mdash;the
supreme power.</p>

<p>What else does this law mean?
It strikes out the priesthood, root
and branch, as effectually as did the
penal laws in England; nay, more
so. The next clause fits in neatly.
The bishop who nominates a candidate
otherwise than in accordance
with the law is fined heavily. As
there are a good number of bishops,
and as they are likely to disregard
the law in this respect, this will
ensure a constant revenue to the
state as long at least as they are allowed
to remain in the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>Ecclesiastical disciplinary power
can only be exercised by ecclesiastical
authorities of German nationality.
This, of course, is a blow struck directly
at the Pope in his capacity of
universal head of the church; indirectly
at whoever may hereafter be
appointed as bishops of the church in
Germany. It simply forbids the Catholic
bishops and priests to obey
the commands of the Holy See, and,
if carried out, would be subversive of
the whole edifice of Christ’s church,
which its divine Founder made one,
indivisible, and CATHOLIC. “Go
ye, therefore, and teach <i>all</i> nations.”
Prince Bismarck aims at carrying
out what Bolanden calls “the Russian
idea”&mdash;the erection in Germany
of a state popedom. And again, Catholics
are traitors to the state for
objecting to it, though it is an
amendment introduced into Article
15 of the Prussian constitution for the
purpose of nullifying that truly liberal
and wise measure, which was to
the following effect:</p>

<p>The Evangelical and the Roman
Catholic Churches, as well as all
other religious societies, may administer
and regulate their affairs in perfect
freedom. All religious societies
may continue in the possession and
enjoyment of their institutions, foundations,
and funds destined for worship,
instruction, and charity.</p>

<p>This is the law that works in England,
in this country, and wherever
else the name of freedom is known.
It left the Catholic Church little to
desire in Prussia. The justice, the
wisdom and necessity of substituting
for this law those which appear at
the head of this article, will be apparent.</p>

<p>Moreover, that same article very
wisely and fairly provided that the
state right of nominating, proposing,
electing, and confirming in the offices
of the church be suppressed, with
the single exception of ecclesiastical
appointments in the army and in public
establishments.</p>

<p>That law worked to the satisfaction
of all parties&mdash;the state, the
Evangelicals, and the Catholics. The
state never complained of it; the
Evangelical Church never complained
of it; the Catholic Church
never complained of it. Why reverse
this order now? Why, after
handing the disciplinary power over
into the hands of the church, and
after having proved it so satisfactorily
for half a century, do you now
forbid the exercise of that power by
authority which is not of German
nationality? The constitution of the
Catholic Church is exactly the same
now as it was when that article was
drawn up. The Catholic bishops
were not self-appointed. Who conferred
ecclesiastical disciplinary power
in the first instance? The church
through its head, the representative
of Jesus Christ, who is not of German
nationality; who, as head of the
Catholic Church, is of no nationality;
and to whom in that capacity the
question of nationality does not
apply: for the laws of which he is
the keeper refer to the spiritual part
of man’s nature, the moral order,
which in all men is the same, and
which takes as little color from the
accidents of place or climate as it
does from the darkness or the whiteness
of the skin.</p>

<p>This law cannot be obeyed: its
framers evidently were assured of
this fact, for they provide that the
ecclesiastical functionaries who, by
exercise of their functions, transgress
the laws of the state or the ordinances
of the civil authority, may, at the
demand of that authority, be deposed,
if the maintaining of their
functions prove incompatible with
public order.</p>

<p>This means the destruction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
Catholic episcopate, or its total subserviency
to the state. “I will strike
the shepherd, and the flock will be
dispersed,” said our Lord on a memorable
occasion. That is precisely
what Prince Bismarck says: Take
all power out of the hands of the
Pope; destroy the bishops if you
cannot win them over to the state;
strive to set priest against superior,
by telling him that, if he disobey, the
voice of his church is powerless to
affect him whilst the arm of the state
supports him. Swell the ranks of the
“Old Catholic” party thus, and we
shall force a schism on the church;
after a short time, the people will go
this way and that; the true shepherds
gone, the flock will be dispersed, and
the nation is ours to do as we please
with, for there is no longer the voice
of religion to rise up against us: the
people are ripe for the worship of
force.</p>

<p>Observe the steps which have led
up to the present consummation from
the foundation of the German Empire
two years ago. The Jesuits, the vanguard
of the church, are driven out.
Why? For conspiring against the
empire. Proofs? None.</p>

<p>All the other orders are driven out
for the same reasons, and with the
like proofs of guilt.</p>

<p>The universities are placed in the
hands of infidels.</p>

<p>The schools are taken from the
hands of religious, and placed altogether
in the hands of the state.</p>

<p>The solemnization (!) of marriage
is placed in the hands of the state.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical seminaries are suppressed,
and given over to the state.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical students are for the
future to be educated and appointed
by the state.</p>

<p>Catholics must not subscribe money
to build colleges of their own; if they
do, those colleges will, like all the
others, be appropriated by the state.</p>

<p>The bishops, the divinely appointed
successors of the apostles, are only
allowed to hold office at the will of
the state.</p>

<p>He who disobeys is deposed from
office by the state. The church is
a thing of state. The human conscience
is a thing of state. It has
no rights, no thoughts, no feelings,
no desires, that are not absolutely
controlled by the state, “for in the
kingdom of this world the state has
dominion and precedence.”</p>

<p>There is the whole doctrine out,
plain and undisguised. Those last
words are taken from the speech delivered
by Prince Bismarck to the
House of Peers in the debate of
March 10 on the question under consideration.
And now that they are
there, what is the state?</p>

<p>“The state is I,” said Louis XIV.,
and he was right in his estimate; but
the fact of his having been right at
the time when he made the boast did
not prevent the French Revolution,
rather helped it on, and does not
prevent us to-day from repudiating
the doctrine.</p>

<p>What constitutes the state in Prince
Bismarck’s eyes? Is it the emperor,
or himself, or Dr. Falk, or the German
professordom? Is it the representatives
of the country as collected in
the Lower and Upper Prussian
Houses? On the educational question,
the Upper House, in which lay
the strength of the conservative party,
gave an adverse vote to the government,
and the House was immediately
dissolved. A number of mushroom
peers were hastily created in an
unconstitutional manner, and sent in
as the creatures of Prince Bismarck,
for the sole purpose of passing these
bills, in order to give a show of free
discussion, and make the measure of
Prince Bismarck appear as the will of
the nation. But does the following
read like the speech of a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
was likely to favor free discussion, or
rather, of one who pined for absolutism,
and was determined to have it?
It is an extract from the speech of
the prince on resigning the premiership
of the Prussian Parliament to
Count von Roon: “There is no fear
that Prussia will lose her legitimate
influence in the federal government,
even if the individual members of the
cabinet are not on all questions at
one.... Prussia’s territory making
five-eighths of all Germany, she
will always command the authority
naturally belonging to her. Besides,
the identity of the German and Prussian
politics is guaranteed by the fact
that the German Emperor and the
King of Prussia happen to be one
and the same person. <i>I do not deny
that the premier should be invested with
more extensive prerogatives than are
now his own.</i> He might, for instance,
be accorded the right of suspending
the decisions of the cabinet until their
approval or otherwise by the king;
or he might be granted some other
prerogative with a view to regulating
the action of the administration. <i>All
this, I dare say, will come to pass in
course of time</i>, but, not being as yet
conceded to him, he has to shift as
best he may.... There is too
much talking over one’s colleagues
involved in the premiership to leave
a man time for anything else.”</p>

<p>That speech was delivered some
months ago. Since then, the speaker
has come nearer to the boast of Louis
XIV. This is how the echo of the
German chancellor, the Berlin special
correspondent of the London <i>Times</i>,
speaks of it, with a cringing tone that
to free stomachs brings an absolute
nausea: “With a decisive struggle
against popery looming ahead, it
would be a great mistake in this loyal
and king-loving country to strip the
ministry of the authority it derives
from representing <i>the crown rather
than the parliament</i>”; whilst the
<i>Times</i> itself remarks editorially, with
a mental blindness strange indeed, if
unintentional: “We do not anticipate
any retrogression in the development
of Prussia, but it seems inevitable
that there should be some check in
the progress of change, some slackening
in the audacity of legislation,
some disposition to rest and be thankful.”</p>

<p>To show how far freedom of discussion
prevails in the Prussian Parliament
over and above the speech
quoted of Prince Bismarck, the dissolution
of the Upper House on refusing
to go the length of the government
on the education question, and
the creation of new peers for the purpose
of overcoming that opposition,
may be added the very significant
announcement made by Dr. Falk on
presenting the bill to the Chamber
in the first instance, before a word of
discussion had taken place on it, that
his majesty’s sanction was certain beforehand;
which was saying practically:
You may vote as you please,
but this bill must be passed, and he
who opposes its passage is an enemy
to the throne&mdash;no small threat in a
military nation.</p>

<p>So much for freedom of discussion!
Where, then, is one to find that mysterious
body, the state, of which
there is so much talk? Of course,
this bill has passed both houses; it
has been debated and divided on,
and the divisions have gone with the
ministry. Well, in representative
governments, such is the rule. Whatever
the majority votes becomes law.
All looks fair. The bill has gone
against the Catholics, and that is all
that can be said about it.</p>

<p>But how has it gone against them?
It is a sweeping measure; of that
there can be no doubt. It is the
most tremendous measure framed
within this century, perhaps in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
time, for the suppression of the faith;
for, to any honest mind, these laws
are absolute suppression of all that
constitutes the Catholic Church, so
far as human enactments can effect
it. Prince Bismarck endeavored
from the beginning of this contest
with the church to throw a false
light over it. He banished the Jesuits
and the other orders on the plea
that they were conspiring against the
empire. There was no trial, or
searching, or investigation. It was
simply his <i>ipse dixit</i>: he commanded,
and they were banished. At that time
his contest, as he and his organs
and representatives in the Chamber
continued to assure the world, was
one with conspirators, and in no wise
with the Catholic Church. The
secularization, which has been better
called the dechristianization, of the
schools, and the abolition of the sacrament
of marriage, had nothing
whatever to do with the Catholic
faith. What mockery! Now he
comes and forces this bill through
the parliament, which, if carried out,
as it doubtless will be to the letter&mdash;for
Prince Bismarck does nothing by
halves&mdash;simply and absolutely stops
the life of religion, not alone the
Catholic, but all religion with any
pretension to the name, throughout
Germany; and still he persists in declaring
that the contest is not with
the church. In his speech of March
10, which will be remembered in
history, and in calmer moments read
aright by all, the prince chancellor
said: “The question in which we
are at present involved is placed,
according to my judgment, in a false
light if we call it a confessional religious
question. It is essentially
political; it has nothing to do with
the conflict of an evangelical dynasty
against the Catholic Church,
as our Catholic fellow-citizens are
taught to believe; it has nothing to
do with the conflict between faith
and infidelity: it has solely to do
with the ancient contest for dominion,
which is as old as the human
race; with the contest for power
between monarchy and priesthood&mdash;the
contest which is much older than
the appearance of the Redeemer in
the world.”</p>

<p>Now, if this statement of the relative
position of the opposing forces
be correct, Prince Bismarck makes
the contest all the easier for the
Catholics. He professes to remove
it altogether out of the region
of religion into that of politics, and
thus the conflict, according to him,
is one between two purely political
parties. As will be shown, the party
opposed to the present Bismarck
policy is not at all restricted to the
Catholics; it embraces the greater
portion of the Evangelicals, most
probably all of them, as well as those
who, outside of Germany, would be
called democrats. Basing the contest,
then, on purely political grounds,
the majority of the German Empire
is driven by sheer force of the will
of one man or of a few men, backed
by the most powerful army in the
world, into accepting a state of
things which it abhors, and against
which it vehemently protests. The
claims of either party are to be decided
purely on their own merits,
and the verdict of a fair mind cannot
fail to side with that at whose head
stand the Catholics; for they claim
nothing more than that the Prussian
constitution, under which all up to
the present have lived happily, be
preserved inviolate. “Leave the
Prussian law as it stood,” demand
the Catholics and the Evangelicals.
“We are content with it; we demand
nothing more.” How such a
plain and patriotic request can be
contorted into conspiracy against the
empire it is hard to conceive. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
for the allegation that the relations
of Catholics to the state have been
altered one jot by the declaration
of infallibility, that is idle. Catholics
believe now precisely what they
believed from the beginning. Prince
Bismarck, then, was fully alive to
the importance of the question he
was engaged in at the time. It was
no insignificant measure that might
quietly sneak through the House
almost without the House being
aware of its existence. The German
Empire numbers 40,000,000 of
souls; of these 14,000,000 are Catholics;
that is to say, more than
one-third of the entire population.
Call the relation existing to-day between
these 14,000,000 of Catholics
and the head of their church, the
Pope, between them and their
bishops and clergy, what you please,
political or religious, the result of the
passing of this measure is one and
the same&mdash;the total breaking up of
that relation in all that makes it
what it is, in so far as it lies in Prince
von Bismarck to effect that result.
And so the world understands it.</p>

<p>“There is no parallel in history,”
says the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, “to the
experiment which the German statesmen
are resolutely bent on trying,
except the memorable achievement
of Englishmen under the guidance
of Henry VIII.... Like all these
measures, the new law concerning the
education of ecclesiastical functionaries,
which is the most striking of
the number, will apply to all sects
indifferently, but, in its application to
the Roman Catholic priesthood, it
almost takes one’s breath away.”</p>

<p>The London <i>Times</i> of April 19, in
a curious article on our Holy Father
which will call for attention afterwards,
sums up the situation thus:</p>

<p>“The measures now in the German
Parliament, and likely to become
[which since have become]
law, amount to a secular organization
so complete as not to leave the
Pope a soul, a place, an hour, that he
can call entirely his own. Germany
asserts for the civil power the control
of all education, the imposition
of its own conditions on entrance to
either civil or ecclesiastical office,
the administration of all discipline,
and at every point the right to confine
religious teachers and preachers
to purely doctrinal and moral topics.
Henceforth there is to be neither
priest, nor bishop, nor cardinal, nor
teacher, nor preacher, nor proclamation,
nor public act, nor penalty, nor
anything that man can hear, do, or
say for the soul’s good of man in
Germany, without the proper authorization,
mark, and livery of the
emperor.”</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> is no special advocate
of Catholic interests, so that, when it
puts the case thus, it is out of no love
for them. But after such a graphic
picture of the situation, it is needless
to reiterate what has been maintained,
that, call these measures what
you please, they simply involve and
mean the legal suppression of the
Catholic Church in Germany.</p>

<p>The bill, then, required some consideration;
for it could only be regarded
by one-third of the empire
at least, and by the millions of their
co-religionists outside the empire,
not simply as an outrage on their
conscience&mdash;that would be a weak
word for it&mdash;but as a measure,
whether it passed or was defeated,
to be resisted with all the power that
lies in man’s nature. In this light
alone could it be looked upon by
the Catholics, and thus the hearts
of one-third of the empire were at
once and, if freedom of conscience
be not a meaningless phrase, most
justly alienated from the government
of an empire scarce yet two
years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span></p>

<p>But the opposition was not confined
to Catholics alone. The Evangelical
party, though a few of its
members and organs had opposed
the intermeddling of the state with
church affairs from the first, as a
whole accepted the expulsion of the
Jesuits and the other arbitrary measures
as a good thing, and as a
deadly blow struck at Rome. But
when these crowning measures appeared,
it saw that, as usual, the
blow struck at Rome was a blow
struck at all freedom, and strove to
retract when too late. To quote the
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> again:</p>

<p>“The difficulties of Prince Bismarck
are not decreasing. The
Jesuits have found a fresh ally in
Prussia, and the ranks of the enemies
of the new ecclesiastical legislation
are swollen by combatants
whose loyalty hitherto has been unswerving.
Herr von Gerlach no
longer stands alone as a Protestant
opponent of the chancellor’s policy.
A portion of the Evangelical clergy
and a section of the Protestant aristocracy
of the old provinces of the
kingdom have passed over into the
camp of the enemy. In Pomerania
and Silesia, a bitterness of antagonism
has revealed itself which was never
suspected. The feelings that have
fed this opposition have evidently
been long in existence, but only now
have they betrayed themselves openly.
The occasion on which this was
done was the emperor’s birthday.
It has been customary to have religious
services in the churches at
such times, and they had come to be
expected by the population as a regular
part of the celebration. This
year, however, many of the Evangelical
clergy in different towns omitted
the usual services, and kept their
churches closed. A letter in the
<i>Spener Gazette</i> remarks upon the
astonishment excited in Neusalz, in
Lower Silesia, because of the omission.
Another letter from Wolgast
says neither in that town nor in
Kammin or Schievelbein was ‘the
divine service held to which we have
been always accustomed.’ The same
thing occurred at Wernigerode, where
the only notice of the occasion was
in the prayers at the usual Sunday
service the day after. These facts
have excited much comment in Germany.
The official papers openly
accuse the Protestant clergy of the
eastern provinces of becoming the
allies of the ultramontanes” (April
12).</p>

<p>Thus does this “loyal and king-loving”
people manifest its gratitude
to the monarch for the forcing of
this bill upon it. How is it that
the bill hurts them, the Evangelicals,
who detest the Pope, most of them,
just as cordially as does Prince Bismarck?
Alas for human nature!
There was a touch of the weakness
of the flesh in it after all.</p>

<p>When this bill met their gaze, the
eyes of the Evangelicals were at last
opened. They saw that its provisions
were all-embracing, and that
there was no distinction made between
Catholic and Protestant, so
just and righteous to all is the Gospel
promulgated by Prince Bismarck&mdash;the
gospel of the state! They had
thought to get off scot-free; they lent
no voice to the noble protest of the
Catholic bishops at Fulda; but at
length their zeal is aroused, and they
generously throw their weight into
the scale, praying that the new laws
may take the form of exceptional
measures for the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Such was the form which the
Evangelical objection took&mdash;on purely
conscientious grounds, no doubt.
While the internal budget was being
discussed, some of the progressionists
were so stupidly logical as to
vote a refusal of the very respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
subsidy which this generous, charitable,
and conscientious body enjoys.
But Dr. Falk, the liberal, came to
the rescue, and saved it.</p>

<p>The Prussian correspondent of the
London <i>Times</i> has an instructive little
paragraph on this subject, which
may serve to throw some further
light on this eleventh-hour opposition:</p>

<p>“But the Catholic dignitaries are
not the only ecclesiastics opposed
to the bill. The new measures
applying not only to the Catholic
Church, but to all religious communities
recognized by the state, the
Oberkirchenrath, or Supreme Consistory
of the Protestant Church
in the old provinces, has also thought
fit to caution the crown against the
enactment of these sweeping innovations.
The principal reason given
by the Oberkirchenrath against the
clause in the new laws facilitating secession
from a religious community,
is that many a Protestant might be
tempted to forsake his faith on the
eve of the building of a new church.
Rather than contribute his mite, as
compelled by law, he might prefer
being converted to something else.”</p>

<p>If letters could blush, that last sentence
ought to be of a scarlet color.
However, to keep to the question at
hand: whatever may have been the
motive, certain it is that at length the
Evangelical party, as a party, a body,
political or religious, as you please, is
aroused, and turns upon the government,
of which it was ready to be the
obedient servant so long as all things
went smoothly. A similar instance
of a great uprising of religious zeal
against government innovation was
exhibited and is witnessed still in that
“loyal and king-loving” body, the
Irish Protestants, on the disestablishment
of what was called the Irish
Church. Here, then, are the Evangelicals
protesting against the government,
and the Catholics protesting
against the government; how
much of the nation is left? The
Catholics are 14,000,000; the number
of the Evangelicals is unknown to
the writer, but it probably doubles,
perhaps trebles, that of the Catholics&mdash;certainly
in Prussia; at all events, it
may be safely said that the majority
of the German Empire protests
against these laws. Where is the
state to be found, then? The state
certainly does not lie in the majority
of the people. On purely political
grounds, therefore, Prince Bismarck’s
measure is tyrannical; nevertheless,
“in the kingdom of this world, the
state has dominion and precedence.”</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“Ave, Cæsar! Morituri te salutant!”</p>

<p class="p1">Prince Bismarck expected this opposition.
So powerful did he imagine
it would be that he even feared
it, and in his own speeches and organs
mingled cajolery with threats.
Whilst the ecclesiastical bills were
still being debated, the <i>Provinzial-Correspondenz</i>
(official), in a flaring
article on the protest of the Catholic
bishops at Fulda, and the Catholic
opposition to the ecclesiastical laws,
wrote:</p>

<p>“The state, of course, being responsible
for the welfare of the inhabitants
in every measure adopted,
will have to be guided by a <i>strict regard
for what is just and upright</i>. It
will have carefully to refrain from
meddling with the creed or interfering
with the ecclesiastical institutions
and usages immediately connected
with the sphere of religious
belief. Only the other day, the Minister
of Education (Dr. Falk) expressed
his conviction in the Lower House
that, directly the new bills became
law, the Catholic subjects would perceive
that no one intended to injure
their religious faith, oppress their
church, or interfere with the preaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
of saving truth.” (Dr. Falk’s convictions
are of a piece with his notions
of “truth.”) ... “In carrying
through their present task, government
is prepared to encounter serious
resistance and much trouble;
but it is also aware that the bills now
under discussion, if once they become
law, will supply it with effective
means of exerting its authority.... If
the washes of the government and
parliament are fulfilled, the bills under
discussion will be a work of
peace.”</p>

<p>“That is, in case the bishops
yield,” remarks the Prussian correspondent
of the London <i>Times</i>. “In
the other event, they are sure to be
successively fined, deposed, incarcerated,
and perhaps sent out of the
country. All this the new legislation
empowers the government to effect.”</p>

<p>The government, then, or the state,
or whatever be the name by which
Prince Bismarck chooses to be called,
dreaded a powerful opposition.
Nevertheless, it determined to pass
these bills&mdash;which were absolutely
uncalled for, as far as the harmony
of the relations between Catholic and
Protestant went, and that of either
or both of these bodies with what
ought to be the state, the true representative
rulers of the people, and
not a man or a few men elevated on
the bayonets of a million soldiers&mdash;conscious
that it was doing what the
conscience of its people might of
necessity endure for a time, but could
never consent to. How long, then,
did it take to bring this stupendous
measure about, fraught as it was with
all these consequences, and a cause
of alarm and anxiety even to the
government itself with all its bayonets?</p>

<p>The laws are dated January 8 of
this year; they were presented to the
Chamber on the following day, and,
by the 21st of the same month, their
first discussion is over. On April
25, they finally passed the Upper
House.</p>

<p>In three months! A bill which
altered throughout the whole relations
between church and state in
Germany, down to their minutest
details; which involved the appropriation
to state purposes of every
ecclesiastical college or seminary
subscribed for, and erected, and
founded by the money of private individuals;
which, involving as it does
the suppression of the bishops and
the clergy, as a necessary consequence
hands over to the state a
vast amount of funded property in
churches and houses; which, above
all this, meets religion at every turn,
and makes it bow down and worship
the state; which threatens a future of
disturbance and danger of every
kind&mdash;is pushed through both Houses
of Parliament, and supposed to be
fully discussed and decided on in a
period of three months!</p>

<p>Why, a bill for the laying of a new
line of railroad twenty miles in length
would have required longer time and
called for more discussion. There it
stands now, law, and all Germany
must obey it, because the state calls
it law. On April 24, Germany
could be Christian; on April 26,
to be Christian is a crime against
the state; to obey the dictates of
conscience is a crime; to establish a
school in the name of God is a
crime; to establish a college for the
education of God’s ministry is a
crime; to obey the pastors, the
priests, and bishops of God’s church,
whom to obey hitherto was a virtue,
is now a crime; to acknowledge the
Pope as the head of the universal
church, a crime; in a word, to be
anything but German, body and soul,
mind and heart and thought, is a
crime, to be punished by all the rigor
of the law!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince Bismarck, while he is about
it, should go further. “To-day we
will proceed to create God,” said a
countryman of his, a philosopher, an
enlightened man and apostle of the
stamp of Dr. Falk, the putative father
of these bills. The chancellor should
create a German heaven to correspond
with this German religion and
reward its devotees, the worshippers
of the divine state. What German
Dante will arise to give us the Bismarck
<i>Inferno</i>?</p>

<p>The steps which led up to this
measure, the ingredients which compose
it, the manner in which it was
forced through, the meaning of it,
and the effect, if carried out, it will
produce on religion, have now been
set before the reader, and he may
fairly pronounce for himself upon the
whole question. But the question
asked at the beginning remains still
unanswered: <i>Why</i> has all this come
about? Why has so wise a statesman
as Prince Bismarck is reputed to
be raked up these embers of dissension,
and fanned them into so fierce
a flame? Is it to his advantage to
turn one-third, the majority even, of
his empire against him? Why, if
the contest were not, as he and his
supporters of the liberal and religious
press allege, in a manner forced upon
him, should he be so unwise as to
run the danger of rending his empire
asunder, and opening up that
bitterest of difficulties, the religious
question, which lay so quiet? In
one word, was or was not the Catholic
Church a danger to the new empire?</p>

<p>This is becoming the question of
the day; and what concerns Germany
concerns the whole world.
The Catholic Church is a danger to
the state.</p>

<p>Again, why?</p>

<p>Because you obey an infallible
Pontiff, an absolute ruler, blindly
and implicitly. Matters were not
quite so bad before the declaration
of the dogma of infallibility; but
since that date, the Pope has taken a
new stand which governments cannot
admit. They cannot endure to have
any portion of their subjects ruled by
a foreign potentate. They cannot
have their measures thwarted and
decrees opposed by a mandate, open
or secret, from Rome. They cannot
admit the pretensions of a well-meaning,
no doubt, but rather unpractical
and decidedly impracticable old gentleman
to the sovereignty over the
whole world. Those whom he claims
as his subjects may venerate him as
much as they choose; they may even
obey him, as far as believing in a
God and all that sort of thing goes,
if it bring any unction to their souls;
they may believe in any mortal or
immortal thing they please; but they
must obey the laws of the land in
which they live, <i>whatever those laws
may be</i>. Religious belief may be
anything you please, as long as it is
confined to the individual’s mental
faith; but his conduct must not be
ruled by it. Whenever religion
crosses the state, religion must give
way. Governments cannot admit
the disloyal theory of “a Catholic
first, a nationalist if you will.”</p>

<p>It all lies there: the contest between
Prince Bismarck and the
church, between Italy and the church,
between the whole world and the
church. This contest did not begin
with the German chancellor. There
is a power behind the throne that
moves even him to this deed of violence
upon the sacred person of the
spouse of Christ, his holy church:
the same old tempter that first whispered
to man in Eden: “Ye shall
be as gods”; that drove the kings to
stone and persecute the prophets;
that moved the Jews to crucify
Christ; that directed the arm of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
pagan emperors of Rome. It is not
in man of his own will merely to stir
up this strife, and wage war upon his
brother for the matter of faith. The
spirit of evil is ever working; and his
present chief representative, unconsciously
it may be hoped, is the powerful
chancellor of the German Empire.
Here is his standpoint, as given by
the Berlin correspondent of the New
York <i>Herald</i>, in the remarkable
speech of March 10. In the extract
already given, the chancellor pronounced
the contest he has entered
upon as having “solely to do with
the ancient contest for dominion,
which is as old as the human race;
with the contest for power between
monarchy and priesthood&mdash;the contest
which is much older than the
appearance of the Redeemer in the
world.” After endeavoring to connect
every great movement of recent
and mediæval history inimical, or
supposed to be inimical, to Germany
with the machinations of the Papacy,
he goes on to say: “It is, in my estimation,
a falsification of politics and
of history when His Holiness the Pope
is considered exclusively as the high-priest
of any one confession, or the
Catholic Church as representative of
churchdom in general. The Papacy
has been in all times a political power
which, with the determination and
with the greatest success, interfered
in all the relations of this world;
which meant to interfere, and considered
such interference as its legitimate
programme. This programme is
well known. The aim constantly
kept in view by the Papal power
(like the Rhine borders before the
eyes of the French)&mdash;the programme
which, at the time of the mediæval
emperors, was very nearly realized&mdash;is
the making the secular power subject
to the clerical&mdash;an aim eminently
political, the effort to attain which
is, however, as old as humanity; for
so long have there been persons,
whether cunning people or real
priests, who have asserted that the
will of God was better known to them
than to their fellow-citizens; and it
is well known that this principle is
the foundation of the Papal claim to
dominion.”</p>

<p>Now, there is no denying that this is
a very fascinating doctrine for nations.
The rulers studiously misrepresent
the Papacy, setting it down as a political
power: as that most dangerous
of political powers which would
clothe politics in the garb of religion,
as Mahomet did, and give to their selfish
schemes the name of the cause of
God, so as to arouse an enthusiasm
and fanaticism in their devotees
which mere human powers can never
hope to enkindle. Mahomet was
just one of those “cunning people”
who “asserted that the will of God
was better known to him than to his
fellow-citizens,” if they could be designated
by that title. And the conquests
that Mahomet achieved by
that deceit are in the memory of all.
The Pope is the Mahomet of the
XIXth century, according to Prince
Bismarck.</p>

<p>When Shakespeare put that famous
sentence into the mouth of King
John, “No foreign power shall tithe
or toll in my dominions,” he only
said the same thing. “You are about
to disestablish the church in Ireland,
because it was imposed by a foreign
power,” said Mr. Disraeli, during the
debates on the question of the disestablishment.
“You will do so; but
what will you have in its place? A
nation ruled by a foreign power; for
the Pope is an absolute sovereign.”
The words are from memory; but
the aim and substance are correct, and
he of all men understood the fallacy
of the argument; but he knew that
it was a valuable party-cry to stir the
blood of the patriotic Englishman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
So, recently, Mr. Gladstone told the
House of Commons that the Irish
University Bill was defeated by
Cardinal Cullen, under mandate, of
course, from Rome. And so runs
the cry through the world.</p>

<p>It buzzes around our ears out here
even in certain quarters, though much
less, happily, than it was wont to do.
Terror of Rome! is the string to
harp on. The Catholics wish to
surrender the country into the hands
of the Pope!</p>

<p>Laying aside the consideration of
the practical impossibility of such a
thing, suppose the Pope did reign as
emperor in Germany to-day, would
the people be less happy than they
show themselves to be under the
rule of Prince Bismarck? Would
the Pope encircle his throne with a
cordon of steel, or reign in the hearts
of his people? How much happier
are the inhabitants of the Papal
States to-day under the rule of Victor
Emanuel than they were under that
of Pius IX.? Let the correspondents
of the secular press answer with their
periodical record of outrage and
crime.</p>

<p>How is it possible to convince
people that all these allegations are
utterly and maliciously false? The
Pope is infallible; and so was Peter
when our Lord made him the rock
upon which he should build his
church. Peter had the same conflict
with Rome that Pius has with Germany,
not simply because he was
Peter, the head of the church on
earth, and the vicar of Jesus Christ,
but because he was a Christian. And
every Christian who is faithful to the
law of his crucified Master is bound
to say to the state “I cannot” when
the state would have him deny that
Master, and break loose from the
teachings of the church. It is not
the Pope these men are fighting: it
is Christianity. As far as the German
laws of making the divinely
instituted sacrament of matrimony a
merely civil contract, of preaching
disobedience to the pastors of the
church, go, were the Pope to die to-day,
and, if possible, an interregnum,
which seems to be so desired by
many, to ensue, that fact would not
make a bit of difference in the opposition
of Catholics to these state
measures. Wrong would be wrong
still; the laws of God would remain
as binding as ever; and to hinge the
Catholic faith <i>in this fashion</i> on the
Papacy is a transparent trick. The
Pope teaches what Jesus Christ bade
him teach; and no pope has ever
swerved from that line.</p>

<p>It is almost useless to discuss this
theme, and yet it must be taken up,
though those violent opponents of
what they call ultramontanism, by
which they mean Catholicity, will
still continue to close their eyes to
the truth that the Catholic religion
has no connection of any kind with
politics as pure politics. But where
politics touches upon religion, of
course religion is to be taken into
account. It would far overstep this
article to go into all the details and
intricacies of this question; but the
statement of the position which Catholics
take upon the subject may
serve best to put the matter before
the reader.</p>

<p>Catholics read history differently
from Prince Bismarck and the scientific
historians who surround him.
For them all practical history, if the
term may be used, begins with Jesus
Christ. All the rest, as far as theories
of government, of the relations
of the state to the individual, go,
may be considered as blotted out, as
a <i>tabula rasa</i>, and the world, in the
moral order, began anew. Before
the coming of our Lord there was no
government, in the modern sense of
the word, outside of the Jewish nation:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
there was force. Jesus Christ
laid down laws which should enter
into every relation of the life of man,
and could not be mistaken. These
laws were just as binding on the
monarch as on the subject, on the
government as on the governed;
they did not destroy government:
they guided and helped it, and infused
into it the first principles of
freedom. Men recognized this fact,
and, as Christianity advanced, governments
began to fashion themselves
closer and closer upon the law of
the Gospel, until at length what is
known as Christendom grew up,
grounded, as its very name implied,
upon the religion of Christ&mdash;that is
to say, upon the law of Christ. Of
course, in the various governments,
many things remained contrary to
this law, not, however, as rights, but
as wrongs which only time and
Christian influence could remove.
However, governments were measured
as to their justice and injustice,
not by a standard antecedent to the
Christian era, nor by any standard
which they might choose to set up
for themselves, but by their assimilation
to, their agreement or disagreement
with, the law of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Of course, to those who deny the
divinity of Jesus Christ, all this reasoning
goes for nothing; but Prince
Bismarck does not profess to do so.
Where, then, was this law to be found?
Had it a keeper, a guardian, a propounder,
one to whose care its divine
Founder had entrusted it, guarded
against the possibility of mistaking its
teachings, or did he leave the dead
letter to commend itself in a variety
of ways to a variety of minds? Were
all men blessed from birth with perfect
intelligence and personal infallibility,
there would have been no need
of leaving anything more than the
dead letter of the law, as in that case
all would have agreed as to its meaning.
But as men do not as a rule lay
claim to perfect intelligence and personal
infallibility, without going further
into the question here, it seems
obvious to common sense that, if Christ
left a law to the world, he left it in
somebody’s keeping: he left a government
and a head, as the representative
of himself. This representative
is the Pope, whom all Christendom
recognized for so many centuries,
not as king of this mundane world,
but as the supreme head of the universal
church of Christ.</p>

<p>In time, he came to have a patrimony
of his own, which was freely
given him, and has been recently
very freely taken from him. That
patrimony he did not rule infallibly
as king. His policy as an earthly
monarch might even be defective,
like that of any other ruler; but, in
the domain of faith and morals, he,
when speaking <i>ex cathedrâ</i>, could not
err, and Christendom bowed to his
decisions.</p>

<p>Here it is, then, that Catholics bind
their faith in the Pope; not in Pius
IX. as ruler of Rome, but in Pius IX.
as the successor of Peter, as the vicar
of Jesus Christ, as his living representative
on earth. When, therefore,
Christendom departs from Christianity,
from the law of Christ upon which
it was founded, and devises measures
or promulgates doctrines in opposition
to the law of Christ, Catholics
look to the decision of him with whom
the Word abides to say if this be true
or untrue, right or wrong. He pronounces,
and they believe and obey.
He simply says this is or this is not
the law of Christ&mdash;the law that rules
the government as well as the governed.
If governments enforce wrong
with the strong arm, you must use all
lawful resistance; but, rather than
deny the truth, you must die as your
Saviour died.</p>

<p>The tendency of governments to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
is to say: “We bow to no law,
we recognize nothing higher than
ourselves, and the laws we make
must be obeyed without question.”
This is going back to the ante-Christian
era, and reviving the worship of
force. Such is the tendency to-day:
disbelief in Christ; disbelief, consequently,
in his doctrines, in his church,
in Christianity, in the head of his
church. To be Catholic, consequently,
is to be anti-national, in the
eyes of the state, when in reality it is
to be the truest citizen of the state.
Home employed a Christian legion,
and, though in bravery and devotion
to the empire that legion knew no
superior, many of its members were
martyred because they recognized a
spiritual power higher than the state.</p>

<p>And therein Catholicity is compelled
to oppose the state: dating from
Christ, believing in Christ, building
itself upon Christ, its followers members
of the church of Christ, it follows
the state in all things save where
it transgresses the commandments of
Christ; hence the <i>non possumus</i>.</p>

<p>Coming back, then, to the present
question, Catholics believe the Pope
to be the infallible head of the Catholic
Church, not the absolute emperor
of the kingdoms of this world. Jesus
Christ, whose vicar he is, himself
proclaimed, “My kingdom is not of
this world.” Nations may assume
what form of government best suits
them; all that is nothing to the Pope.
A Catholic is absolutely free in this
country, for instance, to vote whatever
ticket he may please, Republican
or Democratic. As far as those
names and their meaning go, Catholicity
has absolutely nothing whatever
to do with them. But a political
party erects what it calls a platform,
raises a party-cry, and, as in the present
instance in Prussia, calls itself
liberal, and its liberalism attempts to
wipe out absolutely the Catholic religion
from the land and from the
world if it could. Is it in human
reason to expect Catholics not to
allow their religion to influence their
votes in such a case as that, or in
such a case as the Irish university
question, or in any similar case that
might occur here?</p>

<p>What are votes given for? Surely
to protect ourselves against tyranny
of every form, and to secure our
proper representation in the body to
whose care is entrusted the government
of the country. God forbid
that religion should not influence
politics! Why should it not? Let
it alone; leave it free to do God’s
work; leave it its churches, its colleges,
its schools, its hospitals, its
asylums, its associations, its free worship,
its beliefs, and its institutions.
But if you come, as Prince Bismarck
has done, to say to religion, I will
take from you your schools, which are
your own private property; I will
take from you your sacraments,
which you believe to have been instituted
by Jesus Christ; I will strip
you of your ecclesiastical colleges,
and educate your students myself; I
will take your ordination out of the
hands of your bishops, and ordain
your priests myself; I will appoint
your bishops as I please, and they
who displease me are no longer
bishops; I will take from you your
head, the Pope, and make myself
pope in his stead: all this will I do,
but still you are at liberty to believe
in and worship God&mdash;what must the
answer be?</p>

<p>This is a mockery! This is paganism;
it is violence, not law. We cannot
obey. There, says Bismarck, or
the state, that is treason. Why cannot
you obey? Because the Pope,
“that old conjuror of the Vatican,”
forbids you. That is just the point:
either the Pope must rule or I.</p>

<p>Because conscience forbids me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
because human reason forbids me,
because Jesus Christ forbids me, is
the response of the Catholic. Catholics
cannot consent to the doctrine
that in the dominion of this world the
state has precedence. What is the
state? An accident. The Czar of Russia,
the Sultan of Turkey, Bismarck,
the British Parliament, the <i>Commune</i>,
all these in turn call themselves the
state. Government indeed is supreme,
and to be obeyed, <i>in its own
sphere</i>; but if there be no law higher
than the material laws which men
construct for themselves, and change
as occasion demands, good-by to all
stable government. If government
be merely a creation of man, it must
be subject to the varying temper of
man; it cannot fix absolutely the
rights of man; it can have no absolute
title to his obedience. We utterly
repudiate this doctrine, and refuse to
accept anything as final which we
construct for our own use. Its
powers are limited as are those of
all human institutions: once it oversteps
these boundaries, it becomes
tyranny. State to-day means Bismarck,
to-morrow the <i>Commune</i>; it
is a case of circumstances; and, if
there lie no law beyond all this, no
principles which are fixed and come
from a Power above “this world,”
one is as good as another. This
power is religion, and the church is
the embodiment of religion, and the
Pope is the head of the corporate
body, infallible indeed when teaching
the universal church, else is he an
accident the same as all the others.</p>

<p>Suppose our Blessed Lord were to
come down in the flesh at this moment
into Germany, what course
would he take upon this question?
Would he bow to Cæsar in this?
Neither will his vicar nor his children.
With the army at his back,
Prince Bismarck does this wrong.
It is said that he is driven to it for
the unity of Germany. Germany
was united without it. All the states
cheerfully submitted even to Prussian
preponderance, without thought of
dragging in the religious question.
The laws as they stood on that point
were satisfactory. Well, Germany is
united now; but it has become the
union of galley-slaves, chained together,
watched by a hard taskmaster
whose blow is death. The
enemy of true German unity to-day
is Prince Bismarck.</p>

<p>There is the law, and it is sure to
be carried out. Well, the bishops
will go to prison, will pay the fines,
or become exiles. They will continue
to ordain priests and educate them,
irrespective of that power called the
state. And the real difficulty begins
now. The Catholics cannot yield:
sooner or later, the state must.</p>

<p>One fact has come out of it all
which is worthy of notice. This
XIXth century, at least this latter
half of it, has been lauded and glorified
superabundantly as the age of
freedom, the liberal age.</p>

<p>Catholics began to forget their
history. They began to think the
era of persecution for conscience’
sake over, when they heard it proclaimed
on all sides that perfect
freedom of thought was the order of
the day; there was to be no such
distinction as Catholic or Protestant,
or Jew or Gentile, any more; the
lion was to lie down with the lamb,
the world to become a haven of
brotherly love, and the dawn of the
millennium was seen in the heavens.
The rack, the gibbet, the fagot, and
the hurdle were all to be banished
out of sight and forgotten, or only
preserved in museums as evidence of
what horrible beings our sires could
become. It was all very gushing and
nice; the narrow lines of prejudice were
to be softened down, and old-fogy,
stiff-kneed notions to be voted out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly rang out the voice of
Peter’s successor: <i>Liberalism</i> is false:
beware of it. It is only a few years
back since these words startled the
world in the Syllabus. A storm of
hatred and malign fury arose on all
sides, endeavoring to drown the
voice of the church. Who are you
who condemn us? asked the world.</p>

<p>The infallible head of the church!
Men proclaimed that Catholics themselves
did not accept it; and the
Catholic Church spoke out boldly in
these days, not to proclaim a new
doctrine, but only to acknowledge
to a doubting world what it had always
accepted and believed, that the
head of the church upon earth is infallible.
There was no more talk of
softening down of lines: Catholics
believed this, or were not Catholics.
Listen to the voice of one of the
bitterest and most persistent enemies
of the Pope, speaking only the other
day:</p>

<p>“It is impossible to imagine a belief
more sincere, a vision more intense,
a life more consistent, than
that of the man who has claimed for
more than a quarter of a century to
be the lord and master of the whole
world. If there be neither folly nor
sin in such a claim, then we may
admire Pius IX., <i>and indeed must
worship and obey him also</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Was the “intense vision” mistaken
in detecting the poison which lay at
the bottom of liberalism? Prince
Bismarck has just deserted the conservative
party to which he adhered
so long&mdash;all his political life almost&mdash;and
thrown himself into the arms of
the liberals. These ecclesiastical
bills are the result&mdash;such is liberalism.
“We will force your children to go
to our schools and receive the education
we give them, which you call godless,”
says Huxley, scientific liberal
like Dr. Falk. <i>La Commune</i> was the
essence of liberalism, and it shot the
Archbishop of Paris and the priests
out of pure sport apparently. “A
free church in a free state” was the
Cavour doctrine for liberal Italy, and
the bill for the appropriation of
church property and of that belonging
to the religious orders has followed
naturally upon the appropriation
of the Papal States and the imprisonment
of the head of the church.
Switzerland, the liberal republic, banishes
the Jesuits, closes the convents,
and follows Bismarck’s steps in its
dealings with the Catholic clergy.
The South American states are doing
the same in the name of liberalism.
The whole world may be traversed,
and wherever liberalism is strongest,
there is violence done in the name of
freedom.</p>

<p>And here in this free republic
men are found, like the writers in the
<i>Nation</i> and throughout the Protestant
press, to approve of all this. And
they are republicans&mdash;Americans&mdash;lovers
of freedom. If Americans,
they are traitors to their country, repudiators
of the principles of their
sires. They forget their history.
What brought the Pilgrim Fathers
hither? The refusal to take the
oath of supremacy to the state. Is
what was right in them wrong in us?
Freedom was the one word written
on the virgin brow of this yet young
republic. You who approve of these
measures in Prussia would wipe that
word out, and set in its place slavery.</p>

<p>The effect which these measures
have produced on the outer world is
significant. Those who hailed the
first outburst on the part of Prince
Bismarck with such loud acclaim
begin to hesitate and draw back.
The secular journals in this country
and in England, as a rule, either
watch and pronounce upon the steps
which have led up to this final outrage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
with timid caution, or, in a few instances,
with downright disapproval.</p>

<p>“We deny entirely that Prince
Bismarck himself ever adopted this
policy on its merits in the sense in
which the <i>Pall Mall</i> admires it. On
the contrary, we believe that, as a
statesman, he distrusted it seriously,
<i>and has even now little confidence in its
success</i>. We believe that it will result
in giving a new stimulus to Roman
Catholicism, and that the fanatical
vehemence with which the German
people have adopted it is a sufficient
evidence of <i>the rash and ill-considered
character of the policy itself</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>“This rough-and-ready method
of expelling ultramontane influences
‘by a fork’ can hardly fail to suggest
to a looker-on the probability that,
like similar methods of expelling
nature, it may lead to a reaction.
Downright persecution of this sort (we
are speaking now simply of the Jesuit
law), unless it is very thorough indeed&mdash;more
thorough than is well
possible in this XIXth century&mdash;usually
defeats itself.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>In this country, the secular press
seems generally inclined to shirk the
question, or devotes an occasional
paragraph to it from time to time, as
to a disagreeable subject which will
force itself upon the sight, but which
it is better to get out of the way as
speedily as possible. The religious
press among us has gone wild over it
from the beginning as a death-blow
to Rome. But even they begin to
distrust it, and soften their jubilant
notes to a mild <i>piano</i>, that they hope
all good from this measure&mdash;they do
not exactly see what good, but they
live in hope, whilst one of their
number, the New York <i>Observer</i>, a
fine hater of “Popery,” actually declared
the other day that, in its opinion,
“Cæsar was going too far.”</p>

<p>In Germany itself, as may be
gathered from some of the extracts
already given, the state-god is not
yet accepted as infallible and supreme
even in this world. Prince
Bismarck marches very fast; and he
would make Germany march with
him. Sedan was won by marching:
but this moral Sedan, as he would
consider it, laughs at the snail’s pace
of the other. There is such a thing
as “riding a gift horse to death”;
and Prince Bismarck seems intent
on accomplishing that foolish feat.</p>

<p>And here a word may be devoted
to the false allegation, which is now
beginning to be dropped, that the
Catholics were foes to the consolidation
of the empire. The Jesuits were
banished as conspirators against the
empire; the whole Catholic Church
was in a conspiracy against it; the
Pope had gone further, and, with
the rashness characteristic of him,
“openly declared war against Bismarck
and his ideas” (New York
<i>Nation</i>). We have looked in vain for
the details of this mysterious conspiracy,
which have not yet seen the light,
though it was so “well known.”
Not a single scrap of evidence appeared,
not a single riot occurred, not
a house was fired; there was no gun-powder
discovered, not even the
traditional slouched hat and dark-lantern;
the supreme majesty of the
law was never violated even in the
sacred person of a solitary policeman.</p>

<p>As for the other allegation, that
Catholics were opposed to the unity
of the fatherland, they had ample
opportunity to speak prior to the
war with France. There was no
necessity for the Catholic German
states to join Prussia, and spend their
wealth and the lives of their sons in
a terrible war. Why did not the
Catholic clergy and bishops and the
Pope, who are nothing but a political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
power, use the vast political power
which they are supposed to wield in
preventing the fatal alliance between
Protestant Prussia and the Catholic
states? Then was the time to
pronounce, and how did they pronounce?</p>

<p>There was no doubt or hesitation
on the part of either clergy or people.
Napoleon made the fatal mistake of
endeavoring to throw a religious
color over his campaign, to win
Catholic Germany to his side.
Catholic Germany stood by its
homes and altars, and its bishops,
priests, and Jesuits stood with it.
The Prussian Catholics gloried in
their country, and would yield the
palm of religious freedom to no
nation, not even to ourselves. Mgr.
Ketteler had long ago pronounced
for the unity of the German Empire.
So let that allegation drop.</p>

<p>After the war, each state continued
in full and free possession of the
right to manage its own home affairs:
Prussia was the centre of foreign
policy alone. First the Prussian
system of service in the army was
forced upon all, contrary to the wishes
of the states, particularly Bavaria.
When Prince Bismarck made up his
mind to force this ecclesiastical bill
upon Prussia, he saw clearly that,
if it remained law for Prussia only,
and a dead letter for all the federal
states outside, it could not stand: it
must be German or nothing. In
order to bring this about, he sounded
the states for the transfer of the home
policy also to the hands of Prussia.</p>

<p>The proposition was vigorously
opposed by all, chiefly by Bavaria.
Everybody understood the thing
dead, when suddenly the announcement
came one morning that all the
states, with the exception of Bavaria,
were in favor of placing the home
policy also in the hands of Prussia.
Bavaria was left to do as it pleased,
and now Prussia is the centre of all
power in Germany, so that the reins
of absolute government over a number
of federal states, which two years
ago were free, rest now in the hands
of a man whose chief doctrine is the
natural preponderance of Prussia.</p>

<p>The measures of the Bismarck
régime in Germany have been from
first to last measures of violence,
not simply as regards the Catholic
Church, but as regards the whole of
the federal states; and their effects
begin to show themselves already in
the disrespect shown the emperor on
his birthday, in the various riots
which have taken and are taking
place. And be it marked, not one
of these riots has been attributed to
the Catholics; they are too obedient
to the religion which Prince Bismarck
would destroy to take this
form of endeavoring to right their
wrongs. The riots have been generally
called beer riots; but they are
following so fast one upon the other,
and occurring in so many different
cities, that, however exciting a topic
beer may be, people begin to hint at
something else as cause for them.</p>

<p>“The riots at Stuttgart, which
were due, <i>apparently at least</i>, to the
hereditary quarrel with the Jews,
were paralleled at Frankfort on
Monday by a great beer riot, said to
be due to the high price of beer, in
which sixteen breweries were wrecked,
twelve persons killed, and one
hundred and twenty arrested. A
correspondent of yesterday’s <i>Times</i>,
who was in Frankfort and saw the
riot, regards the deeper and more remote
cause as being the thorough
dissatisfaction of the people with the
Prussian system of government.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Our readers will remember the
very serious riot which took place in
Berlin at the meeting of the emprors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
last year right under the noses
of their imperial majesties. A <i>Herald</i>
correspondent, writing on March 23,
tells of a riot in Berlin on the birthday
of the emperor; of another
which occurred on March 18, the
anniversary of the Revolution of
1848 in Berlin; and the correspondents
both of the London <i>Times</i> and
of the <i>Herald</i>, describe the ferocity
with which the mounted police
charged upon the unarmed mob,
using their drawn sabres. The <i>Herald</i>
correspondent concludes his letter
thus:</p>

<p>“A slight demonstration on the part
of the social democrats took place at
Brunswick.</p>

<p>“A feeling of dissatisfaction at an
undefined something is constantly
gaining ground in Germany. There
is a yearning after the freedom promised
with the united empire. ‘Germany
is great, but she is not happy!’
This seems to be the condition of the
empire. The revolutions that have
just taken place in France and Spain,
the declaration of the republic, have
had a positive influence in Germany.
The democratic element is again lifting
its head, and a great meeting of
democratic leaders is soon to be held
at Frankfort-on-the-Main, unless it
be prohibited by the authorities.
The Catholic element of the German
population is also in a state of
continual excitement.”</p>

<p>It is with no feeling of pleasure that
these extracts are given here from
such a variety of non-Catholic quarters,
showing the distrust and growing
dislike with which the Prussian
rule is regarded. It is only to show
that Catholics, in battling for their
religion, are only battling for freedom
and the rights of man. The mailed
hand, red already with the life-blood
of three nations, which now smites
the church, will not hesitate to crush
to powder every semblance of freedom
which dares stand in its path.
He who attacks the rights of God
will laugh at the puny rights of man,
simply as man. And you who bow
down before the state; you who set
up this state above you, and surrender
yourselves to it absolutely&mdash;you
have breathed life into the statue of
Frankenstein; you would rid yourselves
of it if you could, but you
have created that which you cannot
destroy, and forged for yourselves an
agent of self-destruction.</p>

<p>Happily, Catholics have faith in a
God above it all. If it has done no
other good, it has brought out to the
eyes of the world, in a wonderful
manner, at once the vastness and
the unity of the Catholic Church.
Two years ago, the cry was: Catholics
will not accept infallibility.
When the Jesuits were driven out
from Germany, the cry was: “Catholic
Germany rejoices.” When the last
remnant of the Papal States was torn
from the Holy Father, the world cried
out: “Now is the Papacy dead.”
When a few disappointed and faithless
men showed their heads in Germany,
with all the power of the throne
at their back, men cried out: “There
is to be a new schism.” What do
they say now?</p>

<p>Part of it has been seen already.
M. John Lemoine, one of the oftenest-quoted
writers of the day, a Protestant,
writes to the anti-Catholic
<i>Journal des Débats</i> on the defeat of
the Irish University Bill: “From the
depths of that palace which he calls
his prison, the now helpless old man
(<i>le vieillard désarmé</i>), who reigns
only over consciences, has just shattered
the most solid government of
Europe (the Gladstone ministry),
and overthrown the greatest minister
of England. We would remark that
never was the Pope more sovereign,
more a dictator, more omnipotent,
than since he has relinquished the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
command of subjects for that of the
faithful only.”</p>

<p>After concluding that the stars in
their courses have fought against Pius
IX., and that his failure is Heaven’s
doom, the London <i>Times</i> says:</p>

<p>“Indoors the whole universe is at
his feet, but he cannot look out of
his windows without seeing a world
in arms against him.... Pius IX.
has done all that devotees could
dream, and suffered all that the world
could accomplish. He has achieved
an absolute dominion over the human
intelligence, and lost every inch
of his temporal power.... We
may concede, we may be even well
content, that he still holds and rules
the most impulsive, the most imaginative,
and the most sentimental
races of the civilized world, and
that he himself is admirably adapted
for that empire over souls....
We envy the Pope his Irish, French,
and Peninsular subjects as little as
we envy them their infallible guide.”</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> forgets the 14,000,000
German “subjects,” as it calls them,
and the other millions outside of the
races it has mentioned. From all it
concludes, however, that “Rome
will be Rome to the end of the
chapter,” and that indeed it would be
a pity that it were not so, though it
ought to change a little with the world.</p>

<p>How, then, stands Rome to-day?
Never more united, though never
did the whole world collect its forces
with greater <i>animus</i> to overwhelm
it. The state in Germany banishes
the Jesuits, and takes infidels to its
bosom; in Spain, it banishes the
Jesuits, and finds in their place the
<i>Descamisados</i>; in Switzerland, it ejects
Mermillod, and embraces Loyson;
in Italy, it imprisons the Pope, and
welcomes Victor Emanuel or Garibaldi:
<i>Non hunc sed Barabbam!</i></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Catholic world
speaks out, and from the ends of the
earth comes back the protest, echoed
from point to point, and gathering
volume as it goes: We protest as
men, we protest as free citizens, we
protest as Christians! Protestation
does little, say some. True, but, if
it has done nothing else, it has at
least silenced the false cry that Catholics
approved of these measures.
Protestation at last tells; and when the
interests of those who are now indifferent
come, as sooner or later
they must come, to be affected by
the policy to-day so successful in
Prussia, our voices and warnings will
be remembered. Catholics cannot
at present take up the sword; they
can only use, then, the weapons at
their disposal&mdash;the voice and the pen.
They must use them unceasingly
and unsparingly until justice is done,
and Catholics are granted the rights
of citizens, which Freemasons are
allowed to enjoy undisturbed. The
rights of the state, whether monarchy
or republic, are sacred in their
eyes, but they live for something
more than the state. All the armies
in the world cannot coerce the free
soul of one man, for they cannot
reach it: it is beyond their province.
There always will be two laws in
this world&mdash;the law of God, and the
law of man. The first is equivalent
to <i>right</i>, the second is not necessarily
so. The difficulty between states
and the Catholic Church lies in the
fact that the states consider <i>legality</i>
synonymous with <i>right</i>, and that
what is legal therefore must commend
itself to the Christian conscience.
Were men ruled by the
law which makes the Catholic proclaim
himself “a Catholic first, and a
nationalist if you will,”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> all difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
would be at an end. We are
Catholics first, because to be a true
Catholic is the truest patriotism, and
the perfection of citizenship; because
to be Catholic is to be Christian,
and all civilized governments draw all
that is sound and good in them from
Christianity, from Christ. When the
state constructs no law which is not
right, then will Lord Denbigh’s famous
sentence have lost its meaning.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Like</span> the Cambrian bards, their
brethren of Armorica sang the triumphs
and misfortunes of their country,
and the deeds of her defenders,
during the twelve centuries that they
were governed by chiefs of their own
race. The great names of Arthur,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
of Morvan Lez-Breiz, of Alan Barbe
Torte, and of Nomenöe, offered
stirring subjects for the inspiration
of the bards. In a former number,
we gave “The March of Arthur,”
of which the original, with the exception
of the last two lines, bears
every stamp of antiquity, and probably
dates from the VIth century.
The epic of “Lez-Breiz,” of which
we proceed to give a translation of
the fragments still extant, is about
two centuries later.</p>

<p>Morvan, Machtiern or Viscount
of Léon, son of a <i>Konan</i>, or crowned
chief, was famous in the IXth century
as one of the maintainers of
Breton independence against the
encroachments of the Franks under
Louis le Débonnaire, and received
from his grateful countrymen the surname
of “Lez” or “Lezou Breiz”&mdash;the
Stay, or the Hammer, of Brittany.</p>

<p>The story of Lez-Breiz, in a weakened
and modified form, exists in
Wales in the fragmentary ballad of
<i>Peredur</i>.</p>

<p class="pc1">II.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">The child ran home in eager haste;<br />
Leapt on his mother’s knee.</p>
<p class="pps6i">‘Ma Mammik, ah! you do not know”<br />
(He said, with boyish glee):</p>

What I have seen to-day!</p>
<p class="pp6i">My lord S. Michael in the church<br />
Is not so grand, so gay.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“A man so bright, so beautiful,<br />
I ne’er before have seen.”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Nay, son, more fair than angels are<br />
No man hath ever been.”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Pardon me, mother, but you err:<br />
These knights (men call them so)</p>
<p class="pp6i">Are fairer. I would be as they,<br />
And after them will go.”</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Then thrice the mother, at these words,<br />
Fell fainting to the ground:</p>
<p class="pp6i">While Morvan to the stable went,<br />
Nor once his head turned round.</p>
<p class="pp6i">A wretched beast he found therein,<br />
Then mounted, and away;</p>
<p class="pp6i">Bidding farewell to none, he sped,<br />
He sped without delay.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">After the noble knight went he,<br />
Urging his steed forlorn</p>

<p class="pc1">THE RETURN.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Marvelled much Sir Morvan Lez-Breiz,<br />
Now a knight renowned;</p>
<p class="pp6i">Famous, among warriors famous<br />
All the country round,&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp6i">Marvelled much Sir Morvan Lez-Breiz,<br />
When, in ten years’ time,</p>
<p class="pp6i">To his home once more returning,<br />
In his manhood’s prime,</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Brambles he beheld, and nettles,<br />
Springing wild and free</p>
<p class="pp6i">In the court and on the threshold,<br />
Desolate to see.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Thickly clung the clustering ivy<br />
O’er the ruined wall,</p>
<p class="pp6i">And a poor, blind, aged woman<br />
Answered to his call.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Canst thou, worthy grandame, give me<br />
Lodging for the night?”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Willingly, my lord, but ‘twill be<br />
Neither fair nor bright.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Ever since the child went wandering,<br />
Wandering far away,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Young and headstrong, has the manor<br />
Fallen to decay.”</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Scarcely had she finished speaking,<br />
When a damsel fair,</p>
<p class="pp6i">When a damsel fair came slowly<br />
Down the broken stair.</p>
<p class="pp6i">And she sadly gazed upon him,<br />
Through her tears she gazed:</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Wherefore, maiden, art thou weeping?”<br />
Lez-Breiz asked, amazed.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Why, my lord knight, I am weeping<br />
Freely will I say:</p>
<p class="pp6i">Of your age I have a brother.<br />
Long since gone away.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Forth he went to be a warrior,<br />
Ten long years ago;</p>
<p class="pp6i">So, whene’er a knight I see, my<br />
Heart is full of woe.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Therefore ever am I weeping<br />
When a knight I see,</p>
<p class="pp6i">For I think, my little brother,<br />
Where, ah! where is he?”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Had you, then, one only brother,<br />
Gentle maiden? say:</p>
<p class="pp6i">And your mother? prithee tell me<br />
Have you none, I pray?”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Have I yet another brother<br />
In the world? Ah! no;</p>
<p class="pp6i">But and if he be in heaven,<br />
That I do not know.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Thither passed away my mother,<br />
Who for sorrow died</p>
<p class="pp6i">When he left us. I have now my<br />
Nurse, and none beside.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“There, beyond the door, my mother’s<br />
Bed you still may see:</p>
<p class="pp6i">And her arm-chair by the hearth-stone,<br />
Where ‘twas wont to be.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Her blest cross I wear&mdash;the only<br />
Comfort left to me.”</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Groaned so deeply Seigneur Lez-Breiz<br />
That the maiden said,</p>
<p class="pp6q">“You, lord knight, have lost a mother?<br />
Your heart, too, has bled?”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Lost my mother have I truly:<br />
Her myself I slew!”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“In the name of heaven, then, sir,<br />
Who and what are you?”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“I am Morvan, son of Konan:<br />
Lez-Breiz named am I,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Sister mine.” The young girl trembled<br />
As one like to die.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Both his arms the brother folded<br />
Round his sister dear,</p>
<p class="pp6i">And the maiden fondly kissed him,<br />
Shedding many a tear.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Long, my brother, have we lost thee,<br />
Since God let thee go;</p>
<p class="pp6i">He again to me has led thee,<br />
Having willed it so.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Blest my brother, blest be he,<br />

Lez-Breiz the Breton knight</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Said Lez-Breiz to his young esquire,<br />
“Awake, my page; arise:</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>And lance, in heedful wise.</p>
<p class="pp6i">To crimson them with Frankish blood<br />
Forth am I fain to go;</p>
<p class="pp6i">By help of heaven and my two arms,<br />
The Franks to leap I’ll show.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Oh! bid me also, my good lord,<br />
Go with you, I implore.”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Ah! what would thy poor mother say,<br />
Shouldst thou return no more?</p>
<p class="pp6i">If on the ground thy blood should flow,<br />
Who then would be her stay?”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Oh! if you love me, my good lord,<br />
You will not say me nay.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“But let me follow in the fight;<br />
The Franks I do not fear:</p>
<p class="pp6i">My heart is firm; my steel is sharp<br />
And true, my master dear.</p>
<p class="pp6i">And let who list lay blame on me,<br />
Where you go, there go I;</p>
<p class="pp6i">And where you fight, there I will fight,<br />
Whether I live or die.”</p>

<p class="pc1">II.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Forth to the combat Lez-Breiz went,<br />
With his young page, till he</p>
<p class="pp6i">Came to S. Anne of Armor, when<br />
Into the church went he.</p>
<p class="pp6q">“O blesséd lady, sweet S. Anne,<br />
In youth to thee I came</p>
<p class="pp6i">To pay my homage, and to crave<br />
The shelter of thy name.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“I had not reached my twenty years,<br />
Yet twenty fights had seen,</p>
<p class="pp6i">And every one, O lady blest,<br />
Won by thine aid had been.</p>
<p class="pp6i">If to my own land yet again<br />
It may be granted me</p>
<p class="pp6i">Safe to return, I give this gift,<br />
Mother S. Anne, to thee:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“With cord of wax encompassed thrice<br />
These very walls shall be;</p>
<p class="pp6i">Thrice round the churchyard and the church,<br />
When I my home shall see.</p>
<p class="pp6i">And I will offer thee, S. Anne,<br />
A goodly banner fair</p>
<p class="pp6i">Of velvet and white satin wrought,<br />
And staff of ivory rare.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And likewise seven silver bells<br />
Shall in the belfry swing,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Which merrily above thy head<br />
By night and day shall ring.</p>
<p class="pp6i">And for thy holy-water stoup,<br />
Thrice on my knees I’ll go,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Water to fetch from where the stream<br />
Doth clearest, purest flow.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Go, Lez-Breiz, fearless to the fight,<br />
I will be with thee, noble knight.”</p>

<p class="pc1">III.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Hear ye? ‘Tis Lez-Breiz who arrives:<br />
He comes, ye need not doubt,</p>
<p class="pp6i">With goodly number in his rear<br />
Of steel-clad warriors stout.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Hold! on a small white ass he rides,<br />
Bridled with hempen cord;</p>
<p class="pp6i">And all his suite one little page<br />
Who followeth his lord!</p>
<p class="pp6i">And yet he is a mighty man<br />
As any that draw sword.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Now, when the squire of Lez-Breiz saw<br />
Them onward nearer ride,</p>
<p class="pp6i">He closer pressed and closer to<br />
The knight his master’s side.</p>
<p class="pp6q">“See you, my lord? ‘Tis Lorgnez comes,<br />
And with him warriors ten,</p>
<p class="pp6i">And ten surround him as he rides,<br />
Followed again by ten.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Round by the chestnut woods they come:<br />
Alas, my master dear,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Against such fearful odds to fight<br />
Will cost us much, I fear.”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“When once they taste my polished steel,<br />
Then thou fell soon shalt see,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Though now they number thirty men,<br />
How many left will be.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Strike against mine thy sword, my page,<br />
Then march we forward, and engage.”</p>

<p class="pc1">IV.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Ha! Chevalier Lez-Breiz: good-day to thee.”</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“Ha! Chevalier Lorgnez: the same from me.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Is it alone thou comest to the fight?”</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“Nay, sooth, I am not come alone, sir knight:<br />
S. Anne herself is with me, lady bright.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“I from the king come forth to-day:<br />
He bids me take thy life away.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Thy king I scorn, as I scorn thee,<br />
Thy sword, and all thine armed menie:<br />
Return ‘mid womankind to be,<br />
And wear gilt garments gallantly<br />
At Paris; and begone from me!</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Sir Lez-Breiz, say to me, I pray,<br />
In what wood saw you first the day?<br />
The meanest serf that eats my bread<br />
Shall make your helm leap off your head.”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Then Lez-Breiz swift his good sword drew:</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“The son shall make full well to rue<br />
Him who the father never knew.”</p>

<p class="pc1">V.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">In friendly wise the hermit spake,<br />
As at his door he stood&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp6i">To the young page of Lez-Breiz spake<br />
The hermit of the wood:</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Thou speed’st apace the forest through,<br />
Thine armor dashed with blood:</p>
<p class="pp6q">Come to my hermitage, my child,<br />
Come in for rest and food;</p>
<p class="pp6q">Come in and wash thy stains away.”<br />
Thus spake that hermit good.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Nay, father, this is not the time<br />
For me to eat or rest:</p>
<p class="pp6q">A fountain in all haste I seek<br />
At my poor lord’s behest.</p>
<p class="pp6q">So sorely is my master spent<br />
With most unequal strife</p>
<p class="pp6q">That well it is from this affray<br />
That he escapes with life.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Lie thirteen knights, Sir Lorgnez first,<br />
Beneath him, slain to-day;</p>
<p class="pp6q">And I as many overcame:<br />
The rest all ran away.”</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Breton at heart he had not been<br />
Who had not laughed to see</p>
<p class="pp6i">The green grass red with Frankish blood,<br />
As red as it could be;</p>
<p class="pp6i">While near the slain sate Lord Lez-Breiz,<br />
Resting him wearily.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">And he had been no Christian, sure<br />
Who wept not to behold</p>
<p class="pp6i">The tears from Lez-Breiz’ eyes that fell,<br />
And dropped upon the mould,</p>
<p class="pp6i">All in the church of good S. Anne,<br />
Where, on his bended knee,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Weeping he thanked the patroness<br />
Of his own Brittany.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Mother S. Anne, all thanks to you,<br />
All thanks to you I give:</p>

Still, thanks to you, I live.”</p>

<p class="pc1">VII.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">This combat fierce to keep in mind<br />
Is sung this goodly song;</p>
<p class="pp6i">In honor of the brave Lez-Breiz<br />

<p class="pc reduct">THE MOOR OF THE KING.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Said to his lords the Frankish king,<br />
The Frankish king one day:</p>
<p class="pp6q">“True homage he will render who<br />
For me shall Lez-Breiz slay.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Naught doth he but my warriors kill,<br />
And aye, with all his might,</p>
<p class="pp6i">My power withstands, nor ceaseth he<br />
Against me still to fight.”</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Now, when the king’s Moor heard these words,<br />
Before the king spake he:</p>
<p class="pp6q">“True homage have I rendered oft<br />
And pledge of loyalty;</p>
<p class="pp6i">But since another pledge you crave<br />
And warranty, O sire,</p>
<p class="pp6i">The knight Lez-Breiz shall furnish me<br />
With that which you desire.</p>
<p class="pp6i">And if to-morrow I should fail<br />
Sir Lez-Breiz’ head to bring,</p>
<p class="pp6i">With pleasure offer I mine own<br />
Unto my lord the king.”</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Now, scarcely had the morrow dawned,<br />
When swift the young squire ran</p>
<p class="pp6i">To find his master. “O my lord!’<br />
(The trembling page began,)</p>
<p class="pp6q">“The giant Moor defiance flings<br />
Against my lord to-day.”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Defiance? be it so: I’ll answer<br />
Him as best I may.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Ah! my dear lord, then know you not<br />
He fights with demon charms?”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“He doth? Then Heaven’s aid be ours,<br />
And blessing on our arms.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Haste thee, equip my good black steed,<br />
Whilst I my armor don.”</p>
<p class="pp6q">“Pardon, my lord, your charger black<br />
You will not fight upon.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Within the royal stables stand<br />
Three steeds, and from the three</p>
<p class="pp6i">One must you choose: pray listen to<br />
A secret thing from me.</p>
<p class="pp6i">I learnt it from an ancient clerk,<br />
Right holy, sooth, was he,</p>
<p class="pp6i">A man of good and saintly ways,<br />
If any such there be.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Do not thou take the charger white,<br />
Nor yet take thou the bay,</p>
<p class="pp6i">But the black steed between them both<br />
Take forth and lead away;</p>
<p class="pp6i">For that the king’s own Moor himself<br />
Hath tamed with his own hand:</p>
<p class="pp6i">Trust me, and mount it when you go<br />
The giant to withstand.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And when into the royal hall<br />
The Moor shall enter, he</p>
<p class="pp6i">Will throw his mantle on the ground:<br />
Let yours suspended be:</p>
<p class="pp6i">If under his your garment lay,<br />
Doubled his might would be.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">When the black giant draws anear,<br />
Then fail not with your lance</p>
<p class="pp6i">To make the sign of holy cross,<br />
Or ever he advance.</p>
<p class="pp6i">And when he rushes full of rage<br />
And fury on my lord,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Receive him on its point, the lance<br />
Will break not, trust my word.</p>
<p class="pp6i">By aid of heaven and your two arms,<br />
Naught will avail his paynim charms.”</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">By aid of Heaven and his two arms,<br />
The trusty lance brake not</p>
<p class="pp6i">When they against each other rode<br />
In fierce encounter hot:</p>
<p class="pp6i">When in the hall they dashed amain<br />
To onset, breast to breast,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Steel against steel, as lightning swift,<br />
With lances firm in rest.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">The Frankish king sat on his throne,<br />
’Mid lords of high degree,</p>
<p class="pp6i">To watch the fight. “Hold firm,” he said,<br />
“Black Raven of the Sea!</p>
<p class="pp6i">Courage! hold firm, thou Raven bold,<br />
And plume this <i>merle</i> for me.”</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Then, as the tempest breaks upon<br />
The corsair, so the Moor,</p>
<p class="pp6i">With furious might and giant weight,<br />
Down upon Lez-Breiz bore;</p>
<p class="pp6i">His lance in thousand splinters flew,<br />
And, with one mighty bound,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Unhorsed by that dread shock, he fell<br />
And rolled upon the ground.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">And when they found themselves afoot,<br />
Then each, with all his might,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Fell on the other furiously<br />
In close and deadly fight.</p>
<p class="pp6i">The sword-strokes, falling thick as hail,<br />
Rang through the palace halls,</p>
<p class="pp6i">With sounding blows upon the mail<br />
That shook the very walls.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">At every clashing of their arms<br />
A thousand sparks leapt out,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Like red-hot iron from the forge,<br />
Beaten by armorer stout.</p>
<p class="pp6i">At last, through one unguarded joint,<br />
The Breton’s sword made way</p>
<p class="pp6i">And pierced the giant’s heart. He fell,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>And bled his life away.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Forthwith, when Morvan Lez-Breiz saw<br />
His Moorish foe lie dead,</p>
<p class="pp6i">His foot he placed upon his breast,<br />
And straight cut off his head.</p>
<p class="pp6i">He hung it by the grisly beard<br />
His saddle-bow unto;</p>
<p class="pp6i">And, for its stains of Moorish blood,<br />
His sword away he threw.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">Upon his good steed then he sprang,<br />
He sprang without delay,</p>
<p class="pp6i">And, followed by his page, went forth<br />
Upon his homeward way.</p>
<p class="pp6i">When home, he hung aloft,<br />
Upon his gateway high,</p>
<p class="pp6i">The hideous head with grinning teeth<br />
In sight of passers-by.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">And now the warriors said, Behold!<br />
A mighty man indeed</p>
<p class="pp6i">Is Lez-Breiz, stay of Brittany<br />
In every time of need.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Whereto Lord Lez-Breiz answered straight:<br />
“I twenty fights have seen,</p>

A peal of thunder dread</p>
<p class="pp6i">Rolls through the echoing skies, and breaks<br />
Above Sir Lez-Breiz’ head.</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">His gentle squire lent anxious heed<br />

Any who his form had seen</p>
<p class="pp6i">Had a hoary oak-tree thought him,<br />

<p class="pp6i">None who Lez-Breiz met had known him,<br />

<p class="pp6i p1">One there was alone who knew him<br />
Through the wood a lady bright,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Through the greenwood swiftly passing,<br />
Clad in garb of purest white,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Stayed her steps and wept, beholding<br />
Lez-Breiz in so piteous plight.</p>

Lez-Breiz, is it thou indeed?</p>

<p class="pp6i p1">A month and seven years had flown,<br />
When Lez-Breiz’ faithful squire</p>

</div>

<p class="p1">Of the two warriors mentioned in
the poem, the first is unknown except
under the opprobrious epithet of
“Lorgnez,” or “the leper.” The
“Moor of the King” appears to
have been one of those whom Louis
took captive, after having conquered
the city of Barcelona, and retained
in his service. With regard to the
avenging of his master’s death by
the esquire, tradition relates that, at
the moment when a Frankish warrior
named Cosl struck off the Breton’s
head, the esquire of Morvan
pierced his back with a mortal wound.
According to Ermold Nigel, a Frankish
monk who accompanied the
army of Louis, the head of Morvan
was carried to the monk Witchar,
who, when he had washed away the
blood and combed the hair, recognized
the features to be those of Lez-Breiz.
He also relates that the body
was carried away by the Franks, and
that Louis le Débonnaire thought
proper himself to arrange the ceremonies
for its sepulture, doubtless with
the intent to guard his tomb from
the rebellious piety of the Bretons.
The popular belief declared, as it
has done with regard to other heroes,
and in other lands, that from his unknown
grave he should one day
awake, and restore to his country
the independence of which his death
had deprived her. Seven years after
the death of Morvan and the consequent
subjugation of Brittany, Guiomarc’h,
another viscount of Leon, of
the race of Lez-Breiz, in 818 again
roused his country to arms, and, after
a vigorous struggle, succeeded in
throwing off the foreign domination
so hateful to his countrymen.</p>

<p>Nomenöe, one of the most astute
as well as determined of the Breton
kings, after deceiving Charles le
Chauve for some time by a feigned
submission, suddenly threw off the
mask, drove the Franks beyond the
Oust and Vilaine, seized the cities
of Nantes and Rennes&mdash;which have
ever since formed a part of Brittany&mdash;and
delivered his countrymen
from the tribute which they had been
compelled to pay to the French
king. M. Augustin Thierry considers
the following description of the
event which occasioned the deliverance
of Brittany to be “a poem of
remarkable beauty, full of allusions
to manners of a remote epoch, ...
and a vividly symbolical picture of the
prolonged inaction and the sudden
awakening of the patriot prince
when he judged the right moment
to have come.”</p>

<p>The fierce exultation of the poet
when the head of the Intendant is
swept off to complete the lacking
weight, recalls the words of Lez-Breiz
not many years before: “Can I but
see this Frankish king, he shall have
what he asks. I will pay tribute
with my sword!”</p>

Mildew and mist for the space of three weeks have passed o’er us,<br />
Mildew and mist from the land that lies over the mountains:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Still from the land of the Franks, more and more, thickly driving,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>So that in no wise my eyes can behold him returning,<br />
Karo, my son, for whose coming from thence I am watching.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Tell me, good merchant, who travellest all the land over,<br />
Hast thou no tidings to tell me of him, my son Karo?”<br />
“May be so, Father of Arez, but where and what does he?”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“He, wise of head, strong of heart, with the chariots departed,<br />
Drawn by three horses abreast, into Rennes with the tribute,<br />
Bearing among them the toll in full weight of the Bretons.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Chief, if your son bore the tribute, in vain you expect him:<br />
Each hundred pounds’ weight of silver was found to be lacking,<br />
Lacking by three when they weighed it: whereon the Intendant</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Cried out, ‘O vassal, thy head shall make up the scant measure!’<br />
Straight, with his sword swept his head off, and then, by the long hair<br />
Taking it up, he has thrown it down into the balance.”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Hearing these tidings, the aged chief fell, nigh to swooning,<br />
Heavily fell on the rock, with his long white hair hiding,<br />
Hiding his face, groaning, “Karo, my son! my son Karo!”</p>

<p class="pc1">II.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">The aged chief is journeying with all his kith and kin,<br />
Till he to Nomenöe’s castle strong the way doth win.</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“Say, porter at the castle gate, your lord, is he at home?”</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“Or be it so, or be it not, to him may no harm come!”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">E’en as he spake, his lord came riding through the portal strong,<br />
Returning from the chase, his fierce hounds scouring swift along;<br />
His bow he carried in his hand, and o’er his shoulder slung<br />
A wild boar of the forest, huge, all dead and bleeding, hung.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Good-day to you, brave mountaineers, and father, first to thee.<br />
What tidings bring you, or what is it you would ask of me?”</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“We come to learn if Justice lives&mdash;if God in heaven there be:<br />
We come to learn if still there is a chief in Brittany.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Sure, I believe that God in heaven ever dwells on high;<br />
And, so far as I can be, chief of Brittany am I.”</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“Who <i>will</i> be, <i>can</i>; and he who can will drive the Franks away,<br />
Will chase the Franks, defend the land, vengeance on vengeance pay.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“My son and me he will avenge: the living and the dead:<br />
Karo, my child, from whom the Franks have stricken off his head.<br />
The excommunicated Franks, who pity know nor truth,<br />
Have slain him in the early flower and beauty of his youth.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“His head, so fair with golden hair, they threw to make the weight,<br />
They threw it in the balance, and have left me desolate.”<br />
Then thick and fast the tears fell from the father’s aged eyes,<br />
And glittered down his long and silvery beard in piteous wise;<br />
They sparkled like the morning dew upon the aspen white,<br />
When earliest sunbeams wake them into gems of quiv’ring light.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">When Nomenöe that beheld, a fearful oath he swore:</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“By this boar’s head, and by the dart wherewith I pierced the boar,<br />
I swear my country to avenge ere many hours be o’er:<br />
Nor will I wash away the blood from thee, my crimsoned hand,<br />
Till I have washed the bleeding wounds of thee, my injured land.”</p>

<p class="pc1">III.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">The thing which Nomenöe did no chief hath done before:<br />
With sacks to fill with pebble-stones he went down to the shore:<br />
Pebbles and flints for tribute to the bald-head Frankish king:<br />
No chief but only Nomenöe e’er hath done this thing.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">He shod his horse with silver shoes, turned backwards every one,<br />
And he himself to pay the tribute forth to Rennes is gone,<br />
Prince that he is: no chief but he did ever this before,<br />
And never chief will do the like again for evermore.</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Ho, warden! open wide your gates! wide open let them be,<br />
That I may enter into Rennes as it beseemeth me.<br />
Hither come I, Lord Nomenöe, bringing store of gold:<br />
My chariots all are filled therewith as full as they can hold.”</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Descend, O chief! my lord, descend, and enter in, I pray;<br />
Enter the castle, and command your chariots here to stay,<br />
And in the hands of your esquires your white steed leave below,<br />
While you ascend to supper; but you first would wash, I trow:<br />
Hark! even now to horn the water<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> do the cornets blow.”</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>The first sack brought they, well tied up, the weight in full it made.<br />
The second sack was eke the same, and then the third they threw<br />
Into the scales. Oh! oh! there lacks the weight that here is due!</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">When the Intendant that beheld, quick stretched he forth his hands<br />
All eagerly upon the sack, to loose the knotted bands.</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“Hold! Sir Intendant, I will cut the fastening with my sword.”<br />
And swift it from the scabbard leapt ere he had said the word.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Upon the crouching Frank it fell, it fell with might and main,<br />
Clean from his shoulders swept his head, and cut the balance chain.<br />
Then rolled the head the scales into, and weighed the balance down.</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“Stop the assassin&mdash;stop!” they cried all wildly through the town.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">He flies! he flies! The torches bring; haste! follow him with speed!</p>
<p class="ppn6q">“Ha! bring your links to light my way&mdash;the night is dark indeed.<br />
The night is dark, the road is ice: ‘twill spoil your gilded shoes<br />
Of leather blue so fair bedecked, and ye your toil shall lose;<br />
For ne’er again your scales of gold shall you, for evermore,<br />
Use to weigh flints from Brittany and pebbles from her shore.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c545" id="c545">KOCHE, KING OF PITT.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Koche</span>, the subject of this memoir,
was born on the remote island of Chatham,
in the Southern Pacific Ocean.
Forced by a cruel servitude to fly from
his native island, he passed many
years in absolute solitude on the little
uninhabited island of Pitt, lying some
miles distant from Chatham. Here he
reigned undisputed master of the land
and all it contained: whence the title
of “King of Pitt” among those who
knew him. His account of his native
island and its inhabitants, together
with his own adventures, show
him to have been a man of an undaunted
spirit, which no adverse fortune
could bend, much less break;
and had he been known to Carlyle,
would have been placed by him
among his heroes for worship and
imitation; but, unluckily, Carlyle
never heard of him.</p>

<p>It is well, in order to understand
the life and adventures of Koche,
“King of Pitt,” to relate the history
of the country and people from which
he sprang, before going into the details
of his career.</p>

<p>Ware-kauri, one of the South Sea
islands, called by the English, Chatham,
lies several hundred miles to
the eastward of New Zealand. Its
history up to the year 1791 rests
upon tradition, as prior to that date
its inhabitants had not acquired,
among their many accomplishments,
the art of letters. Koche himself,
from whose mouth this narrative has
been taken, says that his people were
from the earliest period inclined to
peaceful pursuits, and subsisted
chiefly upon fish and seal; that
they enjoyed a democracy, and conducted
their simple affairs by a council
of notable men. He did not
hesitate, however, to acknowledge
that when at long intervals, covering
a generation, a high and prolonged
west wind drove a canoe-load of
New Zealanders upon their shores,
they forthwith and without ceremony
slew them. But he justified
this departure from their ordinary
habits on the ground of public
policy; as, had they received them
in charity, and pursued the peaceful
tenor of their way, their involuntary
visitors would have ended by slaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
and, moreover, devouring them;
the first party of this sort who landed
on the island having made it distinctly
understood that men and
women were their favorite articles of
diet. But among themselves, the
taking of life, he said, was unknown;
and why should it not be, since
they were not fond of men, as some
people were, and never suffered for
want of food; and on the sea-shore
they found plenty of seal and birds,
and, in the marshes and lakes of the
interior, fish and fowl in abundance?
No! the race of the Tuïti, his forefathers,
were no man-eaters; they
had become “missionaries,” or Christian,
in the days of his father, and remained
so ever since, such of them
as had not been devoured or driven
to death by the hated Zealander&mdash;at
whose name his black eye flashed
fire&mdash;who had made a slave-pen and
shambles of his once happy island.</p>

<p>Their tradition goes back to a first
pair, man and woman, who appeared
on the Isle of Rangi-haute, a score
of miles to the southeast, called by
the English, Pitt. It is a solitary
volcanic mountain, lifting its truncated
summit above the waters of the
South Sea, whose waves have beaten
in vain for untold centuries upon its
rock-bound base. How the first pair
came is unknown; whether brought
by the Spirit from above, or created
on the mountain, none could tell;
the time was remote, and tradition
was confused in going back to the
origin of the human race, to the beginning
of the world; the memory
of man did not run beyond the apparition
on Rangi-haute.</p>

<p>But the history of the couple and
of their children is handed down in
the following legend: They lived
upon the top of the mountain, from
whence they caught and worshipped
the first ray of the morning sun, and
bowed in adoration to that luminary
as he sank beneath the western wave.
The ground was held sacred; and
their descendants in after-days consecrated
like spots, devoted alone to
prayer and propitiation, on which
no article of dress even could be
placed, and from the desecration
of one of which arose the destruction
of the race.</p>

<p>Trees clothed the slopes of the
mountain, and everywhere among
them, planted by the beneficent
hand of the Creator, rose the karaka
(bread-fruit) laden with golden fruit&mdash;the
sole food of man, and source
of perpetual youth and health. In
after-days, it turned acrid, and fatal
to life, until the pitying Creator
taught his children, by immersion in
boiling water and a running stream,
to restore it in a measure to its pristine
state.</p>

<p>One day, a youth wandered down
to the sea-shore among the birds
that lined the rocks, and, seating himself
near where an eagle was perched
pluming his wing, they fell into
conversation. The eagle complained
that they could no longer soar
into the high air, by reason of a
spell cast over his tribe he believed
by the Tuïti; his progenitors, he
said, had sailed over the mountain
at will, and preyed upon the living
mako-mako, or honey-eater and the
tuïs, or mocking-bird; while he
could fly only in the heavy air along
the beach, and was compelled to
consort with sea-fowl, who held him
in contempt; and to feed on garbage.
The youth answered that the
blood of the honey-eater and the
mocking-bird had cried to the Creator,
and brought down upon the
eagle his banishment. The Tuïti
warred neither with the Maker nor his
children; they fed on fruit, and shed
no blood: the eagle had banished
himself. The king of birds, avoiding
the issue, replied that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
great island to the northwest, which
his friend had doubtless seen from
the mountain, the woods were filled
with beautiful birds, and fruit of
every color, hanging over the dark,
transparent waters of many lakes,
while here&mdash;what a poor place!
One solitary mountain, no lakes, and
no fruit, save the karaka, which,
sweet as it was, was bitter compared
with the fruit which grew in the west.
There was no man upon it to rule
the great island. It called aloud
for a master&mdash;a son of Tuïti&mdash;to go
over. The youth listened to the
tempter, and ambition elated his
soul; he arose from the rock, and
asked to be shown the path that led
over the water. The eagle, looking
at him askance, promised him wings
to fly over, provided he would first
render an easy service by taking
him to the top of the mountain.
On hearing this, the youth cast himself
upon his face on the sand,
trembling; where he lay for hours
torn by the conflict between the good
spirit of obedience, and the evil one
of ambition, as they warred within
him for the mastery. As the sun
sank, his guardian angel fled discomfited,
and he rose to his feet with a
shudder, and, taking the eagle on his
wrist, ascended the mountain, and in
the dark cast him loose in the forbidden
field. All night long the
flutter and death-cry of birds smote
upon his ear, and, when morning
dawned, the song of the mako was
mute, and the tuïs had ceased to mock.</p>

<p>The people assembled in alarm. A
child to whom its mother had given
fruit fell dead; they gathered about
its body in terror. The eagle hovered
over them, and uttered his war-cry.
The conscience-striken youth confessed.
The day was passed in penitence
and sorrow about the body of
the child in the lap of its wailing
mother. Hunger assailed them; they
burned the remains on a funeral-pyre
built of the fragrant kalamu,
and, descending the mountain, fed
upon the root of the fern, and drank
from the living spring.</p>

<p>The youth wandered by the shore,
alone, stung with remorse, and, meeting
the eagle, was taught by him to
construct the korari, the model of
all canoes, made in the likeness of
a sledge, with a wicker-work of
tough creepers, having a false bottom
filled with buoyant kelp. He
put to sea with his family, and landed
on Ware-kauri, which he found, as
the eagle had said, uninhabited by
man, a continent in size compared
to Rangi-haute; with undulating,
fertile plains to the south, and lofty
mountains in the north, sparkling
with lakes of dark transparent water,
and vocal with the song and bright
with the plumage of birds. Filled
with new joy, he sent back tidings to
his kinsmen, and was followed by
successive emigrations, until Rangi-haute
was deserted save by a timid
few who feared the sea. Thus came
about the settlement of Ware-kauri:
and to this extent is the tradition of
the people.</p>

<p>From this time on they had lived
in single families, or in companies
of two or three, moving from place
to place as food became less plentiful,
or as fancy or a love of change
dictated; being careful, in pitching
their new and fragile habitations, not
to crowd upon established groups.
In the sealing season, the families of
the interior came down to the coast,
and laid in from the rocks and reefs
a supply of meat and skins; and
when fishing on the shore became
dull, or the birds wild with much
hunting, the people of the sea bundled
up their effects, and moved to
the interior lakes, chiefly to the great
Tewanga, filled with fish, and covered
with wild fowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span></p>

<p>They dressed in cloaks of sealskin.
Their only weapon of offence or defence
was a club, seldom used except
in killing a seal. Tattooing was
unknown. No ornaments were in
use. The teeth of deceased relatives
were burned with their bodies, not
worn about the neck and wrist, as in
New Zealand, where they commit
the absurdity of placing the departed
in a sitting posture in wooden boxes,
after abstracting their teeth to deck
the survivors, in the name of religion.
The Tuïti burned their dead to avoid
the fearful idea of prolonged decay.
Man springs from the earth as the
flower springs: they return him to
his mother, as the fall fires, sweeping
over the plain, return the flower; she
drinks in with the rain the ashes of
her children, man and flower, and
sends them forth again after a season
of repose to reign over and to beautify
the land. The songs of the women
were plaintive and sweet, rivalling
those of the honey-eater, the mako-mako,
who sang of love, and of the
tuïs, or mocking-bird, that mimicked
from every tree and bush, and filled
the island with its false but beautiful
notes.</p>

<p>Thus had lived the race in peace
and plenty for centuries beyond their
simple means of computation, and
thus were living, fearing no evil from
without, save the landing of a stray
storm-driven canoe from Zealand,
when, towards the end of the last
century, the sloop-of-war <i>Discovery</i>
and its armed tender <i>Chatham</i>, commanded
by Vancouver, made a voyage
of discovery around the world,
by command of his majesty. The
<i>Chatham</i>, Captain William Henry
Broughton, separated in a storm from
her consort, discovered the island
on Nov. 29, 1791, and took possession
of it with the customary ceremonies,
in the name of his majesty, as
first discoverer.</p>

<p>Broughton, as he approached the
coast, saw a continued white sandbeach
interspersed with cliffs of reddish
clay, and mixed with black
rocks. The country appeared very
pleasant, with clearings here and
there, and smoke arising above the
trees. With his glass he perceived
some people hauling up a canoe, and
proceeded to the shore in a cutter.
The natives, seated on the beach, invited
the party to land, and approached
and saluted them by meeting
noses; and with great noise entered
into an animated but unintelligible
conversation by signs, gestures, and
speech. They were a cheerful race,
the conversation of the English frequently
exciting them to bursts of
laughter. The young wore feathers
in their hair, and a few among them
a necklace of mother-of-pearl. All
were cleanly and neatly dressed. The
woods, which grew in a luxuriant
manner, afforded delightful shade,
free of low limbs and underbrush,
and in many places were formed into
arbors by bending and interlacing
the branches when young. The soil
was rich, and the forests and beach
alive with birds of various species,
which appeared as though never
molested.</p>

<p>The surprise of the islanders, their
exclamations, and admiration on beholding
the strangers, could hardly
be imagined. They pointed to the
sun and then to Broughton, and inquired
if he came from thence. In
answer he gave them a dead bird,
pointed out the cause of its death,
fired his gun, and advanced upon
them. All fled to the wood excepting
one man, who stood his ground
and offered battle. War was proclaimed.
The hero was reinforced,
and the sailors fell back to the beach,
followed by fourteen men, armed with
spears or driftwood picked up as
they advanced. “When abreast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
the boat,” says Broughton, “they became
clamorous, talked loud to each
other, and surrounded us. A young
man strutted towards me in a menacing
attitude, distorted his person,
turned up his eyes, and made hideous
faces and fierce gestures. As
the boat came in, they began the
attack. We fired. Johnson’s musket
was knocked from his hand by a
club. Our men were forced into the
water, when the boat’s crew opened
upon them and they fled, save one
who fell on the beach with a ball
through his breast. As we pushed
off, a man came out of the woods,
sat down by the deceased, and in a
dismal howl uttered his lamentation.”
He explains that in making the boast
which brought on hostilities he merely
wished to show the natives the
superior effect of his firearms. This
may be so, or it may be that in the
laborious process of confirming his
majesty’s title to the island, and
in order to make assurance doubly
sure, he had emptied more bottles to
his majesty’s health than was good
for him, and had fired to astonish
the natives. Be this as it may, it
was deeply to be regretted that the
answer to a question indicating such
deep respect should have been a
warlike demonstration. But the Saxon
knows but one way to colonize,
and that leads the aborigines “into
the blind cave of eternal night.”</p>

<p>The father of Koche told him that
as the ship was leaving the shore
the atmosphere became dark, sultry,
and gloomy, and thunder and lightning
descended the mountain and
pursued the retreating strangers into
the sea. Meantime, the dead man
lay on the white beach with a bullet
through his heart. Civilization had
paid the Tuïti its first visit.</p>

<p>A council was held, and the fact
that the slain was not carried off was
considered proof that “the children
of the sun” were not cannibals, and
by some doubts were expressed as
to their intent in landing. It was
concluded, in the event of their return,
to meet them with an emblem of
peace. Accordingly, when in after
years a sealer entered the bay of
Waitangi and its boat touched the
sands, the natives laid down their
spears and clubs, a man advanced
and placed one end of a grass plant
in the hands of the captain, and, holding
on to the other, made him a
speech of welcome, threw over him
his own cloak, and thus established
a firm and lasting peace; and from
thenceforward the fishermen who
frequented the coast found them hospitable,
cheerful friends, and willing
assistants in their labor, and “love
between them flourished like the
palm.”</p>

<p>On the quarter-deck of an American
vessel traversing the Pacific
Ocean, and chiefly at night, Koche
related the sorrows of his race, the
private and public wrongs that had
reduced the Tuïti to a handful of
slaves. Of his own mistreatment he
made little account, relating his personal
oppression in a spirit of fun
and bravado, relieved occasionally
by a flash of hate. In calm weather
his broken narrative ran tersely, and
was marked by humor and a lack of
strong feeling; but when the storm-spirit
arose, and washed the lower
deck and enveloped the upper in
spray, his voice grew hoarse, his eye
flashed, and his white teeth from
time to time came together with a
clash that made the blood tingle.</p>

<p>He said that one summer, about
eighteen years before, a vessel in
search of seal anchored in the small
oval bay of Pohaute, overlooked by the
Maunga Wakai Pai, a volcanic pyramid,
the loftiest on the island, at the
base of which he lived. With his
family and friends, he went down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
greet the new-comers, when, to the
surprise of every one, there landed
among the white men a New Zealand
chief armed to the teeth. His
hair, carefully combed and oiled, was
tied up on the crown of his head,
and surrounded by a fillet of white
feathers, and from his ears protruded
bunches of soft down. Evidently a
man of power, accustomed to command,
he inspired a mysterious
dread, and would have been slain
but for the protection he was under.
The future darkened as he walked
the beach, questioning the people on
their politics and religion, manners
and customs; and it was long remembered
that he highly commended
the veneration they entertained
for sacred places, and walked off
musing when in answer to his inquiry
one was pointed out. It was
Mate-oro, chief of the Nga-te Motunga,
who had lately been defeated
in battle by the Waï Kato, and
driven with his tribe from the valley
of the Komimi to the coast of New
Zealand, from whence he had embarked
for Ware-kauri, and appeared
among the simple inhabitants
as Satan in Paradise&mdash;the forerunner
of troops of fiends.</p>

<p>A red bluff beetled over the bay&mdash;a
conglomerate of particles of colored
clay, cemented by a carbonate of lime,
embedded with dark shining nodules
of iron, and traversed by dikes
of basaltic lava. Its summit was sacred.
One morning before sunrise,
a native ascended to offer his devotions,
and was horror-struck on beholding
in the holy field an iron pot.
He sped down to communicate the
startling intelligence, and returned
with a party of thirteen to verify
the reported sacrilege. Koche, who
was of the number, threw off his
cloak, tore up a fragment of rock,
and dashed the profane utensil to
pieces. A party of sailors, with a
couple of bull-dogs, guided by Mate-oro,
pursued and overtook them.
He shot dead one who turned and
attempted an explanation; the remaining
twelve were bound and
hung by the feet from a tree, head
downward, until nearly dead. The
chief returned to New Zealand, assembled
his people, represented the
island as fertile and full of unarmed
slaves, and recommended its subjugation.
The brig <i>Lord Rodney</i>,
taking her pay in pigs, potatoes, and
flax (and flame, later on!), in two
trips landed the tribe, numbering
eight hundred, on the fated isle.
The natives offered no resistance to
their fierce invaders armed with firelocks,
and were duly parcelled out
among their conquerors, and condemned
to hard labor for life. No
idea of moderation in the amount exacted
was entertained. In a short
time, they furnished thirty vessels
annually with supplies. But the
race began rapidly to run out, with
bent backs and paralytic limbs.
Skulls on the beach, pierced by musket
balls or battered by clubs, told a
tale to visitors their tyrants could not
deny. Valuable as was their labor,
in drunken orgies they were slain for
food.</p>

<p>Once cheerful, full of mirth and
laughter, they became morose and
taciturn. Koche, with many others,
persistently refused to work; some
died under, others yielded to, the
lash; and he, who had been dragged
by a rope to the field, and beaten in
vain, and would neither yield nor give
up the ghost, was taken by the chief
to his house to break in. He continued
moody, and maintained his independence
so far as to execute only
such commissions as pleased him,
frequently courting death by mutely
and stubbornly refusing to obey
orders. Mate-oro seemed to respect
his attitude to some extent, and employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
him to supply his table with
sea-fish, giving him a canoe furnished
with nets and lines for the purpose.
The struggle between them now
ceased, for this occupation gave
Koche solitude and freedom when
afloat, and opportunity to muse over
the condition of himself and people.
He soon came to the conclusion that
it was useless to attempt an insurrection,
the population being unarmed,
dispirited, and under an iron subjugation.
But for his single self, he
was resolved on resistance to the last,
and, as his boat tossed on the wave,
he brooded over many schemes for
the destruction of his would-be master.
A personal conflict was most
in accordance with his disposition,
and many a time he was tempted,
unarmed as he was, to close in a
death-struggle, out of which, doubtless,
he would have come victorious,
if uninterrupted; for though but little
above the middle height, he was
broad and deep-chested, with sinews
of iron, and capable of immense exertion;
and, above all, was animated
by a spirit that would have revelled
in the fight. But followed as the
chief was, fair play was not to be
looked for, and he reluctantly abandoned
his favored purpose. His
thoughts often wandered to the cradle
of his race, now uninhabited, to
which he had made a visit with his
father in youth, where he felt assured
he would find a harbor of refuge, if
Mate-oro could be first despatched.
Whilst in the midst of such reflections
one afternoon, he drew up from
the ocean a fish seldom taken&mdash;the
mo-eeka, pleasant to the taste, but a
virulent poison, a small portion of
which when eaten producing a deathly
sickness, and a full meal, death.
His massive face beamed with satisfaction,
and his dark eye glistened as
he unhooked and dropped it into the
boat, contrary to the custom, which
was to kill and throw it back into the
sea. On landing, he placed his dangerous
prize in a small salt-water
pool near the beach, into which, as
he caught them, he placed others,
until a large mess was collected.
This he brought home one night
when the wind blew from the northwest,
and persuaded the cook to
serve up for the morning meal. Directing
her to throw the offal to the
wood-hogs, he disappeared, and soon
after midnight reached the east
coast, seized a canoe, and put to sea.
The cook, who had her more immediate
grudge to gratify, regaled the
favorite dogs with the heads and entrails;
and this deviation from orders
frustrated the amiable purpose of
her co-conspirator. The howls of
his four-footed companions in the
night, followed by their death in the
morning, told the suspicious Indian
a tale of poison, which a visit to the
kitchen confirmed. A portion of the
breakfast thrown to a stray dog
promptly finished him.</p>

<p>Koche was sought for high and
low, the island ransacked in vain; no
trace of him was found, and the conclusion
was arrived at that he had
thrown himself into the sea. The
chief had taken up a hatchet to kill
his cook, but she sullenly asserted
she had never seen a mo-eeka before,
and was believed and spared,
partly because the fish was rare and
seldom brought to land when taken,
and partly because her good cooking
tickled his palate.</p>

<p>Prior to this attempt to treat him
to the mo-eeka, Mate-oro had swept
the Isle of Rangi-haute of its inhabitants.
The number of captives had
proved much smaller than had been
anticipated, amounting in all to ten
families, and barely repaid the trouble
and risk of the voyage.</p>

<p>When Koche, on the day following
the episode of the poison-fish&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
last, as he flattered himself, of
Mate-oro&mdash;ascended the mountain
of Pitt, and stood upon a throne&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“He was monarch of all he surveyed,<br />
His rights there were none to dispute:</p>
<p class="pp6i">From the centre all round to the sea,<br />
He was lord of the fowl and the brute.”</p>

<p class="p1">His first care was to make a royal
progress over his dominion, in which
he fully expected to reign to the
termination of his life. He felt no
fear of invasion, having traversed
Ware-kauri, and effected his embarkation
unseen. No motive existed
sufficiently strong to induce one, in
the face of the difficulties of a return
trip against the wind, unless it might
be revenge on the part of Mate-oro,
who was dead, and had ceased to
trouble him. Of domestic foes he
had none. The Norway rat, a deserter
from a seal-ship, was the only
quadruped on the island; and the
seal and sea-lion, the only amphibious
animals that had ever frequented
the coast, had long since been
extirpated, and the sealers came there
no more. All looked favorable for
a quiet reign.</p>

<p>Near an old seal camp, he found
growing some wild wheat, which he
cultivated after a manner, and which,
with wild celery, water-cresses, fern-root,
and karaka, left him nothing to
desire in the way of vegetable food.
On the shore, he found crabs and
lobsters, and the echini (sea-eggs)
in the hollows of the rock; and at
times, to supplement his feast, the
sea threw up her orange-colored
pear. The blue petrel had their
habitations in the woods, in the
ground under the roots of trees, and
in crevices of rocks, and were speared
at night as they flew about in
numbers with a noise like the croaking
of frogs. They passed the day
at sea-fishing, and not one was to be
seen until dark put a stop to their
pursuit, when they returned to land,
and fluttered and croaked for hours
before retiring to rest. But the subject
that gave its sovereign least
trouble was the dark-brown water-hen,
of the size of a barnyard fowl,
which inhabited the skirts of the
woods, and fed on the beach. It
was unable to fly, and made no attempt
to escape when approached,
but stood its ground, and bowed,
like a pious Turk, to its fate.</p>

<p>At the base of the mountain, near
a strong spring, he formed a summer-house&mdash;an
arbor of the trees and
shrubs of aromatic myrtle&mdash;and, besides
supplying his wants, did little
else but wander over the isle during
the summer season; but, when winter
came, he retired to a cave in the
mountain, from which he expelled
the bats, and devoted his leisure to
making the utensils of the chase,
toilet, and kitchen. He manufactured
baskets, nets, and lines of twisted
fibre, fish-hooks of mother-of-pearl,
knives of sharp quartz, razors of
shell, and mats for bedding and
cloaks.</p>

<p>He covered his fish alive in red-hot
ashes, and, when cooked, peeled
off the skin, and ate the flesh from
the ribs. He cooked his meat in an
oven, of which he had one at each
residence, and several at points on
the shore. It consisted of a hole in
the ground lined with stone, in which
he built a fire, and placed pebbles
and stones. His game, after the ordinary
cleaning, was scrubbed with
sand on the outside, and well
washed inside and out. Hot pebbles
were placed in the belly and shaken
in under the breast, and green aromatic
leaves stuffed in upon them.
The oven was then cleared of fire
and pebbles, and lined with green
leaves, and the game placed in the
bottom. The fat was washed, and
placed with hot pebbles in a vessel
of bark, and beside it the blood, tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
in a leaf, and propped with hot stones.
Then came a layer of such vegetables
as were in season or at hand, and
the whole was spread over with
leaves, on which the remaining hot
stones were placed, covered in turn
with leaves, and filled in with sod
and earth. After an interval according
to the size of the mess, it was
taken out, spread upon a cloth of
the glossy leaves of the karaka, and
eaten hot.</p>

<p>No king fared better, and no one
that ever reigned passed his days in
equal quietude and peace. No opposing
politicians were there to vex
his soul with diverse counsels, and
make the worse appear to him the
better reason; no blood of fellow-men
weighed down his spirit; no
friends clamored for reward, or silent
enemies shrank from punishment.</p>

<p>He knew neither hunger, thirst, nor
cold, nor fear, nor jealousy, and approached
as near as it lay in fallen
man to the estate of our renowned
ancestor in the garden before the
presentation of Eve. He was content,
wanting no Eve, or Cain, or
Abel. And for ten solitary years
his wish was gratified: he was unapproached,
and reigned unchallenged.</p>

<p>In 1839, the captain of a vessel
from Sidney offered to buy of Mate-oro
a portion of the island of Ware-kauri
that lay about the bay of
Waitangi, then owned and possessed
by a branch of the tribe commanded
by Nga-te-Toma. The terms were
agreed upon, payment to be made
on delivery. But the Nga-te-Toma
could not be prevailed upon to deliver
their possessions of black loam
on demand, the more especially as
Mate-oro was to handle the purchase-money.
War was declared, and the
contumacious Te-Toma were driven
in the following spring into their
stronghold near the beach, and regularly
invested.</p>

<p>At this juncture, the bark <i>Cuba</i>,
having on board one Dieffenbach, a
naturalist, dropped anchor in the
bay, entered into negotiations with
both parties, and, moved by the
spirit of Christian charity, ended by
taking off the Te-Toma at night in
boats to their ship&mdash;first the women
and children, followed by the naked
warriors, stained with ochre, armed,
feathered, and equipped. The last to
leave set fire to the huts and abandoned
property. The flames gave
the alarm to their opponents, who
rushed through the fort to the beach,
where they arrived just too late, and
presented, illuminated by the burning
village in the background, a vivid
picture of baffled rage, going through
the war-dance with fearful yells and
contortions. But they danced in
vain, though the exercise may have
afforded them a melancholy gratification.
The <i>Cuba</i> forthwith put to
sea, and landed her human freight
on the northeastern shore among
friends; but not until she had taken
from them deeds in fee of all their
possessions in the west. Then, judging
wisely that Mate-oro would be
found in no mood at that moment to
discuss their lately acquired title, she
put to sea and bore down on Rangi-haute,
being the first vessel to cross
the channel since Koche passed over
in his canoe ten years before.</p>

<p>Dieffenbach landed with a party,
and in botanizing the isle was led to
the bower by a small spiral column
of white smoke that arose from the
oven. No inhabitant was to be seen.
The summer-house was ransacked of
nets, pearl-hooks, knives, and baskets;
the oven opened, and a spread
of roast duck, hen, and karaka highly
relished. The dark, transparent water
of the spring reflected the faces of
the robbers, as they bent over to drink,
with a distinctness of outline unattainable
by the white water of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
lands; but when Koche returned to
his habitation, which he did when
the ship was well at sea, the reflection
had vanished from his mirror,
the dinner from his oven, and the
furniture from his bower. As from a
rock he watched the receding bark,
freighted with his peace of mind, he
hoped and prayed she would pass
Ware-kauri without touching; but
she ran in nevertheless, communicated
with her friends, and related the
visit to the isle. The news that
Rangi-haute was inhabited soon
reached Mate-oro, who read the riddle
at once, and soon after went
over in person in pursuit of his
quondam slave.</p>

<p>The party landed before noon, and,
separating, closed in upon the bower
from different directions to find it
empty. They soon, however, struck
a fresh trail, which led them down
the coast to a small inlet, in which it
disappeared. Finding it did not
issue on the opposite side, they ascended
either bank, watching closely
for signs, until the bed of the stream
dwindled to a rivulet and entered a
thicket; when the trail was taken up
and followed with difficulty through
bushes and underwood, matted with
vines, until it failed totally. Circuits
were made, and much time wasted
in fruitless search, but the thread was
lost, when the leader suddenly ordered
the party back on the trail to the
mouth of the inlet, which they crossed,
and moved down the beach looking
for footprints in the sand. Late
in the afternoon they arrived opposite
a coral rock that stood out a mile in
the sea. The water was smooth,
and a man swam out to reconnoitre.
They watched him until he disappeared
behind the rock, which
presented a bluff to the shore, and
waited patiently to hear from him,
but an hour had elapsed and he
made no sign. The general opinion
was that he had been devoured by a
shark. Mate-oro thought otherwise.
He sent back a couple of men with
orders to bring down the boat at daybreak,
set a watch on the beach,
built a fire, and went into camp.</p>

<p>A favorable breeze springing up,
the boat came in early, took aboard
the party, and rowed out. In a deep
fissure in the rock, from which he
was unable to extricate himself, they
found the Indian who had swum out
the evening before. He told them
that when he turned, and was about
to land, he was seized by the foot
and drawn under the water, and,
being tired and out of breath, almost
instantly lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When he recovered he found himself
in utter darkness, and thought
he had passed into the spirit-land
and was imbedded in a mountain for
punishment. After a time he had
looked up and seen the stars, but
could make nothing of his condition.
He had seen or heard no one, but as
well as he could recollect, the grasp
on his ankle felt like the hand of a
man. Several pieces of fresh broken
coral were found, but no footprints.</p>

<p>The party hastened ashore, and,
leaving a man with the boat, moved
down the beach, and an hour later
struck the trail coming out of the
water, and pursued it up a frightful
chasm in the mountain, apparently
without an outlet. But as they neared
the head they discovered the point
at which the trail began the ascent,
and abandoning their dogs, the men,
after much difficulty and danger,
gained the summit; when, to their
inexpressible astonishment, the trail
led them directly back to their camp
on the beach&mdash;on reaching which
they found their boatman lying on
the sand bound hand and foot with
a running vine, gagged, and stunned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
by a blow on the head, and the boat
gone.</p>

<p>The rage of Mate-oro was excessive,
and expended itself upon the
ill-starred boatman, whom he ordered
to be tossed into the surf&mdash;a step
he speedily regretted and attempted
to rectify; but when dragged out to
be cross-questioned, the body could
return no answer; its shade had
quitted it, and was paddling a phantom
canoe over the Stygian river to
the shadowy fishing-grounds.</p>

<p>The pursuers, full of wrath, set to
work and built a korari, in which,
when the wind became favorable,
they made their way home, calling
down maledictions upon the head of
the rebellious runaway. During their
stay they scoured the island for
Koche, and kept a lookout for their
lost boat, but saw nothing of either.</p>

<p>To the eastward of the southern
point of Rangi-haute, and five miles
distant, lies the islet of Ranga-tira,
consisting of a single mount of moderate
elevation, from two to three
miles across at the base, behind
which Koche took shelter in his captured
boat. The same favoring
breeze that brought down his enemies
in the morning, enabled him in
a short run to double the “tira,” and
land upon her little beach of forty
yards, quite out of sight and reach.</p>

<p>Had the fugitive been content to
take up his permanent habitation
here, all might doubtless have gone
well; but the islet was too small to
offer a place of concealment, and he
feared an unsuccessful search on the
larger island would be followed by
one on the smaller, in which event
escape would be impossible. For
this and other reasons, in which the
question of food entered, but a cat-like
attachment to his old haunts
ruled, he returned in the night after
an absence of a month, and, reconnoitring,
found the coast clear. He
had resumed his old habits, adding
to them a bright lookout to the
northwest, when one morning at
daybreak, some months later, he
discovered three canoes close in to
shore. He instantly struck into a
deep ravine, and hoped by doubling
to gain time to reach and launch his
boat. But he had hardly got fairly
off before his trail was taken up, and
after a hot chase, in ascending a
dark defile, the dogs brought him to
bay, and, turning, he took up a rock
and dashed out the brains of the
foremost, and was in deadly conflict
with the pack, bleeding and faint,
when a Zealander came up with a
club and felled him to the ground.
When he recovered his senses they
were dragging him down the mountain
by a rope tied about the waist,
torn with stones and briers, and
bathed in blood; but even then, until
they reached the white beach,
soon stained red, he caught at every
root, and projecting stone, and bush,
and log, and held on with such
tenacity that they were compelled
to beat his hands to force them to
relax. He lay on the sand bound
hand and foot all night, with parched
mouth and throat, so bitten by
the black sand-fly that by noon on
the following day he was swollen out
of the semblance of man.</p>

<p>When taken back to Ware-kauri
he was confined and watched closely,
taunted with the title of “King of
Pitt Island,” fed and watered, but not
bodily ill-used. When sufficiently
recovered and ordered to work, he
stood mute under two days’ lashing,
seeking death; but his master, who
felt his honor enlisted in the contest,
had resolved to break, not kill him;
and no provocation could wring from
him the death-stroke. Perceiving
this on the third morning, Koche set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
to work when ordered, and from
thence performed the labor of two
men; apparently completely subjugated.
From the fight with the dogs
in the defile he had not uttered a
word; now he became cheerful and
talkative.</p>

<p>In the fourth year of his renewed
captivity, all watch upon him having
been removed, he was one evening
among the slaves, employed in paddling
out canoe-loads of provisions
to a whale-ship that was lifting her
anchor to sail. He boarded, and
hid away in the hold unnoticed; and
the ship was clearing the harbor,
when Mate-oro came out and instituted
search. He was found and
dragged on deck, but broke from his
captors and sprang overboard. The
ship’s boat gave chase, overhauled
him, and, as Mate-oro rose up in the
bow to lay hands on him, he dived,
and, coming up behind, unshipped
their rudder, and in the gathering
dark reached the headland and disappeared.
He made his way by forest
paths to the eastern coast, where,
finding an abandoned and broken
canoe, he stuffed her with kelp, and
put to sea; by daylight he had sunk
her below the eastern horizon, and at
nightfall ran her on the beach of
Rangi-haute.</p>

<p>Koche was himself again. He
breathed anew the air of freedom,
and his soul exulted. Taught in his
little school of adversity, he knew
that vigilance would be the price of
his liberty, and determined to exercise
it, and carried out his resolution
as well, perhaps, as any man since
the sun first shed on Eden his delightful
beams&mdash;that sun which shone
upon him in his frail canoe that day
for the last time for two dark years;
and on which, of his own free will, he
never would have looked again.</p>

<p>After picking up what food he
could find upon the beach, and
breaking up and burying his canoe in
a sand dune, he crossed the mountain,
and, plunging into an obscure
thicket, almost impenetrable, crawled
into a crevice surrounded by jagged
fragments of volcanic rock. The
spot was almost absolutely inaccessible,
and the danger of approach
would have appalled a spirit less
dauntless than his&mdash;not bent on liberty
or death. He had breasted his
way to it in the glare of day when
perambulating his dominion; he now
entered it with speed and safety a
fugitive at midnight.</p>

<p>In his retreat, he made and used no
instrument whatever&mdash;no spear, or
snare, or knife, or line, or net. He
never once approached the shore, or
left the circle of his crags and dense
surrounding thicket. At dusk he
peered from his sepulchre, and watched
the birds take up their roosts upon
the overtopping trees and bushes, and
climbed up and caught them in the
night, and ate them raw. Hunger at
first assailed him; but his eye, becoming
adjusted to the dark, marked
down his prey with unerring certainty,
and he was soon able to drive and
keep the wolf from his den; and a
water-drip in the rock quenched his
thirst. At dawn he sank into the
earth, leaving behind no trace, no
print of foot, no trail; and when the
sun uprose,</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“The mists were curl’d<br />
Back from a solitary world.”</p>

<p class="p1">The annals of his dark reign are
soon told. Sleeping one day down
in the impenetrable darkness, he was
startled by the deep bay of a bloodhound;
and his prophetic soul told
him that the day of his second dethronement
had dawned, and his night
of freedom passed. Mate-oro had
searched the isle in vain, and given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
up the hunt, when Gobiah, a New
Zealand son of Belial, brought over
a slave-hunter whose deep hate penetrated
the impenetrable, and ran the
fugitive to earth.</p>

<p>Expectation in Ware-kauri was on
tiptoe during the absence of the
hunting-party; and on its return with
the captive king a curious crowd assembled
on the beach to greet them.
As the boat came through the surf
with Mate-oro on the prow and
Koche bound at his feet, a shout went
up in honor of the chief, followed by
derisive howling for the “King of
Pitt.” The march across the island
was triumphal. Crowds flocked to
gaze upon the principal figures. The
New Zealanders praised their persevering
chief, and called upon the
“king” to burst his bonds. The
Tuïti, apart, with sullen and downcast
looks, felt their faint hearts beat
quick as they caught a glance of
their indomitable countryman, stimulated
by the sunlight, erect and
proud, by whom the taunts of the
malignant masters were passing as
the idle wind.</p>

<p>Gobiah and the hound shared the
honors of the day, and all went merry
as a marriage-bell.</p>

<p>The capture, with its varying and
contradictory details, was the sensation
of the period, and would have filled
the columns of a newspaper, had one
existed, for a month. It subsided in
due course, and Koche, after another
futile attempt to get himself despatched,
went to work as before with
vigor and good cheer. His sovereign
character was now universally recognized,
and he was invariably addressed
by his title in full. He accepted
it in good humor, tinged with
a little pride. The Zealanders looked
upon him with secret respect,
while by his own people he was
regarded as one who, had their lot
been less hopeless, would have proved
the leader and saviour of the
nation.</p>

<p>Two years elapsed, when an American
vessel, ready for sea, was boarded
by Mate-oro, and a demand made
for the fugitive king. The ship was
searched from deck to keel, but no
trace of him found. Unwilling to
anger the fierce chief, who still declared
he was aboard, she lay over a
day, and the search was renewed
with like effect. In the afternoon
she stood out to sea, and at nightfall
her hull was down, and the
island had disappeared, all save one
volcanic peak that rose like a pyramid
above the waves. Then Koche
came out from the fore-chains, in
which he had in some mysterious
manner buried himself, and caught a
last glance of his native mountain as
it sank for ever from his view.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c558" id="c558">NECESSITY <i>VERSUS</i> ART.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">We</span> live in very busy days, and our
lives hurry on to their end after a
very unceremonious fashion. Courtesy
is out of date, and the world
scrambles on chiefly according to the
principle embodied in the words,
“Every one for himself, and God for
all.” This is the age of individualism
on the one hand, of levelling on the
other. The system of aggregate
life, of Christian brotherhood, and
helpful fellowship is broken, and each
one lives his little span to himself,
jealously cherishing a phantom of
independence which, when appealed
to for protection, has a tendency to
shelter itself under the broader ægis
of state supremacy. We live fast,
and our lives wear us out. We pass
through all the emotions, all the experiences,
of life in fewer years than
our forefathers took to study their
classics or prepare themselves for a
profession. Young men who have
reached the <i>nil admirari</i> stage before
they are twenty, and young women
who, before they are out of their
teens, have gone through the various
religious phases, and made up
their minds that infidelity is the only
rational system to adopt, are unfortunately
on the increase among us.
After pleasure, after controversy,
what remains? Nothing but business.
The mind of our day is essentially
practical. A certain social necessity
exists of living as well as your
neighbors do, and of not “going down
in the world.” Certain artificial
habits are formed almost unconsciously
in early youth; certain fictitious
indispensabilities grow up silently by
your side, and, to keep up appearances,
a certain amount of money is
wanted. In a new country where
there is no privileged class, no landed
aristocracy, no law of primogeniture, each
individual, to keep his
head above water, imagines he must
take some means to increase his
income as years go on. This means
that the whole community should
devote itself to commerce. But how
does this “necessity” affect the abstract
principles of right and wrong,
of moral beauty, of intellectual development?
In this race for life,
where is all that makes life beautiful?
This utilitarian spirit looks
upon all that from its own point of
view, as an auctioneer, not as an
artist. The question is, “Will it pay?”
or “How much will it bring?” not
“Is it civilizing, is it beautifying, is
it ennobling?”</p>

<p>Beauty is nothing to modern critics;
it is no longer judged by an
abstract standard, but by the use
which can be made of it. It is utterly
debased from its original estate;
for, from being the consolation of the
many, it has become the luxury of
the few. Rich men think it right
and proper that they should be surrounded
by ornamental objects, not
because they appreciate their worth,
but because it shows off the wealth
whose surplus they could afford to
waste on such expensive baubles.
Costliness in ornamentation is the
fashion of our day, as simplicity and
studied ruggedness were the fashion
in the days of Cromwell; and, cost
what it may, the fashion must be
followed. Do these men care for
their treasures? See what they
would do with them if it ever became
the fashion again to sit on wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
chairs, and eschew looking-glasses.
They are valued, as in a shop, by
the price they cost; and old or new,
elaborate or plain, it is all the same.
The number of figures on a Dresden
vase is nothing: the number of dollars
the vase cost is everything.
Some people would think nothing of
a gem of workmanship if it was got
“at a bargain” or picked up on an
old stall; some would not be satisfied
if the velvet they wore had been
purchased at half price, so that they
could not boast it had cost twenty-five
dollars a yard! We will hope
that such people are exceptions;
still, they exist. This is the exaggeration
of the spirit of the age, and
prevails chiefly among those whom
the latter half of the age has just
landed among the inhabitants of the
modern El Dorado; but, in a more or
less rampant state, this spirit shows
its cloven foot everywhere on this
vast continent.</p>

<p>But this is not the worst. If the
appreciation of true art is wanting in
the patron, the time to perfect æsthetic
productions is wanting to the
artist. Nowadays everything must be
done at once; people cannot wait;
their houses must be run up in six
weeks; for their churches they will
not wait longer than a year. Ornaments
of all kinds must be forthcoming
immediately, and, indeed, if any
vegetable model could be found,
which, like the acanthus leaf of Greek
sculpture, might be identified with the
idea of our modern “art,” who shall
say that the mushroom is not a most
fitting type? Must we suppose it to
be the result of our wonderfully rapid
progress in art that we should constantly
change our ideals, and demand
quite a different standard of
beauty this month from that we asked
for last June? No doubt we are so
much more enlightened now that we
could not wear the same colors we
wore last spring, and really thought
quite pretty then, or that we could
not sit upon a sofa of the same shape
as we found perfectly charming last
year! Of course, since our standards
of taste vary so quickly, it could
hardly be expected that very minute
care should be bestowed on our
ornamental surroundings. In old
days, when men worked for future
ages, the leg of a chair was as delicately
carved as a cathedral buttress;
when houses were built for twenty
coming generations to live in, the
sculpture of a mantelpiece was
wrought with as much care as a
monumental effigy. But <i>nous avons
changé tout cela</i>. Our houses are
only intended to stand till they are
pulled down to make room for a
railway depot, or till some advantageous
offer is accepted to turn them into
a suite of <i>modiste’s</i> or confectioner’s
show-rooms. Our furniture is meant
to remain under our eyes only until
we see a set five times as gorgeous
and ten times as expensive, when the
things we once thought so perfect
will be sent as antiquated rubbish to
some auction-room, or ignominously
hidden in the nursery or garret. And
in the meanwhile, where is art, nay,
where is even comfort? Shall we
not very soon have overshot the
mark, and find our lives becoming
little short of a pilgrimage from hotel
to hotel? An English lady, whose
husband owned estates in all parts
of England, Scotland, and Wales,
and who had at least six country-houses,
each claiming the advantages
of family residence during a short part
of the year, once said to a friend less
plentifully encumbered: “My dear, I
envy you. I have half a dozen houses
in the country, and a large town-house;
and, among them all, I have
not got a <i>home</i>!”</p>

<p>This constant change of fashion necessitates
flimsiness of material and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
carelessness of detail. But this is not
all: it kills the artist spirit. The old
workmen had a chance of becoming
artists because they had plenty of time
to exercise and sharpen their faculties;
they became used to certain sorts of
work, and could perfect their ingenuity
in one particular line; and they
had plenty of room for originality.
Now, on the contrary, it is more likely
that the artist will degenerate into a
mere workman. He is hurried in his
designs; he is often dictated to by
ignorant patrons, who, not having the
divine <i>afflatus</i> themselves, have not
even the wit to trust to those who
have; he is called upon for six times
the amount of invention that any
man’s brains can possibly furnish
within a given time; and, to crown all,
he is limited as to price&mdash;which simply
means as to materials, size, detail,
and ornamentation. He is in danger
of becoming either a drudge or a
renegade, very often both. His art
gets to be a mere bread-winning business,
a dry round of machine work,
a careless fulfilling of an unpleasant
contract; and, under such adverse influences,
no wonder the creator-spirit
leaves him, and he becomes simply a
mechanic.</p>

<p>Art was once a power in the
world: now it is rather an appendage
to a power of a different sort.
Even while it was patronized by
popes and sovereigns, it was held as
little less than sovereign itself; it
dictated terms, and claimed a full
meed of independence in the choice
of its expressions within the limitations
of orthodox symbolism. Now,
on the contrary, it is only tolerated
so long as it conforms to the fashion
of the hour, so long as it ministers to
the belittled taste of to-day. Its votaries
are no longer the honored
guests of princes, the equals of sovereigns,
the arbiters of character. Of
old, a painter could immortalize a man
by placing him in a certain part of
his picture, or he could ruin him by
giving him a place on the opposite
side. Dante did the same thing in
his unrivalled poem, and the sting
went home. But now what would
the result be? The painter would
lose his custom, like a tradesman
who sold damaged goods! Truly a
dignified position for the successors
of Michael Angelo!</p>

<p>To be popular&mdash;and popularity
just now is apt to be confounded with
greatness&mdash;art must truckle to the
vitiated taste of a mob of ignoramuses;
architecture must give up
noble proportions for the sake of
speed and cheapness; painting must
give up historical memories and religious
inspirations for the sake of
quick sales and gaudy coloring;
music and poetry must adapt themselves
to the maudlin taste of the
age, and pretty, shallow ballads and
idyls must take the place of symphonies,
anthems, and epic poems. So
with oratory&mdash;it must be graceful and
piquant; that it should be logical
and forcible is immaterial. So with
sculpture&mdash;we must have Rogers’
groups, sewing-girls (why not have
a sewing-machine and operator in
marble?), shoe-blacks, anything that
is domestic and prosaic, provided we
have nothing heroic that will strain
our powers of admiration, or excite
high aspirations after the ideal.</p>

<p>As to minor articles which of old
were real objects of art, how do we
stand? Our jewelry, for instance&mdash;in
what stage of decay is it? Would
Benvenuto Cellini think our clumsy
plate worthy of his attention, or our
massive barbaric bracelets <i>artistic</i>
productions? On the other hand,
the lighter work is flimsy and insecure,
equally unworthy of a chiseller’s
notice, except he toss it into the
furnace, and reduce the materials
into an usable shape. Again the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
money test comes in: the mere
value of a precious stone is all, in
modern times; the delicacy of the
setting, the thought of the designer,
the time of the worker, are perfectly
immaterial.</p>

<p>Then our glass: it has no individuality
whatsoever. We remember
noticing the strange contrast which
happened to be most vividly exhibited
in a certain street in London,
where two shops side by side
showed a glittering array of their respective
specialty, English and Venetian
glass. The former, all blown
by machinery, showed the most perfect
symmetry of design, each glass
of a set the exact counterpart of the
other, the designs not varied to the
extent of more than half a dozen
patterns, and the very prettiest
things&mdash;baskets, for instance, or horns
of glass&mdash;pairfully, like three or four
dozen similar ones, allotted to their
particular corner in the shop. The
Venetian glass, on the contrary, was
a study for a painter. Every conceivable
variety of color, shape, and
design, a luxuriance of detail, a fertility
of invention perfectly incredible,
a picturesque individuality which
will not allow even pairs to do more
than bear a general likeness to each
other&mdash;such are a few of the characteristics
of this beautiful display of
ornaments. We took up a fruit-dish
of opaque glass, and asked if there
were any more of that sort, none but
that one being visible in the shop.
It was a marvellous conglomeration
of colors, veined like marble, vivid
shades dying off into browns and
dusky yellows, etc. No; there were
no more of them. “How was this
produced?” we asked. “I cannot
tell,” said the polite Venetian who
kept watch over these treasures;
“this is a mere chance; the glass
sometimes runs into these designs,
but we might try for years, and never
be able to reproduce this.” The
other articles, some useful, some ornamental,
and all moulded by the
hand, attested the most delicate and
fantastic skill; the fancy of the
workman had been allowed to run
riot within certain general limits; no
line was the exact counterpart of the
other&mdash;in a word, the work was artistic,
not mechanical. The contrast
was evidently unfavorable to the
faultlessly mathematical proportions
of the English glass, which, however,
in its own line, and freed from comparison
with higher products, is very
beautiful.</p>

<p>Machinery has spoilt many minor
arts; even the choir-stalls
and the screens of our day are
often “turned” instead of carved,
and in the place of wrought-iron we
have cast-iron in our grates and railings.
Even the domain of music
has been invaded, and we have barrel-organs,
orchestrions, and musical
boxes. Some new mechanism in a
Geneva box will command thousands
of dollars, and for a musical canary
with jewelled eyes, caged in a tiny
gilded cage, people will give any
sum; but who thinks twice of some
unknown Beethoven or struggling
Mendelssohn whose sonatas and anthems
might rival those of the masters
of old?</p>

<p>All that we have said is merely an
introduction to an explanation of the
main subject of which we wish to
treat, <i>i.e.</i> the effect of this modern
spirit on artists themselves. There
are personal ramifications consequent
on this low estimate of art which
amount just to this: intellectual murder.
The artist starts in life full of
young enthusiasm&mdash;and we include
here all scholars and men who, in
different professions, reverence the
principle more than they care for the
use of their craft&mdash;he feels that there is
an intellectual world beyond and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
above the world of business and
fashion, and he strives to spread the
love of this ideal among commoner
mortals. He finds them unresponsive,
though he feels himself a teacher
sent to enlighten them. Still they
remain callous; they look on and
laugh, and he starves. His art is all
he has whereby to live; for the spirit
that recruits the ranks of art is a vagrant
and fitful one, and does not
qualify men for steady habits of lucrative
drudgery. The truth now
stares him in the face: he must either
pocket his principles or lie down and
die of hunger. If he is unusually
persevering, and has that genius
which does not alight more than
three or four times in a century on
any child of Adam, he may end by
winning a place at last in public
opinion, by commanding what prices
he likes, and by drowning, in the precarious
tide of success, the remembrance
of the days when he fell below
his own standard, and had to
drudge for bread. More often he
will never succeed at all; he will give
up the unequal struggle, and be too
glad if, by bartering his independence,
he can feed his wife and children.</p>

<p>We need hardly stop to say
how baleful marriage too often is in
the case of artists; every one must
see that. Unless in the rare instances
when a man meets a woman heroic
enough to help him on in the
difficult paths of genius, nothing is
more fatally clogging than marriage.
It is idle to speak of the joys and
comforts which it brings. These are
ephemeral in ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred where an artist of even
average talent is concerned, while
the responsibilities and vexations of
marriage grow heavier every day.
An artist’s joy in his wife can only be
of two kinds: it results either from
her physical beauty or from her intellectual
sympathy. The former
any sane man will weary of, even
if he be rich enough to surround it
with all those adjuncts without which
the beauty itself will soon disappear;
the latter implies that ideal union
which we have reason to deplore as
being too rare to be even taken into
practical consideration. We are
speaking emphatically of poor artists,
and every one knows the peculiarly
trying circumstances of poverty in
any shape, more especially poverty
endured by a refined nature. The
domestic vexations of a poor artist’s
married life are something incalculable,
and are almost enough to destroy
the patience of a saint. He may be
poet, painter, or musician, it little
matters what; but it is simply impossible
that the daily, hourly shocks to
his sensibilities should not leave a
woeful impression on his spirit. Is it
encouraging to be interrupted in the
middle of a fine stanza by shrieks
from the kitchen, and frantic appeals
to come and rescue the urchin who
has pulled the wash-tub over himself?
Is it inspiring to be interrupted in a
fugue by the sound of a servant’s
shrill answer to the scolding of her
incensed mistress? The contemplation
of an empty larder, and the calculation
of how to fill it again at the
lowest figure of expense, is not an
elevated occupation, nor is it likely
to produce a very spirited picture or
soul-stirring poem. Except in very
rare cases, a rising artist should put
off marriage till his fame is in all
men’s mouths. A drag is a different
thing from a companion, and to most
such even a few years’ solitude ending
in a mature choice ought to be
far preferable to an uncongenial yoke
which, long before success has softened
it, has become only a necessary
evil.</p>

<p>But even to the unmarried artist
or scholar, life holds out terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
temptations. Many mistake popularity
for greatness, sensationalism for
genius. If the higher walks of art
do not “pay,” let us forsake them,
and pick up gold in the byways!
The trace of the clay will not stick
to the precious metal, and, if it has
come from the pocket of ignorance
to pay the price of vulgarity, still it
is “hard cash,” and will be none the
less welcome at the exchange! It
will buy houses and land, it will buy
broadcloth and velvet, it will buy
champagne suppers and opera tickets.
The artist sees that he must be
a slave&mdash;a slave either to his own
necessities or to the bad taste of his
patrons. The former means silent
worship at the shrine of true art, an
early death, an unknown grave, and
an obscure name; the latter means
unblushing indifference to principle,
a long and merry life, and a name on
the lips of thousands. Human nature
is weak, and, out of twenty men who
once had the possibilities of genius,
nineteen will crush its development
to earn their daily bread. No wonder
that we have so few artists nowadays;
no wonder that men who
might have been so are only caterers
for public amusement and “turners-out”
of so many landscapes or interiors
a year. What are the subjects
most in vogue just now, not to speak
of nudities and immoralities? Everything
that is trivial, pretty, if you
will, but commonplace&mdash;children picking
flowers, drawing-room scenes,
a farm kitchen, a group of cattle, a
nosegay lying beside a flagon of
wine, a few vegetables sliced open,
a woman mending a shirt, etc.!
Truly most noble subjects whereon
to expend the time, care, and ingenuity
of a man of genius&mdash;a man, at
least, who might once have aspired
to genius! But these things sell&mdash;everything
trivial, childish, and <i>mesquin</i>
does in our day&mdash;and the artist
must live! When necessity and art
come into collision, art must go to
the wall! In music, ballads are the
order of the day&mdash;pretty little nothings
set to pretty little tunes; strains
that are often no better than a cross
between a popular song and a revival
hymn! In poetry, the case is
no better; in the drama, it is worse.
The very patronage which lifts a
man into notice kills his genius and
insults his manhood. A drawing-room
pet is the highest title an artist
can claim in these days, and, to gain
that pitiful renown, he must throw
overboard all respect for principle,
all love of art. He must even make
himself uncomfortable, forego innocent
habits, burden himself with stupid
formalities, in order to reach
that favor which he feels in his inmost
soul will only degrade him
when he has won it. Many a man
sells his soul to the devil in these
days, just as in former times, but
with this difference: that, in the old
legends, the devil always gave a generous
equivalent, whereas now he
puts one off with very shabby gifts.</p>

<p>There is a quaint old tale of this
sort current at Bruges, concerning
an unhappy organist of very mediocre
talents but immense ambition.
He was dying with envy because the
organist of the cathedral drew
crowds to hear his marvellous playing,
while he himself could barely
draw out a few meagre harmonies.
At last, in despair, he made a compact
with the devil, bartering his
soul for a long lease of years, during
which he should be enabled to
eclipse the best musicians in Europe.
Suddenly it began to be noised about
that there had been some strange
charm at work; the obscure artist
had blossomed into a prodigy, and
the cathedral was deserted. Years
went on, and all the musical talent
of the mediæval world made pilgrimages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
to Bruges to hear the wonderful
musician whose fingers could evoke
such matchless harmonies, and cause
the most hardened sinners to melt
into tears. But one day, the poor
man got frightened, and, with much
contrition and many prayers, besought
a priest to get him back his
contract. The priest succeeded, and
the devil was compelled to release
his victim. The organist went as
usual to his instrument. The church
was full; foreigners were there and
many of the notabilities of the town;
but the musician’s power had fled.
The result was a disgraceful failure,
and the strangers left the church, declaring
that a trick had been put
upon them. The unhappy man,
distracted and overwhelmed with
shame, could not bear the ridicule of
his altered position, and, in a moment
of desperation, called again upon his
former ally. The devil forbore to reproach
him, and gladly gave him
back the fatal talent. Things went
on as before; it was said that a sudden
indisposition had been the only
cause of that memorable break-down,
and crowds again flocked to hear the
inspired organist. His end is darkly
hinted to have been terrible.</p>

<p>Well in this case&mdash;supposing it to
have been true&mdash;the power over the
organ was a tangible and valuable
gift; but nowadays artists and their
patrons rather remind us of the story
of Esau selling his birthright for a
<i>mess of pottage</i>! Rich men should
feel themselves honored by contact
with artists, not <i>vice versa</i>. It is no
more an honor for an artist to please
a millionaire than it is for the church
to receive again a truant and gifted
son. The abstract laws of art and intellect
are above the superficial and
shifting necessities of the world, and,
if there is to be any intercourse between
the votaries of the former and
the slaves of the latter, it should be the
part of the lower natures to do homage
first to the higher. A great king
once said to his courtiers, when one
of them importuned him to bestow a
title upon him: “Assuredly I can
make you a duke, monsieur, but
God alone can make you a gentleman.”
God alone can make an
artist; God alone can mould a spirit
as refined, a soul as complex, an organization
as sensitive, as art requires
in its devotees; and it follows that
whosoever wilfully debases this spirit
destroys God’s own handiwork. The
world at large and its absurd maxims
are much to blame, but the imprudence
or carelessness of artists is
none the less deplorable. No one
should without reason arrogate to
himself this position; it is a species
of priesthood, and, except a man or
woman be impelled to an æsthetic
career by an irresistible impulse, it
is not a safe or happy path to tread.
None can live in that atmosphere
unless God has really fitted them
for it, and to them, if they carry their
lamps unquenched to the end, it
must needs be a path of trial. As a
pure speculation, it is the worst career
a practical man can embrace.
It dooms the artist to a solitary life&mdash;solitary
in fact if he wishes to succeed;
solitary in spirit if he hastily
burdens himself with a badly chosen
companion.</p>

<p>We were going to say that
the ideal state of art would be
that all artists should be born rich;
but, though that would have its advantages,
it would perhaps take away
from the dignity of art. Meyerbeer
was born of a wealthy family, and
Titian lived like a prince, but those
are exceptions. Besides, Titian won
his riches by his art, though his is
a bad example to refer to, by the way,
since he truckled very much to the
prevalent taste of his gorgeous era.
All artists who have touched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
noblest chords of human nature
have lived and died poor, and all
artists in the future who care to emulate
these giants of the past will
have to resign themselves to a like
poverty. Money, in these days&mdash;and
perhaps, if we had lived in other
days, we should have found it much
the same then&mdash;means a compromise
with principle. Those who are born
with it can alone enjoy it unmolested,
and, say what you will, they will
always know how to enjoy it best.
No one is so discriminating a patron
of art and so considerate a friend of
artists as the hereditary land-owner
whose ancestors for generations were
born to wealth and its duties; no
one loves beauty so disinterestedly
as one to whom the beautiful has
never in any shape been a source of
profit.</p>

<p>An aristocracy of birth and education
is better fitted than one of
wealth to appreciate the aristocracy
of intellect; both are, in the purest
sense of the word, a “privileged
class,” and both ought to be actuated
by the proud old motto: <i>Noblesse
oblige</i>. Money can never be the
test of the unseen; genius cannot be
purchased, and art has no price.
The heaviest equivalent ever paid for
any work of art is but a drop in the
ocean compared to the thing gained;
for it is not the material you pay
for&mdash;the canvas, the marble, or the
painting; it is not even the artist’s
time, though that is most precious;
but it is the very soul of the man,
the breath of his life, the essence of
his being. What can ever be sufficient
compensation for that? You
can buy the expression of his
thought, but his thought itself remains
with him, so that his work is
more his own than it is yours even
after you have purchased it. His
creations are his children, and belong
to him by that inalienable right of
paternity which no human law of sale
and barter could possibly supersede.</p>

<p>After this, what are we to think of
art? Simply that it is the most divine
gift, in the natural order, vouchsafed
to man, and entitles the artist
to a place more exalted than that
of any favorite of fortune, be he
prince, noble, or merchant. When
will the common world of rich men
understand that? When will artists
themselves ensure that it be not forgotten?
That it is not merely a
means of living, a bread-winning
drudgery? It is a reflection of
God, a ray of his creative power,
a solace given to earth, a humanizing
influence left among the barbarians
of all times (for we are all
barbarians in the long run, and saints
and artists are the only civilized beings
worth notice!) Let us, then, bow
down our heads, and accept the dictation
of art, rather than presume
to impose our trivial conventionalities
on one of God’s chosen messengers.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">FROM THE FRENCH OF ERCKMANN-CHATRIAN.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> I was a boy, I used to go
every day after school to watch
Jean-Pierre Coustel, the turner, at his
work. He lived at the other end of
the village. He was an old man,
partly bald, with a queue hanging
down his back, and his feet encased
in old worn-out shoes. He used to
love to talk of his campaigns on the
Rhine and on the Loire in La
Vendée. Then he would look at
you and smile to himself. His little
wife, Mme. Jeannette, sat spinning in
the corner behind him; she had
large black eyes, and her hair was so
white that it looked like flax. I can
see her now. She would sit there listening,
and she would stop spinning
whenever Jean-Pierre spoke of
Nantes; it was there they were married
in ‘93. Yes; I can see all these
things as if it were yesterday: the
two small windows overgrown with
ivy; the three bee-hives on a board
above the old worm-eaten door, the
bees fluttering in the sunshine over
the roof of the hovel; Jean-Pierre
Coustel with his bent back turning
bobbins or rods for chairs; the shavings
winding themselves into the
shape of corkscrews.... I can see
it all!</p>

<p>And I can also see coming in the
evenings Jacques Chatillon, the
dealer in wood, with his rule under
his arm, and his thick red whiskers;
the forest-keeper, Benassis, with his
game-bag on his hip and his hunting-cap
over his ears; M. Nadasi,
the bailiff, walking proudly, with his
head up, and spectacles on his nose,
his hands in his coat-pockets, as if to
say: “I am Nadasi, and I carry the
citations to the insolvent”; and then
my Uncle Eustache, who was called
“brigadier,” because he had served
at Chamboran, and many others besides;
without counting the wife of
the little tailor Rigodin, who used to
come after nine o’clock in search of
her husband, in order to be invited
to drink half a pint of wine&mdash;for, besides
his trade of a turner, Jean-Pierre
Coustel kept a wayside tavern.
The branch of fir hung over the low
door; and in winter, when it rained,
or when the snow covered the window-panes,
many liked to sit under
the shelter of the old hut, and listen
to the crackling of the fire, and the
humming sound of Jeannette’s spinning-wheel,
and the wind whistling
out of doors through the street of the
village.</p>

<p>For my part, I did not stir from
my corner until Uncle Eustache,
shaking out the ashes of his pipe,
would say to me: “Come, François,
we must be going.... Good-night
all!...”</p>

<p>Then he would rise, and we would
go out together, sometimes in the
mud, sometimes in the snow. We
would go to sleep at my grandfather’s
house, and he used to sit up
and wait for us.</p>

<p>How plainly I can see these far-off
things when I think them over!</p>

<p>But what I remember best is the
story of the salt marshes which belonged
to old Jeannette&mdash;the salt
marshes she had owned in La Vendée
near the sea, and which would
have made the fortune of the Coustels
if they had claimed their rights
sooner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that, in ‘93, they
drowned a great many people at
Nantes, chiefly the old aristocracy.
They put them into barks tied together;
then they pushed the barks
into the Loire, and sank them. It
was during the Reign of Terror, and
the peasants of La Vendée also shot
down all the republican soldiers they
could take; extermination was the
rule on both sides, and no mercy was
shown by either party. Only, whenever
a republican soldier demanded
in marriage one of these noble ladies
who were about to be drowned, if
the unfortunate girl were willing to
follow him, she was immediately released.
And this was how Mme.
Jeannette had become the wife of
Coustel.</p>

<p>She was on one of these barks at the
age of sixteen&mdash;an age when one has
a great dread of death!... She
looked around to see if no one would
take pity on her, and just then, at
the moment the bark was leaving,
Jean-Pierre Coustel was passing by
with his musket on his shoulders; he
saw the young girl, and called out:
“Halt ... a moment!... Citoyenne,
wilt thou marry me? I will
save thy life!”</p>

<p>And Jeannette fell into his arms as
if dead; he carried her away; they
went to the mayoralty.</p>

<p>Old Jeannette never spoke of
these things. In her youth, she had
been very happy; she had had domestics,
waiting-maids, horses, carriages;
then she had become the
wife of a soldier, of a poor republican;
she had to cook for him, and
to mend his clothes; the old ideas
of the château, of the respect of the
peasants of La Vendée, had passed
away. So goes the world! And
sometimes even the bailiff Nadasi in
his impertinence would mock at the
poor old woman, and call out to her:
“Noble lady, a pint of wine!...
a small glass.” He would also make
inquiries about her estates; then she
would shut her lips tight, and look
at him; a faint color would come into
her pale cheek, and it appeared
as if she were going to answer him;
but afterwards she would bend down
her head, and go on spinning in
silence.</p>

<p>If Nadasi had not spent money at
the tavern, Coustel would have turned
him out of doors; but, when one
is poor, one is obliged to put up
with many affronts, and rascals know
this!... They never mock at those
who would be likely to pull their
ears, as my Uncle Eustache would
not have failed to do: they are too
prudent for that. How hard it is
to put up with creatures like these!...
Every one knows there are
such beings. But I must go on with
my story. We were at the tavern
one evening at the end of the autumn
of 1830; it was raining in torrents,
and about eight o’clock in the
evening the keeper Benassis entered,
exclaiming: “What weather!... If
it continues, the three ponds will
overflow.”</p>

<p>He shook out his cap, and took
his blouse off his shoulders, to dry it
behind the stove. Then he came to
seat himself on the end of the bench,
saying to Nadasi: “Come, make
room, you lazy fellow, and let me sit
near the brigadier.”</p>

<p>Nadasi moved back.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the rain, Benassis
appeared to be pleased; he said
that that day a large swarm of wild
geese had arrived from the north;
that they had lighted on the ponds
of the Three Sawmills; that he had
spied them afar off, and that the
shooting on the marshes was about
to begin. Benassis laughed and
rubbed his hands as he emptied his
glass of brandy and water. Every
one was listening to him. Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
Eustache said, if he went to shoot
them, he should go in a little skiff;
for as to putting on high boots and
going into the mire, at the risk of
sinking in above his ears, he would
not fancy that much. Then every
man had his say, and old Jeannette
musingly murmured to herself: “I
also owned marshes and ponds!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Nadasi, with a mocking
air, “listen to that: Dame Jeannette
used to own marshes....”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said she, “I did!...”</p>

<p>“Where were they, noble lady?”</p>

<p>“In La Vendée, on the sea-coast.”</p>

<p>And as Nadasi shrugged his shoulders,
as much as to say, The old woman
is crazy! Mme. Jeannette ascended
the little wooden staircase
at the back of the hovel, and then
came down again with a basket filled
with various articles, needles, thread,
bobbins, and yellow parchments,
which she deposited on the table.
“Here are our papers,” said she:
“the ponds, the marshes, and the
château are there with the other
things!... We laid claim to them
in the time of Louis XVIII., but my
relations denied our rights, because
I had married a republican. We
would have gone to law, but we had
no money to pay the lawyers. Is
it not so, Coustel, is it not true?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the turner, without
moving.</p>

<p>The persons assembled took no
interest in the thing, not any more
than they would have done in the
packages of paper money of the time
of the Republic, which may still be
found in old closets.</p>

<p>Nadasi, still mocking, opened one
of the parchments, and was raising
his head to read it, in order to laugh
at Jeannette, when suddenly his
countenance become grave; he wiped
his spectacles, and turning towards
the poor old woman, who had sat
down again to her spinning.</p>

<p>“Are these your papers, Mme.
Jeannette?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Will you allow me to look at
them a little?”</p>

<p>“You can do as you please with
them,” said she; “they are of no use
to us.”</p>

<p>Then Nadasi, who had turned pale,
folded up the parchment with several
others, saying: “I will see about
that.... It is striking nine o’clock;
good-night.”</p>

<p>He went away, and the rest soon
followed him.</p>

<p>Eight days after this, Nadasi set
out for La Vendée; he had obtained
from Coustel and Dame Jeannette his
wife their signature to a paper which
gave him full power to recover, alienate,
and sell all their property, taking
upon himself the expenses, with the
understanding that he was to be repaid
if he obtained the inheritance
for them.</p>

<p>Soon after a report was spread in
the village that Mme. Jeannette was
a noble lady, that she owned a château
in La Vendée, and that Coustel
would soon receive a large income;
but afterwards Nadasi wrote that he
had arrived six weeks too late; that
the own brother of Mme. Jeannette
had shown him papers which made
it as clear as the day that he had
held possession of the marshes for
more than thirty years; and that,
whenever one holds the property of
another for more than thirty years, it is
the same as if one had always had
it; so that Jean-Pierre Coustel and
his wife, on account of their relations
having thus enjoyed their property,
had no longer any claim to it.</p>

<p>These poor people, who had
thought themselves rich, and whom
all the village had gone, according
to custom, to congratulate and flatter,
when they found they were to
have nothing, felt their poverty still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
more keenly than before, and not
long afterwards they died within a
short time of each other, like Christians,
asking of the Lord pardon
for their sins, and confident in the
hope of eternal life.</p>

<p>Nadasi sold his post of bailiff, and
did not return to the country; doubtless
he had found some employment
which suited him better than serving
citations.</p>

<p>Many years had passed; Louis
Philippe had disappeared, then the
Republic; the couple Coustel slept
on the hillside, and I suppose even
their bones had crumbled into dust
in the grave. For my part, I had
succeeded my grandfather at the
post-house, and Uncle Eustache, as he
himself had said, had taken his passport,
when one morning, during the
gay season at Baden and Homburg,
there happened to me something
quite surprising, and of which I still
think frequently. Several post-chaises
had passed during the morning,
when, towards eleven o’clock, a courier
came to inform me that his
master, M. le Baron de Rosélière,
was approaching. I was at table. I
immediately rose to superintend the
relay of horses. Just as they were
being harnessed, a head was put out
of the coach-window&mdash;an old wrinkled
face, with hollow cheeks, and gold
spectacles on the nose&mdash;it was the
face of Nadasi, but old, faded, worn
out; behind him leaned the head of a
young girl; I was all astonishment.
“What is the name of this village?”
inquired the old man, yawning.</p>

<p>“Laneuville, sir.”</p>

<p>He did not recognize me, and
drew back. Then I saw an old lady
also in the coach. The horses were
harnessed: they set off.</p>

<p>What a surprise, and how many
ideas passed through my mind! Nadasi
was the Baron de Rosélière.
May God forgive me if I am wrong!
but I still think that he sold the
papers of poor Jeannette, and that
he assumed a noble name to ward
off the questions of the inquisitive.
What was there to prevent him?
Had he not obtained all the title-deeds,
all the papers, all the powers
of attorney? And now has he not
had the thirty years of possession?
Poor old Jeannette!... What
misery we meet with in this life!...
And God permits it all!...</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c571" name="c571"></a>The Doctrine of Hell, ventilated in
a Discussion between the Rev. C.
A. Walworth and William Henry
Burr</span>, Esq. New York: The Catholic
Publication Society. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a very small 18mo volume of
one hundred and fifty-one pages, containing
more solid matter than some large
octavos, as any person who knows F.
Walworth’s style of writing would naturally
expect. It contains a correspondence
between himself and the gentleman
whose name is given above, who was
a classmate of F. Walworth and one of
his fellow-members in the Presbyterian
church of Union College. This correspondence
appeared in the <i>Investigator</i>,
a notorious infidel newspaper of Boston,
and was called forth by an indignant
denial sent to that paper by F. Walworth
of a false and utterly groundless report
that he had refused submission to the decrees
of the Council of the Vatican. Mr.
Burr, who has renounced the errors of
Calvinism, and embraced those of infidelity
and spiritism, took occasion from
this denial and the explicit avowal of
perfect submission to all the doctrines
of Catholic faith involved in it, to question
his former classmate in regard to the
doctrine of eternal punishment, and to inquire
of him how far his present belief in
that doctrine agrees with his former belief
while a Presbyterian. This brought
on a controversy, in which Mr. Burr attempts
to argue against the Catholic doctrine
by ridiculing and denouncing certain
descriptions of the torments of hell
given by various writers, both Protestant
and Catholic, bringing in at the same
time a number of discursive and random
remarks about many other topics, which
are generally both very silly and altogether
irrelevant. F. Walworth, on his side,
steadily refuses to be drawn from the
proper subject of controversy, or to
permit his adversary to make him responsible
for the private opinions of any
person, Protestant or Catholic, and
adduces strong, solid, irrefutable arguments
from reason in support of the
strictly Catholic doctrine taught authoritatively
by the Church and obligatory on
all her members. The only point
which F. Walworth professes to aim at,
and toward which his argument is directed
with undeviating logic, is this.
The doctrine which the church authoritatively
teaches and imposes as obligatory
on the conscience of her children is not
contrary to reason, but in accordance
with it, and capable of being proved by
rational arguments. In his statement of
what that doctrine is, F. Walworth follows
Petavius, Perrone, and Archbishop
Kenrick with theological accuracy. He
says (pref., p. 9), “I have planted myself
simply and purely upon the defined doctrine
of the Catholic Church, and what
that doctrine necessarily involves.” This
is evidently to be understood of doctrine
as defined, in the more general sense of
definitely and precisely taught by the infallible
magistracy of the church, by
whatever method the church may exercise
this magistracy, and not to be restricted
to definitions <i>de fide</i> contained
in explicit decrees of popes and councils.
The logical deductions following
necessarily from that which is precisely
the article of Catholic faith are included
in the obligatory doctrine. And
where these deductions have not been
expressly drawn out and defined in ecclesiastical
decrees, the authority of the concurrent
teaching of theologians is acknowledged
in explicit terms by F. Walworth:
“Where any questions remain
undefined, I bow respectfully to the concurrent
opinions of [the church’s] leading
theologians. Beyond this I will not be
bound” (p. 47). He says further: “All
the language of Holy Scripture on the
subject must be accepted and maintained”
(Pref., p. 8), which is in accordance
with a monition of the last Council
of Baltimore to Catholic writers on this
subject. The same council also admonishes
Catholic writers not to diminish
the punishment of sin in such a way as
to destroy its proportion to the sin. And
if any one will examine what F. Walworth
has written, he will see that in this
respect also he has fulfilled the precept
of the Fathers of Baltimore to the letter.
The statement of the defined doctrine of
the church respecting hell made by F.
Walworth is precisely that of Petavius:
“There is a hell, and it is eternal.” Into
the question of the specific physical nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
and instrumental causes of the punishments
of hell he does not enter very
deeply. The only opinion of a Catholic
writer which he expressly opposes is
that of F. Furniss, that the torments of
hell increase in geometrical proportion
throughout eternity&mdash;an opinion which, so
far as we know, is not supported by any
grave authority. Opinions which are
matters of lawful difference and discussion
are left on their own proper ground
within the domain of theology. The
point to be proved is that reason cannot
show any valid objection to the doctrine
of the everlasting punishment of the
man who finishes his term of moral probation
on the earth in the state of mortal
sin. Mr. Burr produces no such objection.
His admissions even confirm the
truth of F. Walworth’s positions. He
admits that a state of intellectual and
moral degradation is in itself a state of
misery. The sinner is in this disordered
state when he dies. If he lives for ever in
the same state, this everlasting state of
existence is hell. But who can bring conclusive
evidence that there is any necessary
cause which must bring him out of
this state in the future life? Such evidence
not being forthcoming, reason has
not a word to say against the teaching of
revelation, that those who fail in their
earthly probation have no other, and
must abide for ever the consequences of
their own acts.</p>

<p>Some persons may object to the publication
of a controversy in which infidel
arguments are placed within the reach of
Catholic readers. In the present instance,
we think the cause of infidelity has alone
any reason to fear anything from Mr.
Burr’s letters. His reasonings are so
weak and rambling, and the replies of F.
Walworth so plain and conclusive, that
it must do good to any reader who has a
Christian belief to see what a wretched,
disgusting substitute for divine religion
is offered to the dupes of infidel sophistry.
Infidelity destroys the mind and the
manhood of the human being. In the
form of materialism, it makes him a
beast; in the form of spiritism, a lunatic.
We do not say that books of this kind
should be expressly placed in the hands
of all readers, especially children and
those who never read anything or hear
anything except what is good; but we
say to those who do hear and read the infidel
sophistry and blasphemy of the day,
and therefore need a refutation of it: Take
the two sides represented in this book&mdash;“Look
on this picture, and then look on
that.”</p>

<p>We must add that there are some most
beautiful passages in F. Walworth’s letters;
that, as a literary work, they are a
gem; and that the appendix on the universal
belief of mankind in hell, though
brief, is remarkably comprehensive and
valuable.</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c572a" name="c572a"></a>The Threshold of the Catholic
Church</span>: A Course of Plain Instructions
for those entering her Communion.
By Rev. John B. Bagshawe, Missionary
Rector of S. Elizabeth’s, Richmond.
With a Preface by the Right Rev. Monsignor
Capel. New York: The Catholic
Publication Society. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">The first part of this manual contains
instruction in the truths of faith; the second
part, on sacraments, rites, devotions
and similar matters. It is good for candidates
for admission into the Catholic
Church, for recent converts, and for clergymen,
religious ladies, teachers, and
others who have converts to instruct.</p>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap"><a id="c572b" name="c572b"></a>A Winged Word, and Other Stories.</span>
By M. A. T., author of <i>The House of
Yorke</i>. New York: The Catholic Publication
Society.</p>

<p class="p1">This collection of stories, already published
separately in <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span>, ought to be welcome to all readers
of taste and discernment. It is just
the book for summer reading, the only
companion one could bear in the retirement
of the woods, and one whose spirit
would never jar upon any of nature’s
moods. Fancy reading Miss Braddon
or Wilkie Collins under the forest canopy
or by the river bank! But here is a
book which, at every page, will help you
to put your own vague thoughts into
words, and will almost make you think
that you understand the song of the bobolink
and the chatter of the squirrel.
And yet it is a book full of human interest,
made up of human stories, and
treating of sorrow and want as well as of
joy and peace. If we did not know that
the authoress was a New Englander, we
should say she was a German, so subtle
and so spiritual are her principal characters,
so tender and so chaste her infinitely
varied language. There is no passion,
no stir, no sensation in her plots, and her
words do not pour forth like a lava torrent,
suggesting dangerous possibilities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
and caressing the animal instincts of our
lower nature, like too many of the successful
and popular authors of our day.
Reading her books, one experiences a
sense of coolness, and feels as if transported
to a white palace, where a crystal
fountain plays unceasingly, and the silent
silver bells of lilies hang in clusters over
the stream. It would fill all the space we
have at command to quote any of her
beautiful descriptions of scenes in the
woods or by the golden sea-shore; she
seems to have gone down into the heart
of every flower and learnt its secret, to
have lured the confidence of every brooklet,
and made every tree sing her some
woodland poem.</p>

<p>The stories themselves (except the last)
are the merest sketches, made to hang
beautiful thoughts upon, just as we plant
a slender pole for a scarlet vine to creep
over. Yet they are each of them very
original, such as only “M. A. T.” would
or could write.</p>

<p>One passage in “Daybreak” has been
criticised in the Philadelphia <i>Standard</i> as
containing the Nestorian heresy. It is
found on p. 183: “If you are willing, I
would like to teach her to bless herself before
praying, and to say a little prayer to the
Mother of Christ for your safety. I won’t
make her say ‘Mother of God.’” A little
attention to the context will make it perfectly
evident that this criticism is groundless,
and that any Catholic might use this
language in a similar instance with perfect
propriety. Mr. Granger and his
little daughter were Protestants. Margaret
had no right to teach the child anything
which was against the conscience
of her father. He was willing that she
should address the Blessed Virgin as the
Mother of Christ, but not that she should
use the term Mother of God. Mother of
Christ is a perfectly proper and orthodox
title, and is used by the Church in the
Litany of Loretto. Therefore, it was
right to teach the child to use it, with her
father’s permission, and to abstain from
teaching her to use the expression Mother
of God, which is really its precise
equivalent. S. Basil did not even require
certain persons who were estranged from
the Catholic fold through the Arian
heresy, but who wished to be admitted
to the communion of the Church, to
profess in express terms that the Holy
Ghost is God, but was satisfied with a
profession of his divinity in equivalent
terms. If an equivalent term may sometimes
be admitted in the case of Catholics,
much more may it be employed in teaching
those who are not Catholics. It is one
thing to use terms which are heretical,
another to use those which are less explicit,
but more easily understood by
those who do not know the true meaning
of the more explicit Catholic terms.</p>

<p>One of the stories in this collection,
“What Dr. Marks Died Of,” might have
been omitted without any loss to the volume.
It may easily be taken as a shot at
the medical profession, and if that was
the author’s aim, it is one which we cannot
approve. If it was not, the story is an
arrow in the air.</p>

Green &amp; Co. 1867. (New York: Sold

York: Sold by The Catholic Publication
Society.)</p>

<p class="p1">We have had frequent occasion of late
to notice with pleasure and to congratulate
our readers and the Catholic community
generally on the revival in England
of Catholic literature, and particularly of
that class of works which has a tendency
to illustrate the dark era of persecution
and proscription which, commencing under
the reign of Henry VIII., may be
said to have reached almost down to our
own day. In the last generation, Dr.
Lingard, by his impartial <i>History</i>, cleared
away a good deal of the rubbish with
which the deformities of the so-called
English Reformation were hidden from
view; subsequently, Lady Fullerton and
other distinguished writers of fiction attempted,
and with success, to gain the
attention of the public to their admirable
portraiture of the sufferings and fortitude
of the Catholics of England in the times
of Elizabeth and James I.; while the
erudite editor of the <i>Narrative of F.
Gerard</i> has, by his industry and conscientious
labors, placed all future historians
under a great debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>The works before us, though treating
of a different subject, and written by a
Protestant clergyman, have a tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
very similar to that produced by the writings
we have mentioned. The first is devoted
to a discussion of the question
whether the Protestant hierarchy in Ireland
can legally and historically claim
descent from the ancient church in Ireland;
or, in plainer terms, have the Anglican
bishops in that country ever been
consecrated at all, at any time, or by any
competent authority? In tracing up the
succession of the defunct “Establishment,”
the author gives very succinct
and accurate sketches of every incumbent,
Catholic and Protestant, of every
diocese in Ireland from the middle of the
XVIth century and proves by dates,
facts, and public documents that the
“reformed” prelates have no more right
to claim apostolic succession than they
have to claim to be the apostles themselves.
When we mention that Dr.
Brady is a beneficed clergyman, and was
formerly chaplain to the lord lieutenant,
our readers will have little hesitation in
accepting conclusions so damaging to
his own church, and which, as he tells us
himself, only the cause of truth could
have compelled him to publish.</p>

<p>The other book, though not so interesting,
is to us on this side of the Atlantic of
much greater value, as few of us have an
opportunity of consulting the originals.
It is a collection of state papers, letters,
documents, and petitions “touching the
mode in which it was sought to introduce
the Reformed religion into Ireland,”
and are all authenticated copies taken
from the records of the State Paper
Office in London. However much Dr.
Brady may have done by these publications
to damage the cause of Protestantism
in Ireland, and to humble
the pride of a faction that never has
and never can possess the respect or
affection of the people upon whom it has
so long preyed, he has deserved by his
fairness and courage the esteem and
thanks of all impartial lovers of historical
truth.</p>

<p>&mdash;Since the above was in type, we find
occasion for congratulating the author
upon having arrived at the conclusion to
which his investigations naturally led, <i>i.e.</i>,
his reception into the Catholic Church.</p>

London: John Philp. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This manual for ecclesiastics is highly
commended by the Abbé Dubois, an eminent
director of a seminary in France,
and an author of works specially intended
for priests, who calls it “the priest’s <i>Following

Shrewsbury, to whom it is dedicated by
the translator. A valuable appendix has
been added, containing a catalogue of
books for a priest’s library and for a mission,

It is enough to see Mr. Philp’s name as
publisher to know that it has been carefully,
neatly, and conveniently printed.</p>

Preface, by John Morris, S.J. London:
Burns &amp; Oates. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">There is a delicious quaintness about
these meditations. They are colloquies
with God and with self, and come from
the soul of a poet who “aspired to and
attained martyrdom.” A sketch of the
saintly author has recently appeared in
<span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span> (“Poet and Martyr,”
April, 1873), so that it is needless to
give one here. But the frontispiece of
the volume before us is a portrait of F.
Southwell, which is valuable.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Only a Pin</i>, but an exceedingly valuable
one, pointing a moral keenly and
sharply; having a head secure and sound,
not likely to be turned by any accidental
twist; altogether a well-manufactured pin,
straight and strong, not weakly bending
this way and that to serve illegitimate
uses, but made in the best factory and of
good metal; a pin belonging to the first
and oldest family in Pindom, and sure
to make its mark in the literary world.</p>

<p>We often hear the expression “not
worth a row of pins,” but a row like this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
pin would be far from worthless. One
would hardly expect to become interested
in the events brought about by so
small an article as a pin; yet the accomplished
author has managed to engage
attention most agreeably from the first
chapter to the last.</p>

<p>The translation is in the main very
natural and easy, but now and then a
sentence seems a little careless or obscure.</p>

Perpetua</span>; or, The Martyrs of Carthage.
By R. De Mericourt. Translated
from the Second French Edition. New
York: P. O’Shea. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">The heroine of this story is S. Perpetua,
the companion of S. Felicitas. The story
is well conceived and powerfully written.
We have not seen the original, but the
translation shows an experienced and
competent hand, and has the great merit
of reading as if the book had been composed
in English. There are, however, a
number of inaccuracies in respect to
names, some careless sentences, and
other blemishes of style, some of which
may be due to incorrect proof-reading, as
the errors evidently typographical are
numerous. For instance, the Pontifex
Maximus is called the Pontiff Maximus,
and in one place two Christian converts
are called “convicts.” Such an admirable
story as this is, with its thrilling
delineations of Christian heroism and
pagan cruelty, ought to pass through
more than one edition. If it does, we
hope the publisher will have its clerical
errors corrected by a competent
hand, and the press-work more carefully
performed, so as to make the book in all
respects <i>comme il faut</i>. If this is intended
as the first of a series, the project is one
worthy of commendation.</p>

<p>Since the foregoing was put in type,
we have ascertained that the story as it
appeared in French was “imitated from
the English,” which, we are informed,
means that it was a free translation of an
English book. This accounts for certain
omissions which appear rather singular
in a Catholic tale of this sort. No mention
is made of the altar, the sacrifice of
the Mass, or holy communion. The explanations
of Christian doctrine and the
answers to Vivia’s objections are not complete
and satisfactory. M. de Mericourt
has taken care, however, that nothing
contrary to Catholic doctrine should be
admitted, and as the events of the story
do not require any minute description of
Christian doctrine or worship, the omissions
noted do not essentially detract
from its character as a portraiture of Christian
virtue in the midst of the dangers
and trials of pagan life.</p>

New York: P. O’Shea. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This new volume contains the splendid
refutation of High-Church and Tractarian
theories which appeared at the height of
the Oxford movement in the <i>Dublin Review</i>.
Few persons have ever convinced
so many and such able antagonists by an
argument as the great cardinal did in this
case. If it were possible to obtain the
little volume on the last illness and
death of the cardinal, printed in England
for private circulation, to be published
with this collection of his works, the
Catholic community would feel itself
very much favored. The cardinal was a
holy man, as well as a great prelate. We
have had the pleasure of reading the
beautiful account of his last illness and
saintly death in the little volume alluded
to, and we cannot help thinking that its
publication would be an act of great propriety
and utility, unless there is some
reason for reserving it for a place in a
large and full biography.</p>

<p>&mdash;Before going to press, we have noticed
among the English announcements that
the work above referred to has been published.</p>

<p class="p1">It is superfluous to praise Conscience’s

interesting, and published in a very nice
and attractive form, which makes them as
pretty little volumes for prizes as boy or

<p class="p1">This is a crude hodge-podge of facts
which the author has picked up here and
there, in which he utterly fails to distinguish
between the natural, the diabolical,
and the divine. He has read some
Catholic works, and is to some extent
familiar with the lives of the saints; but the

his ignorance in a stronger light. What
a pity it is that educated men should be
ignorant of what a child can so easily

VIII. with Philip le Bel, the affair of the
Templars, the great schism of Avignon,
the condemnation of Galileo, the suppression
of the Jesuits, and several other
topics, are discussed in these able lectures
in a critical and erudite manner, in
so far as space and the other conditions
to which the nature of his discourses subjected
the author, have given him the
opportunity. The whole is preceded by
an essay on the doctrine of the supremacy,
and concluded by a short eulogium on
Pius IX. The author is a graduate of the
Roman College, and imbued with the
sound scholarship and orthodox spirit of
that institution, the headquarters of sacred
science, which may God deliver from the
impure horde who are now defiling its precincts
by their odious presence! There
are a great number of intelligent Catholic
laymen seeking with anxiety at the
present time for clear, satisfactory information
on just these topics which the
Laval professor has handled in the lectures
now published. It is a pity that
they are accessible to those only who
read French. If the Quebec publisher
would issue an edition in English, we
are inclined to think that the sale in England
and the United States would reimburse
him. The lectures on the Syllabus,
noticed in this magazine some months
ago, are also worth translating, and the
publication of two such courses in the
English language would most certainly
bring great honor to the Laval University.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“For neither in our own age nor in those of our fathers and grandfathers has any ecclesiastic
been known to be so richly endowed with virtues, on whom so great reliance could be placed, or
who enjoyed a greater degree of authority. Even his opponents admit him to have been a man of
vast learning in numerous branches.... This was especially the case in respect of the Holy
Scriptures, and in the knowledge of which it is a general belief that there had not existed for ages
any one at all his equal. He evinced a profound judgment, not only in literature, but in the ordinary
affairs of life.... The confidence he inspired was marvellous.”&mdash;<i>Guicciardini, Storia Inedita
di Firenze.</i></p>

<p class="pbq">“ ... Of such a man one ought never to speak but with reverence.”&mdash;<i>Machiavelli, Discorsi.</i></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Charles VIII</span>. crossed the Alps at
the head of an army of 22,000 infantry
and 24,000 cavalry&mdash;admirably
armed and appointed for that period.
They had thirty-six cannons, of
which the wonder was related that
they were drawn by horses, the guncarriages
having four wheels, two of
which could be detached when they
went into battery. To these forces were
to be joined those of Ludovico the
Moor, Duke of Milan, who had
specially urged the coming of Charles.
To such an army as this, the Italians
feared that all the armies of Italy,
even if they could be consolidated,
could offer no effectual resistance.
They were in wretched condition,
both as to men and commanders,
and the famous <i>condottieri</i> had degenerated
into mere consumers of
pay and rations.</p>

<p>Under the able diplomacy of
Lorenzo, the most friendly relations
had been cultivated with France,
and Charles VIII. was inclined to
treat Tuscany more as an ally than
an enemy. But Piero, with characteristic
ineptness, manifested a preference
for Naples, and alienated the
French king. The indignation of
the Florentines was intense when
they found that Piero’s course was
likely to bring an army of invasion
within their walls; for the French
advance was already marked by the
brutal massacres of the people of
Rapallo and Fivizzano after the garrisons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
had surrendered. Having
separated his cause from that of the
citizens, and without men and means
to oppose the French, the frightened
Piero set out for the king’s camp to
sue for peace. Charles had yet to
pass on his way to Florence three
strongholds, Sarzanello, Sarzano, and
Pietra Santa, any one of which with
a small force could hold a powerful
army in check. When Piero reached
the French lines, Charles had been
besieging Sarzanello for three days
without success. The invaders were
in a barren country, shut in between
the mountains and the sea. In point
of fact, they were poorly commanded;
the French king himself was a model
of stupid indolence and neglect,
and they might easily have been
driven back in confusion. And yet
the panic-stricken Piero, without
consulting the ambassadors who accompanied
him, immediately yielded
to all the conditions demanded by
Charles, and even more; for he surrendered
at once the three formidable
fortresses, besides those of Pisa and
Leghorn, and agreed, moreover, to a
forced loan of 200,000 ducats from
Florence. The fortresses thus given
up had been gained by long sieges
and enormous sums of money, and
were the military keys of Tuscany.
Naturally enough, the news of their
surrender aroused the Florentines to
anger, which was intensified by what
they heard from the ambassadors of
the conduct of Piero. Excitement
spread throughout the city. All business
was suspended. Groups in the
public places soon swelled to crowds.
Fierce and angry-looking men were
seen bearing weapons but partially
concealed. Daggers were brandished
that had not seen the light of day
since the Pazzi conspiracy. Artisans
of all trades, and in particular the
<i>ciómpi</i>, the strong-armed wool-combers,
abandoned their workshops,
recalling their former triumphs under
Michele di Lando in the days of the
republic. But the old friends of
popular liberty among the higher
classes had, during the past sixty
years, all melted away in exile or
persecution, and there was every excess
and atrocity to be feared from
an enraged multitude just freed from
servitude, and making no concealment
of their threats against those who
had become wealthy and powerful
by oppressing them. Such
crowds as these raged through the
streets of Florence, when a sermon
from Savonarola was announced
at the <i>Duomo</i>. A dense mass of
people soon filled it, and Savonarola
from his place looked down on a
human powder-magazine in which the
smallest spark in shape of an imprudent
word would create explosion
and spread dire disaster. If “turbulent,
priestly demagogue” there
were, this was the moment and
this the place to find him.</p>

<p>What said Savonarola?</p>

<p>Not a word of their complaints or
their wrongs, past or present; not
the slightest allusion to Piero or to
the Medici; but, bending over the
pulpit with outstretched arms, and
looking into the mass of upturned
faces with gaze of affection and expression
of tenderest sympathy, he
poured out words of peace, union,
and charity: “Behold, the sword has
descended, the scourges have commenced,
the prophecies are being fulfilled;
behold the Lord, who is leading
on those armies. O Florence! the
time for music and dancing is at an
end: now is the time for pouring out
rivers of tears over your sins. Thy
crimes, O Florence! thy crimes, O
Rome! thy crimes, O Italy! are the
cause of these chastisements. Behold,
then, give alms, offer up prayers,
be a united people. O my people!
I have been to thee as a father;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
I have labored throughout my life to
make thee know the truth of faith,
and how to lead a good life, and have
met with nothing but tribulation,
scorn, and opprobrium. I might have
had this compensation at least, that I
might have seen thee performing some
good deeds. My people, have I ever
shown any other desire than to see
thee in safety, to see thee united?
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is
at hand. But that I have said many
times. I have so often cried out to
thee, I have so often wept for thee,
O Florence! that it might have sufficed
thee. I turn, then, to thee,
Lord; pardon this people, who desire
to be thine.” He then went on enjoining
charity and faith with an
energy overflowing more with affection
than eloquence, and the crowd
who entered the <i>Duomo</i> a raging multitude,
left it in peaceful procession.</p>

<p>Old Gino Capponi, a man resolute
in word and deed, arose in a meeting
of the signiory, and said: “The republic
must look to itself; <i>it is high
time to get rid of being governed by
children</i>. Let ambassadors be sent
to King Charles, and, if they meet
Piero, let them not salute him. Let
commanding officers and troops be
called in, and, while kept out of sight
in cloisters and other places, hold
themselves in readiness, so that, while
nothing is wanting in honorable dealing
with the king, we yet stand prepared
to resist designs to which we
should not submit. And above
everything, do not fail to send with
the ambassadors the Padre Girolamo
Savonarola, to whom the people are
so entirely devoted.”</p>

<p>Capponi’s suggestions were all
adopted. The embassy was sent,
Savonarola following it on foot&mdash;his
usual mode of travelling. The other
ambassadors were coldly received by
the king, and immediately returned
to Florence with the assurance that
his majesty was by no means well
disposed towards the republic. Savonarola
reached the French camp,
and, passing through the soldiery,
soon came in presence of the king,
seated among his generals. He was
courteously received, and, with slight
preamble, thus addressed Charles in
a loud and commanding tone:
“Most Christian king, thou art an
instrument in the hand of the Lord,
who sends thee to deliver Italy from
her afflictions, as for many years I
have predicted, and sends thee to reform
the church, which lies prostrate
in the dust. But if thou be not just
and merciful; if thou pay not respect
to the city of Florence, to its women,
its citizens, its liberty; if thou dost
forget the work for which the Lord
sends thee, he will then select
another to fulfil it, and will let the
hand of his wrath fall upon thee, and
will punish thee with awful scourges.
These things I say to thee in the
name of the Lord.”</p>

<p class="pc1">EXPULSION OF THE MEDICI.</p>

<p class="p1">Meantime, serious events had occurred
in Florence. The reports of
the returning ambassadors had produced
still greater excitement. Piero
de’ Medici had attempted to regain
possession of the government, but
had failed, was hooted at, mobbed,
driven from the city, and a price set
upon his head. <i>Palle! palle!</i><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> once
the all-powerful rallying-cry of the
Medici in Florence, fell dead on the
ears of the people. The Medicean
palace was seized, and the houses of
Cardinal de’ Medici, and of Guidi
and Miniati, confidential agents of
the Medici, were sacked. The turbulent
mob appeared disposed to
proceed to still greater lengths, when
Savonarola returned from his mission
to the French camp, again preaching
charity, union, and peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<p>His bold language had profoundly
impressed the French king, who resolved
to be guided by what the
monk had said, and on the 17th of
November, 1494, at the head of a
portion of his army, some 12,000
men, he made a peaceful entry into
the city of Florence. Meanwhile,
Capponi, resolved to be prepared for
the worst, had laid in good store of
munitions of war in buildings where
he held reserves of soldiery, in cloisters
and courtyards. Materials for
barricading the streets were provided,
and all were ordered to come forth
armed at the first sound of the bell.
His precautions were timely.</p>

<p class="pc1">CHARLES ENTERS FLORENCE.</p>

<p class="p1">The reception of the French king
was magnificent, and, after the ceremonies,
feasts, and illuminations attendant
upon it, he was sumptuously
installed in the Medicean palace.
Here the wife and the mother of
Piero de’ Medici contrived to negotiate
with him for the restoration of
the Medicean rule. Tempting offers
were made him: Piero was to be
brought back, and the government
of Florence was to be shared with
the king. The effect of all this was
soon visible in the extravagance of
the demands made by Charles upon
the Florentines. The signiory resisted;
the king refused to recede, and
gave them his <i>ultimatum</i>. On its
rejection by the syndics, he said, in
a threatening tone: “Then we shall
sound our trumpets.” “And we,”
instantly replied Capponi, springing
to his feet&mdash;“and we will ring our
bells.”</p>

<p>Charles thought better of it, and
the treaty was shortly afterwards
signed. It recognized the republic,
and gave the king the sum of 120,000
florins in three instalments.
The treaty ratified, still the king
lingered. Troubles arose. Collisions
had taken place between the soldiery
and the citizens; robbery and murder
were of nightly occurrence; shops
were closed, and trade generally suspended.
The worst consequences
were feared, and Savonarola, fully
occupied in preaching peace and
warding off dangers, was implored
to use his influence with the French
king, and persuade him to depart.
He immediately presented himself
before Charles, who, surrounded by
his nobles, graciously received him.</p>

<p>“Most Christian prince,” said the
monk, “thy stay causes great damage
to this city and to thy enterprise.
Thou losest time, forgetting the
duty that Providence hath imposed
upon thee, to the great injury of thine
own spiritual welfare and the world’s
glory. Listen, then, to the servant
of God. Proceed on thy way without
further tarrying. Do not desire
to bring ruin on this city, nor provoke
the anger of the Lord.” A few
days afterwards, the king and his
army departed.</p>

<p class="pc1">THE REPUBLIC.</p>

<p class="p1">Great was the joy of the Florentines
to be rid of the foreigner and
his armed legions. Short as had
been his stay, it left profound traces.
Pisa, Arezzo, and Montepulciano had
risen in rebellion. The enormous
sums paid to the French king had
drained the resources of the city.
The wealthy were impoverished, and
misery spread among the poorer
classes. Savonarola proposed, first
of all, to provide for the wants of
these last, and to take up collections
for them. If they proved insufficient,
to turn into ready money the plate
and ornaments of the churches; to
reopen the shops without delay; to
lighten the taxes, especially to the
lower classes; and, finally, to pray to
God with fervor.</p>

<p>A <i>parlamento</i>, or assemblage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
the people, was now held to establish
the new government. Without experience
or sufficient knowledge on
their part, it resulted in the re-establishment
of the old magistrates, and
the maintenance of the old forms so
cunningly devised by the Medici,
that, while the people possessed the
outward show of an independent
government, it was one which from
its nature could easily be wielded at
the will of one man. These defects
soon became apparent, and various
propositions for reform were forthwith
made at the Palazzo. Differences
were represented by two parties,
headed respectively by Paolo Antonio
Soderini, and Guido Antonio
Vespucci. Soderini was of the popular
party, and preferred the form of
government at Venice as the best
model for the Florentines to adopt,
stipulating that, instead of limiting
the Grand Council, as in Venice, it
should be composed of the whole
people, and a smaller council called,
composed of the <i>ottimati</i>, or men of
experience. Vespucci argued strongly
against the democratic features of
Soderini’s proposition. It was evident
that he carried with him the
majority at the Palazzo, and among
them, naturally enough, many recent
partisans of the Medici. While the
debates grew warmer and longer,
many citizens feared the result, and
appealed to Savonarola for counsel.
He, too, saw the danger even more
clearly than they, and resolved to
give the counsel asked. The interference
of holy and religious people
in political affairs was no new thing
in Italy. S. Dominic had participated
in affairs of state in Lombardy;
peace had been effected between
the Guelphs and Ghibellines by a
cardinal; S. Catherine of Sienna interfered
to raise the interdict pronounced
on Florence by Gregory
XI.; and S. Antonino, the former
Archbishop of Florence, had more
than once interposed to prevent the
passage of unjust laws.</p>

<p>On the third Sunday in Advent
(Dec. 12, 1494), in the course of his
thirteenth sermon on Aggeus, Savonarola
spoke to the people of government,
discussed its general nature,
the advantages of its several forms,
and what was best for them; and concluded
this ought to be the groundwork:
that no individual shall have
any benefit but such as is general, and
<i>the people alone must have the power
of choosing the magistrates, and of approving
the laws</i>.</p>

<p>In a subsequent sermon at the
<i>Duomo</i>, to which he invited all the
magistrates and people except women
and children, he presented the
four following propositions:</p>

<p>First. They should in all things
have the fear of God before them,
and there should be a reform of
manners.</p>

<p>Second. All considerations of private
utility should yield to the public
good and the cause of popular
government.</p>

<p>Third. General amnesty absolving
the friends of the late government
from all blame, and remitting all
penalties, with indulgence to those
who were indebted to the state.</p>

<p>Fourth. Establish a general government
which should include all
citizens who, according to the ancient
statutes, formed a part of the state,
recommending the form of the Grand
Council at Venice as best adapted,
modifying it to suit the peculiar character
of the Florentine people.</p>

<p>This effectually disposed of the
plan of Vespucci, which would otherwise
have prevailed at the Palazzo,
leaving Florence under a patrician
government which might ripen into
despotism, or be the ever-frequent
provocation of fresh disorders and
revolutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc1">SAVONAROLA ON GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p class="p1">There is nothing more remarkable
in Savonarola’s character and career
than the familiarity displayed by him
with the principles and practical
working of government, as manifested
by his writings and sermons
during the course of the debates and
struggles attendant upon the formation
of the new republic. On all the
proposals or modifications of fundamental
laws, the popular party
would enter into no discussion, nor
take any decisive step, until Savonarola
had spoken. And it was remarked
that, during the discussions
which followed in the Consiglio and
other assemblies, the new law itself,
or arguments pro or con for a
change or abrogation of the old,
were presented by those who spoke in
the very words in which he had discussed
the matter in his sermons.
It would indeed be matter of legitimate
surprise that a monk whose
whole time was, as we have seen,
fully occupied with the duties of his
station, should possess even slight
command of a subject so foreign to
his calling, were it not that we are
apprised of the sources of Savonarola’s
knowledge. They lay in his
profound study of S. Thomas Aquinas
for the principles, and in his keen
personal observation for the practice,
of government. To the treatise <i>De
Regimine Principium</i> he is largely
indebted for his theory of popular
government. No modern writer has
pointed out the evils of tyrannical
government more clearly than S.
Thomas Aquinas, and none more
clearly than he has shown that government
to be the best which tends
most to the moral, intellectual, and
material interests of the people, and
includes the largest number of citizens
under its protection. We sincerely
regret that our restricted limits will
not permit the citation of numerous
passages from “the Angelic Doctor”
upon this subject, clothed in to-day’s
English; they might much
more readily be taken for the lucubrations
of an advanced political
thinker of 1873 than for those of an
ecclesiastic of 1273. And we would
express the same regret as to the
work of Savonarola&mdash;his <i>Treatise on
Government</i>.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Throughout the entire
range of modern literature, comments
on Machiavelli’s <i>Il Principe</i>
are so constantly dinned in our ears
that one might suppose the Italy of
that day to have been in profound
ignorance even theoretically of the
principles of free government. Savonarola’s
treatise is the antidote
of Machiavelli’s <i>Prince</i>. There are
passages in it from which it might
be concluded that he not only saw
the necessities of actual democratic
governments, but also foresaw the
dangers of those not yet in existence.
Thus: “Not wealth, as we commonly
believe, is the cause why an individual
attains the headship of a state.
Rather the cause lies in this: that an
individual attains to overwhelming
influence and exclusive consideration
in the state by the possession and
distribution of public offices and
dignities. To deprive individuals of
this power is the first stipulation of a
popular government, which demands
that no law and no tax, no office
nor honor, should be conferred or
become valid without the consent
of the whole people. But in order
that the whole people shall not be
collected together on every occasion,
this right will be vested in a certain
number of citizens,” etc. And he
concludes with this passage: “As
in everything, so likewise in the
state spiritual force is the best and
worthiest of ruling powers. Hence
it is that, even from the beginning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
a still imperfect state of government
will flourish in complete security,
and with time acquire perfection; if
it is always universally acknowledged
that the end of all Christian states is
the improvement of the citizens by
the withdrawing of all obscenity and
all wickedness, and that the truly
Christian life subsists in the fear of
God; if, moreover, the law of the
Gospel is esteemed as the measure
and rule of civil life and of all laws
that are made; if, further, all citizens
show a true love of their country;
if, finally, a general peace shall
have been concluded among the
citizens, all past injustice of the
former government forgiven, and all
older hatred forgotten&mdash;such unity
makes strong within, secure and
feared without.”</p>

<p class="pc1">SAVONAROLA’S CIVIL REFORMS.</p>

<p class="p1">The first measures decreed by the
new government proved superior intelligence
in political matters. The
ancient laws of the city were found
in such confusion that even judges
and officials were not aware of the
extent of their duties or their jurisdiction.
It was ordered that these laws
should be consolidated in one volume,
or, as we would say nowadays,
codified. Savonarola then insisted
on a reform in the system of taxation,
which, under the Medici, was not
only onerous and clumsy in application,
but unjust in its distribution.
The so-called <i>catasto</i>, or system of
assessing taxes on the supposed profits
of trade and commerce, was not
only exhausting but absolutely destructive
of many branches of trade
and industry, at once ruining those
who pursued them, and drying up
the sources of wealth to the state.
“Lay the taxes solely on property,”
said Savonarola. “Put an end to the
continual loans and all arbitrary imposts.”
And he recommended a
new system&mdash;one devised with so
much prudence, says Villari, so much
wisdom, and on such sound principles,
that it has continued to be
acted upon ever since. This new
law established a tax on property for
the first time in Florence, and also for
the first time in any part of Italy; it
put an end to all loans and arbitrary
assessments, and obliged every citizen,
without distinction, to pay ten
per cent. of the income he derived
from permanent property.</p>

<p>A general amnesty for political
offences was next decreed, and many
penalties assessed were remitted.
Among the latter was one of June
8, 1495, which possesses a certain
historical interest: “The magnificent
signiory and Gonfalonieri, considering
that Messer Dante Alighieri,
great-grandson of the poet Dante,
has not been able to return to this
city, from his want of means to pay
the taxes imposed by the signiory in
the past November and December,
and they being of opinion that it is
very fitting that some mark of gratitude
should be shown, through his
descendants, to a poet who is so great
an ornament to this city, be it enacted
that the said Messer Dante may
consider himself free, and hereby is
free, from every sentence of outlaw,
exile, etc.”</p>

<p>Savonarola next drew public attention
to the sore need of a <i>Monte di
Pietà</i>&mdash;an institution to which the
poor could resort in pecuniary stress
for a temporary loan of money on
objects pledged. By reason of the
absence of such an establishment,
and the popular indignation against
the Jews, from whom the needy were
obliged to borrow, serious disturbances
had broken out under Piero
de’ Medici; but the poor were no
better off than before, and the necessity
of some aid for them was a
crying one. It was officially ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
that there were Jews in Florence
who lent money at 32-1/2 per
cent., with compound interest, so that
a loan of one hundred florins on their
terms would in fifty years amount to
49,792,556 florins.</p>

<p>Savonarola urged the subject vehemently
from the pulpit, without,
however, attacking the Jews. He
desired they should be converted,
not persecuted. A law was passed
(Dec. 28, 1495) establishing a
<i>Monte</i>. Expenses of the institution
were not to exceed 600 florins per
annum; interest to be paid by the
borrower not to exceed six per cent.;
and borrowers were required to take
an oath that they would not gamble
with the money so lent. Thus, with
a fairer administration of justice, a
radical reform in taxation, the abrogation
of usury, the permanent relief
of the poor, the liberty to carry arms,
the abolition of the Parlamento, and
the establishment of the Consiglio
Maggiore, it may be said that the
freedom of the Florentine people was
obtained without bloodshed or riot in
a single year. The American traveller
of to-day who visits Florence will
remark on the platform in front of
the Palazzo Vecchio the admirable
statue of Judith slaying Holofernes&mdash;the
work of the immortal Donatello.
It was placed there at this time as a
symbol of the triumph of liberty over
tyranny. On its pedestal are inscribed
these words: <i>Exemplum sal:
pub: cives posuere MCCCCXCV</i>.
(“The citizens placed this symbol of
the public safety, in the year 1495”).
If the man who was the soul of this
great movement had been a great
soldier or potentate, his name would
have been handed down to posterity
as that of a new Lycurgus. But he
was a simple white-robed monk, with
no other insignia of rank or authority
than his persuasive word and the example
of his pure life. Neither in
the public places nor the meetings
of deliberation and discussion was he
ever seen, nor had he any system of
secret influence or hidden working.
Of seeking any personal advantage
or emolument no one ever thought
of seriously accusing him.</p>

<p>All he thought and had to say on
matters of public weal he announced
publicly in the pulpit. To those
who complained of undue clerical
influence in secular matters, and
hinted at the desire of a monk to
govern a republic, he replied that in
its trouble he held it to be his duty
to give advice to the new state, especially
when so many in the council
feared to proclaim the truth. More
he had not done. Seeking to lead
men to propriety and justice is not
meddling. Such participation in
civil affairs is neither unworthy itself
of a priest nor without example in
history, ancient or modern. He had
gone no further than to denounce
open abuses, to encourage men to
what was good and peaceful, and to
preach the Gospel. “I have said to
you,” he tells them in one of his sermons,
“that I will not mix in government
affairs, but only labor therein
to preserve complete the general
peace. To recommendations of individuals
or similar solicitations I
never yield. Go with these to the
proper officials. I also say here
openly, if any of my friends should
be recommended to you, deal no
otherwise with him than according
to justice. Yet once more: I do not
meddle with state affairs; I wish
only that the people should remain
in peace, and receive no injury.”</p>

<p>Perfect, Savonarola’s work certainly
was not, for there was in it the
germ of an oligarchic power which
at a later day worked like a principle
of corruption. Savonarola himself
would have wished it more complete.
It has been sought to throw personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
ridicule upon the great Dominican,
and to deny him any marked
political eminence; but when we
gather the opinions of three great
Florentines who lived after him, who
were not his disciples, and who were
eminently qualified to judge the subject-matter
in question, moderns
and foreigners may properly remain
silent. We refer to Machiavelli,
Guicciardini, and Gianotti. Of Savonarola
personally, Machiavelli frequently
spoke in terms of sarcasm
and irony, although in his writings
he refers, to “the learning, the prudence,
and the purity of his mind.”
He describes him (<i>Decennale Primo</i>)
as “breathing divine virtue”; and
again he says: “Of such a man one
ought never to speak but with reverence.”
He admits the great importance
of the institutions founded by
Savonarola, and tells Leo X. there is
no other way to bring the state of
Florence into order than by the restoration
of the Consiglio Maggiore&mdash;the
council for the establishment
of which Savonarola struggled with
such pertinacity. Gianotti, a noble
patriot twice exiled, who made special
study of the subject of government,
says: “He who established the
Consiglio Grande was a far wiser man
than Giano della Bella, because the
latter thought of securing the liberties
of the people by humbling the great,
whereas the object of the other was
to secure the liberties of all,” and
is elsewhere enthusiastic in his admiration
of Savonarola. Guicciardini
the pompous historian and diplomat,
and Guicciardini composing in the
privacy of his study, are two different
writers. It is not in his <i>Storia d’Italia</i>
that we must look for his real sentiments
on certain subjects. The diplomat
holds the pen there. But in his
<i>Ricordi</i>, published long after his
death, he says: “Such was the love
of the Florentines for the liberty
conferred upon them in 1494 that no
arts, no soothings, no cunning devices
of the Medici, ever sufficed to make
them forget it; that there was a time
when it might have been easy, when
it was a question of depriving the
few of their liberty; but, after the
Consiglio Grande, it was the deprivation
of liberty to all.” Elsewhere he
says: “You are under heavy obligations
to this friar, who stayed the
tumult in good time, and accomplished
that which without him could
only have been attained through
bloodshed and the greatest disorders.
You would first have had a government
of patricians, and then an unbridled
popular government, giving
rise to disturbances and shedding of
blood, and probably ending in the
return of Piero de’Medici. Savonarola
alone had the wisdom, from the outset,
to arrest the coming storm by
liberal measures.” Finally, in his
<i>Storia di Firenze</i>, he has none but the
most enthusiastic terms of praise for
the prudence, the practical and political
genius, of the friar, and calls him
the saviour of his country.</p>

<p class="pc1">THE SERMONS AGAIN.</p>

<p class="p1">The great questions of government
which then agitated Florence did not
for a moment distract Savonarola’s
attention from the duty of preaching
practical Christian duties. After the
course of sermons on Aggeus, he
preached on the Psalms, for the Lenten
course of 1495 on Job, resuming
the Psalms after Lent. Solid teaching
and vehement admonition were
never absent, and the sermons of
1494 were quite as strongly marked
by those features as those of the first
course at the <i>Duomo</i>, in one of which
he tells his hearers: “How have you
renounced the devil and his pomps&mdash;you
who every day do his works?
You do not attend to the laws of
Christ, but to the literature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
Gentiles. Behold, the Magi have
abandoned paganism, and come to
Christ, and you, having abandoned
Christ, run to paganism. You have
left the manna and the bread of
angels, and you have sought to satiate
your appetite with the food that is
fit for swine. Every day avarice augments,
and the vortex of usury is
enlarged. Luxury has contaminated
everything; pride ascends even to
the clouds; blasphemies pierce the
ears of Heaven; and scoffing takes
place in the very face of God. You
(who act thus) are of the devil, who
is your father, and you seek to do the
will of your father. Behold those
who are worse than the Jews; and
yet to us belong the sacred Scriptures,
which speak against them....
Many are the blind who say our
times are more felicitous than the
past ages, but I think, if the Holy
Scriptures are true, our lives are not
only not like those of our fathers of
former times, but they are at variance
with them.... Cast your eyes on
Rome, which is the chief city of the
world, and lower your gaze to all
her members, and, lo! from the
crown of the head to the sole of the
foot, no health is there.</p>

<p>“We are in the midst of Christians,
we converse with Christians, but they
are not Christians who are so only
in name; far better would it be in
the midst of pagans.... For now
men have become lovers of themselves;
covetous, haughty, proud,
profane, disobedient, ungrateful,
given to ribaldry, without love, without
peace, censorious, incontinent,
spiteful, without benignity, treacherous
persons, deceivers, puffed-up,
lovers of voluptuousness more than
that of God, <i>who have the form of
righteousness, but who deny the value
of it</i>.”</p>

<p>More than ever the people hung
upon his words. Numbers came
from Pisa, Leghorn, and the neighboring
cities to hear him; many
also from as far as Bologna, to remain
in Florence during Lent. Residents
of the neighboring villages
and hamlets, and mountaineers from
the Apennines, filled the roads to
Florence on Saturdays and the eves
of feast days; and, when the city
gates were opened at dawn of day
on Sunday morning, crowds were
there waiting entrance. Strangers
thus coming were received with brotherly
charity, and the duties of Christian
hospitality were observed. Even
in winter, the people of Florence rose
from their beds after midnight, in
order to reach the <i>Duomo</i> in time
to secure a place, and then waited in
church, taper in hand, praying, singing
hymns, or reciting the office, for
hours together. The cathedral could
not contain his audience. Seats
were put up in an amphitheatre to
increase the space. Men and boys
swarmed on the pillars and every
point where it was possible to obtain
a position. Even the piazza was
full.</p>

<p>All these remarkable manifestations
were not without results. Florence
became a changed city. Not
only were churches assiduously attended,
but alms were freely given.
Women laid aside their rich ornaments
and expensive jewels, and
dressed with simplicity. Light and
careless carriage or demeanor was
rare. Habits of prayer and spiritual
reading in the houses of the Florentines
became the rule rather than the
exception. The obscene carnival
songs of the Medicean period were
no longer heard in the streets, but, in
their place, lauds or hymns. At the
hour of mid-day rest, the artisan or
tradesman might be seen reading the
Bible or some pamphlet by Savonarola,
and young men of noted licentious
or frivolous habits became models<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
of good conduct. Fast days
were observed with such rigor that,
in justice to the butchers, the tax on
their calling was lowered. Men and
women of disedifying or tepid life
became religious&mdash;among them men
of mature age, distinguished in letters,
science, and public affairs. Such
young men as the Strozzi, the
Salviati, the Gondi, and the Accaiuoli
joined the friars of S. Mark and
other religious orders. Restitution
of ill-gotten gains or property was
common. But the most wonderful
thing of all, says a historian, was to
find bankers and merchants refunding,
from scruples of conscience, sums
of money, amounting sometimes to
thousands of florins, which they had
unrighteously acquired.</p>

<p class="pc1">PROPHESIES HIS OWN DEATH.</p>

<p class="p1">Still Savonarola pressed on in his
work of conversion as though it had
just begun. His followers had prepared
themselves for a joyful tone
of victory in his sermons by reason
of his brilliant civic triumphs, and
were ready to rend the air with their
alleluias. But he, on the contrary,
seemed more serious, more sad, than
ever, and, in his first discourse after
the events we have just related,
opened with an allegory full of sorrowful
forebodings, and the prophecy
of his own violent death:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“A young man, leaving his father’s
house, went to fish in the sea; and the
master of the vessel took him, while he
was fishing, far into the deep sea, whence
he could no longer discern the port;
whereupon the youth began to lament
aloud. O Florence! that sorrowful youth
thus lamenting is before you in this pulpit.
I left my father’s house to find the
harbor of religion, departing when I was
twenty-three years old in pursuit only of
liberty and a life of quiet&mdash;two things I
loved beyond all others. But then I
looked upon the waters of this world,
and began, by preaching, to gain some
courage; and, finding pleasure therein,
the Lord led me upon the sea,
and has carried me far away into the
great deep, where I now am, and can no
longer descry the harbor. <i>Undique sunt
angustiæ-</i>-shoals are on every side. I see
before me the threatening tribulations
and tempests, the harbor of refuge left
behind, the wind carrying me forward
into the great deep. On my right, the
elect calling upon me for help; on my
left, demons and the wicked tormenting
and raging. Over, above me, I see everlasting
goodness, and hope encourages
me thitherward; hell I see beneath me,
which, from human frailty, I must dread,
and into which, without the help of God,
I must inevitably fall. O Lord, Lord!
whither hast thou led me? That I might
save some souls to thee, I am myself so
placed that I can no more return to the
quiet I left. Why hast thou created me
to live among the contentions and discords
of the earth? I once was free, and
now I am the slave of every one. I see
war and discord coming upon me from
every side. But do you, O my friends!
you the elect of God, have pity upon me.
Give me flowers; for, as is said in the
Canticle, <i>quia amore langueo</i>&mdash;because I
languish through love. Flowers are good
works, and I wish for nothing more than
that you should do that which is acceptable
to God, and save your own souls.”</p>

<p class="p1">Here his agitation was so great
that he was obliged to pause, saying:
“Now let me have some rest in this
tempest.” Then resuming his discourse:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“But what, what, O Lord! will be the
reward in the life to come to be given to
those who have come victorious out of
such a fight? It will be that which eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard&mdash;eternal
beatitude. And what is to be the reward
in the present life? The servant will not
be greater than his master, is the answer
of our Lord. Thou knowest that, after I
had taught, I was crucified, and thus
thou wilt suffer martyrdom. O Lord,
Lord!” he then exclaimed, with a loud
voice that echoed throughout the church,
“grant me this martyrdom, and let me
die quickly for thy sake, as thou diedst for
me. Already I see the axe sharpened.
But the Lord says to me: Wait yet awhile,
until that be finished which is to come to
pass, and then thou shalt show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
strength of mind which will be given
unto thee.”</p>

<p class="pc1">HIS VISIONS AND PROPHECIES.</p>

<p class="p1">He then resumed the explanation
of a psalm at the verse <i>Laudate
Dominum quia bonus</i>, and declaimed
in a burst of ecstatic excitement,
which carried his hearers along with
him, sobbing and weeping. It was
by passages like these, in which the
magnetic attraction of the speaker’s
features, voice, and gestures predominated,
that his hearers were
most affected. And this readily explains
the fact that, when we read
his sermons as reported by those
present, it is difficult to invest the
words with the tremendous effects
they seem to have produced. This
state of ecstasy which seized him in
the pulpit frequently followed him to
his solitary cell, where, for days and
nights together, he would remain the
sleepless victim of visions, until sleep
happily released him. From his
youthful days, he had made himself
familiar with all that S. Thomas
Aquinas says of angels and prophets
and of their visions, and, in like
manner, with all the dreams and visions
of the prophets and patriarchs
as related in the Old Testament.
All these filled his mind, and at
night reproduced themselves with
the vividness of original revelations.
They increased upon him as he read
the Bible and the Fathers more assiduously,
and he accepted them as
divine inspirations sent through the
intervention of angels. It is difficult
to believe the extent to which a
blind faith and devotion to these visions
had taken possession of all his
faculties, when we look at the calm,
decided, and practical manner in
which he disposed of important questions
of a merely mundane character,
such as administration, finance, and
civil government.</p>

<p>Savonarola has left on record the
fullest account of the workings and
condition of his own mind on the
subject of his visions and prophecies,
in two works&mdash;<i>Dialogo della Verita
Profetica</i> (Dialogue on Prophetic
Truth), and <i>Compendium Revelationum</i>.</p>

<p class="pc1">WAS SAVONAROLA A PROTESTANT?</p>

<p class="p1">In these works, Savonarola reveals
himself without reserve on the important
subject of the prophecies and
visions, and lays bare his inmost
heart. This is a part of his biography
we would gladly treat at length,
for the reason that one of the accusations
against him is that of insincerity,
bad faith, and deception of
the people by abusing their credulity.
We must, however, content ourselves
with the remark that, although
these works may afford some proof
of an overheated imagination and
an overexcited mind, they certainly
afford none whatever of any thought
or impulse of their author not perfectly
sincere and loyal. His two
German Protestant biographers, Rudelbach
and Meyer, to their honor
be it said, were the first to study
these prophetic writings of Savonarola.
Their views diverge but
slightly, both seeking to show that
he was a Protestant&mdash;a question now
scarcely worth while discussing, notwithstanding
the impertinent assertion
of the Luther monument at
Worms. In this connection, we
may here cite the opinion of a late
writer on Savonarola, a distinguished
English Protestant:<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> “So
that the effort made by some of the
German biographers, more especially
Meyer, who artistically concocts a
complete system of Protestant dogmatics
from his works, appears to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
injudicious; and we must come to
the only reasonable conclusion: that,
though he (Savonarola) is now
claimed both by Catholics and Protestants,
he lived and died in that
church in which he was reared, and
which he would not have destroyed,
but purified.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p class="pc1">PARTIES AND FACTIONS.</p>

<p class="p1">When we speak of the respect and
veneration entertained for Savonarola
by the population of Florence, we
must not for a moment suppose he
was any exception to the rule that
the presence of a good man is a
reproach to the depraved, or that
Florence, like Athens, had not within
her walls those who were tired of
hearing a man called just. The
Medici had still a large body of
adherents in the city&mdash;men who,
whether they preferred or not an
oligarchy to a republic, still regretted
the offices or emoluments they had
lost&mdash;were themselves of the aristocracy,
or sympathized with it. Then
came many of the amnestied, who,
themselves pardoned, did not therefore
forgive others. Then, too, those
who felt themselves thwarted in their
license or licentiousness by the changed
state of public morality. The dominant
party&mdash;that of the Frate&mdash;went
by the name of the <i>Frateschi</i>. A
smaller party, composed of those
who were not personally his adherents,
but were in favor of a republic,
were called <i>Bianchi</i> (white); another
and larger party, made up of partisans
of the Medici, most of them amnestied,
were called <i>Bigi</i> (grays), and,
while outwardly favorable to Savonarola,
were his bitter and unrelenting
enemies, in constant correspondence
with Piero de’ Medici, whose return
was the object of all their devices
and plots. The partisans of the
oligarchy, so active in their endeavors
to defeat the new government, and
bent on getting the power into their
own hands, and establish a pretended
republic under aristocratic rule, were
naturally opposed to both Savonarola
and the Medici. They had contemptuously
bestowed the name of
<i>Piagnoni</i> (Mourners) on the followers
of Savonarola, and, from their
known bitter hatred, were themselves
called the <i>Arrabiati</i> (rabid or infuriated).
Carefully avoiding any opposition
to the republic, they sought by
every means to cast discredit on Savonarola,
to throw ridicule upon his
visions and prophecies, to create discontent
with his reforms, and to foster
a spirit of criticism and dislike
against him. The accidental elevation
to the office of Gonfaloniere of a
man unfit for it&mdash;Filippo Corbizzi&mdash;was
seized by them as an opportunity
to attack Savonarola as early as
1495. At their instigation, he called
together at the Palazzo a sort of theological
council of theologians, abbots,
priors, etc., before whom a
charge of intermeddling in the affairs
of state was laid against Savonarola.
The council was opened, and the discussion
commenced, when, by the
merest accident, Savonarola, in entire
ignorance of what was taking place,
entered the hall with his friend Fra
Domenico, of Pescia. He was instantly
assailed with words of abuse
and invective, and a Dominican
monk of Santa Maria Novella, who
had some reputation as a theologian,
made a violent speech against him.
Others followed the monk, and, when
all were through, Savonarola, calmly
rising, said: “In me you see verified
the saying of our Lord: <i>Filii matris
meæ pugnaverunt contra me.</i><a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
truly grieves me to see my fiercest
adversary wearing the dress of S.
Dominic. That very dress ought to
remind him that our founder himself
was in no small degree occupied with
the affairs of this world; and that
from our order have gone forth a
multitude of religious men and saints
to take part in the affairs of state.
The Florentine republic cannot have
forgotten Cardinal Latino, San Pietro
Martine, Santa Caterina of Sienna,
nor Sant’ Antonino, all of whom
belong to the Order of S. Dominic.
A religious man is not to be condemned
for occupying himself with
the concerns of that world in which
God has placed him. I defy any one
to point out a single passage in the
Bible condemnatory of our showing
favor to a free government which is
to promote the triumph of morality
and religion.” And he thus concluded:
“It is easy to see that religion
ought not to be treated in profane
places, and that theology is not
a fit subject for discussion in this
place.”</p>

<p>There was no attempt at reply,
except from one, who cried out:
“Tell us now frankly, Do you aver
that your words come from God, or
do you not?”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p class="pc1">ALBERT’S VISIT.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Fanny</span>, after despatching her letter,
was filled with an uneasiness that
was continually increasing. “Will
he get here in season?” she asked
herself. “Perhaps mademoiselle will
have come to a decision before
Albert arrives.”</p>

<p>But however partial Fanny might
be to her protégé, she could not
help seeing that Louis possessed rare
qualities. If her interests had not
been at stake, she would have confessed
at once that he alone was
worthy of Mlle. Smithson; but her
selfishness kept her wilfully blind.</p>

<p>Alas! day after day passed away
without result. The wonderful letter
Fanny depended so much on produced
no effect. Twenty times a
day she went from despair into
anger.</p>

<p>“Such a fine dowry!” she would
exclaim. “Such a pretty girl! And
he allowing them to slip through his
fingers&mdash;to fall into the hands of
another&mdash;and what other!... A
spendthrift who will squander her
property&mdash;a libertine who will neglect
his wife!... Ah! she might
be so happy with him, and he with
her! And I should be so sure of an
easy life in their house! What is he
doing?... Is he absorbed in
trifles, and going to lose such an
opportunity? I was right: he is
light-headed. But his mother, Mme.
Frémin, has sense enough, I am
sure, and has longed for this match
these ten years: is she asleep too?
Or has she changed her mind?...”</p>

<p>When the day of the dinner came,
of which I have just spoken, Fanny’s
distress was unbounded. “The enemy
is constantly gaining ground,”
she muttered to herself. “Every
day Mlle. Eugénie becomes less indifferent
towards him. Perhaps they
will come to an understanding to-night,
and vow to love each other.
We are lost! Albert is positively a
simpleton!”</p>

<p>When Eugénie retired to her
chamber, Fanny, quivering with excitement,
was there to eye her narrowly,
hoping to read the depths of
her soul. She saw her mistress was
more thoughtful than usual, and
began by artfully praising Louis.
Eugénie seemed to listen with pleasure.
All this caused the wily servant
a sleepless night.... When daylight
appeared, Fanny had decided on her
course. This <i>soubrette</i> was a long-headed
woman!</p>

<p>“If I had to choose a husband for
Mlle. Eugénie,” she said to herself,
“I certainly should not select M.
Louis. Mademoiselle would be far
happier with Albert. As to him, he
will never find another equal to her.
But I cannot force them to be happy.
It is their own affair. Mine is to
look out for my own interests....
What do I want?... To secure a
pleasant home for the rest of my life.
Perhaps this new suitor would give
me one.... Is he really as much
of a spendthrift, and as overbearing,
as I feared at first? I have seen
him only a few times, but I know
him well enough to see I may have
been greatly deceived, and that there
is much more in him than I supposed....
Well, that is settled: if Albert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
is not here in season, if I see the
other one is likely to win the day, I
shall take sides with him.... But I
will make one more sacrifice for the
ungrateful fellow whom I have loved
so much! I will write his mother
again, and wait a few days longer....”</p>

<p>She wrote, and did not have long
to wait. Albert arrived the next
day but one. When he appeared,
Fanny almost sank to the ground
with astonishment and joy: with
joy, because she loved him as spinsters
always love when they love at
all&mdash;with as much strength as selfishness;
with astonishment, for she
hardly recognized him. She had not
seen him for a year and a half. He
was then in the third year of his law
studies&mdash;a young man of sprightly,
jovial air, faultless in dress, and fluent
of speech, though he only talked
of trifles.... <i>Quantum mutatus!</i> ...
He now had a grave air, his dress
was plain even to severity, and there
was a solemnity in his manner of
speaking that confounded Fanny,
but which pleased her. What had
wrought such a change? She was
dying to know, but had to wait to
be enlightened on the point till she
could see him in private. This could
not take place at once. He must
renew his acquaintance with his
uncle, aunt, and cousin.</p>

<p>Albert’s sudden arrival caused
some surprise, but not very much,
however, for he had promised several
months before to come about this
time. Mr. Smithson received him
with his usual quiet, somewhat cool
regard. He looked upon his nephew
as frivolous, and for such people he
had no liking. But Mme. Smithson
gave her dear Albert a very different
reception. She loved him for his
own sake, and especially for his
mother’s, whom she regarded with
affection and pity. She was quite
well aware that her sister’s income
was very limited, and to see Albert
marry her daughter would by no
means have been repugnant to her.
Eugénie also received her cousin
with the pleasure and cordiality natural
to a relative meeting the friend
of her childhood.</p>

<p>In the course of two hours, he was
made to feel quite at home, at liberty
to go where he pleased, and to do
what he liked. All the family had
some employment, Eugénie as well
as her parents. Albert at once profited
by this liberty to <i>prendre langue</i>,
as the saying is&mdash;to get the news from
Fanny. For had she not induced
him to come here, and made him
aware of her projects?...
He found her in a small building
not far from the house. It was on
the banks of the river, which was
more charming here than in any
other part. Its peaceful current glided
between high banks where grew
on either hand a row of willows
whose pendant branches swept the
very waters. Everything was delightfully
quiet and romantic. It
was Eugénie’s favorite retreat, where
she often came in the morning to
read, or to muse as the day declined.
But Albert gave no heed to the
beauties of nature around him.</p>

<p>“At last we can have a talk, my
good Fanny,” said he: “talk of our
mutual plans, eh! eh!&mdash;for it seems
you, too, wish me to marry Eugénie.
Our plans are in danger, if I am to
believe your two letters: it is possible
I may be set aside! That would
be a pity! My cousin is handsomer
than ever.... But to tell the truth,
her style of beauty is not exactly to
my taste: she is too dignified.
But ...”</p>

<p>“Too dignified!... Mademoiselle
is enchanting; and then, there
is her fortune, which it is no harm to
consider.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span></p>

<p>“My uncle’s losses have made a
hole in it, however.”</p>

<p>“But they are being repaired
every day by his industry. You
would not believe how profitable
this mill is. Come, tell me plainly,
will you ever find a wife as rich?&mdash;with
even half as much as she will
have?...”</p>

<p>“<i>Ma foi!</i> no.”</p>

<p>“And the money you would never
find again you have come near letting
slip into another’s hands!...
There is some danger of it still.”</p>

<p>“You alarm me.”</p>

<p>“It is just so. Why were you so
long in coming?”</p>

<p>“Because ... <i>Tiens</i>, my dear, I
was just going to tell you a fib, but
it would do no good. I may as well
show my hand.... I came very reluctantly,
because I prefer my bachelor
life. It would suit me better to
wait a while. Would it be dangerous
to ask a delay of two or four
years?”</p>

<p>“Ah! it is not enough to furnish
you with a handsome wife and a fine
fortune! One must wait till you are
disposed to accept them! Where
are your wits?”</p>

<p>“Come, do not get angry. I see
I must marry her at once. I will do
as you say. Here, I am all ready to
listen to your advice, for you must
tell me what I am to do.”</p>

<p>“You give in? You may as
well! Come, own that you gave me
a false impression. And I was so
pleased! Your grave air and plain
dress made me hope you were converted&mdash;I
see I was mistaken, and
am sorry for it.”</p>

<p>“A fine farce. And so I even took
you in! But did you not tell me to
come here like a man seriously disposed?
If I succeeded in deceiving
you, the disguise must be perfect.
The rest are more easily taken in
than you!... But that is not the
point. You look quite frightened.
What are you afraid of?”</p>

<p>“Everything, and principally lest
you make Mlle. Eugénie unhappy.”</p>

<p>“She shall be mistress: that is
what she likes&mdash;what else?”</p>

<p>“When you are married, you will
no longer have any need of me, and
will send me away.”</p>

<p>“Send you away! I am ready to
swear.... Here, I will give you my
promise in writing: you shall never
leave my house. Fanny, do you
think me capable of such ingratitude?
I am frivolous, but I have some
heart, you well know, you old grumbler....
Well, how do affairs really
stand?... Does not your affection
for me incline you to take too gloomy
a view of things?... My enemy&mdash;my
rival, if I rightly understand
your letters&mdash;is a fellow who ruined
himself, and came here to win the
beautiful Eugénie’s heart and fortune;
he is very sedate in appearance,
and artful in reality. But it is
not enough to be ruined, and long
for a fortune&mdash;the thing is to get it.
The first condition is to please the
lady. Is he a handsome fellow?”</p>

<p>“No; but he has a sensible, refined
face calculated to strike the fancy of
a young lady like your cousin.”</p>

<p>“Has he much wit?”</p>

<p>“He talks little, but well.”</p>

<p>“He is religious, I think you
said?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he has founded a library
and a school for the benefit of the
workmen, and he visits the poor.
All this affords him many opportunities
of meeting Mlle. Eugénie. She
gives him books for his library, paper
and pens for his school, and they
agree upon the families to visit.”</p>

<p>“Ha! he is a knowing fellow. He
thinks that a good way to please my
cousin and to see her. Then Eugénie
is more religious than she used
to be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span></p>

<p>“It seems so, but you know it is
not easy to tell what is going on in
mademoiselle’s heart.”</p>

<p>“Fanny, you have rendered me a
service I shall never forget. It was
time to come&mdash;high time. I am
even afraid I am too late. Have
you detected anything to make you
think her in love with him already?”</p>

<p>“She began by regarding him with
aversion. This softened into indifference.
What further change there
is I do not know.”</p>

<p>“What caused her aversion?”</p>

<p>“She thought he came here to
catch her.”</p>

<p>“The deuce!”</p>

<p>“His piety seemed to her mere
artifice.”</p>

<p>“Evidently!... Is any one ever
converted without a motive?”</p>

<p>“You are a wicked creature, Albert.
Louis may be a hypocrite,
but all religious people are not hypocrites.
I even begin to think he is
not.”</p>

<p>“Come, go on!... Well, I see
Eugénie regards him as a saint. She
admires him, if nothing more. The
danger is imminent.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?
Nothing wrong, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Be easy on that score. I am
going to keep an eye on that man,
and study him. If he is sincere, I
will make him ridiculous; if he is
false, I will unmask him. Of course,
I shall also employ other means. If
Eugénie is not yet in love with him,
I shall be the foremost to win her
heart. If she is attached to him, I
shall do my utmost to appear more
worthy of her regard, and to rout
him. It is unnecessary to say I shall
persist in my <i>rôle</i> as a person of
gravity. Eugénie is absurdly romantic.
I must endeavor to appear
more saintly than this new apostle.
No one will suspect the farce. It is
an age since I was here, and it would
not be astonishing if I also had been
converted during the interval.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far!”</p>

<p>“You may rely on that. There is
only one thing I am anxious about.
Have I not some invisible obstacle to
contend against?... Eugénie has a
will of her own. If she has already
made up her mind, if her heart is set
on him, all my attempts would be of
no avail.”</p>

<p>“Things have not come to that
pass yet, I have every reason to believe.
I know where and when she
has seen him, and what he has said
to her. She only regards him with
esteem, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>After deciding on his plans, Albert
had but one wish&mdash;to put them at
once in execution. That very evening
at dinner he directed the conversation
to Louis. Mme. Smithson
heartily praised the engineer. Mr.
Smithson neither praised nor spoke
disparagingly of him. He kept his
suspicions with regard to Louis to
himself. He was not in the habit
of doing anything hastily, but had
fully made up his mind to dismiss
him if he found him as thorough a
Catholic as he had reason to believe;
that is, an overzealous one, secretly
contriving with the <i>curé</i> all sorts of
dark plots, the idea of which alarmed
him.</p>

<p>Eugénie, in a perfectly natural
manner, confirmed all her mother
had said, spoke of the good works
he had undertaken, and finally mentioned
the part she had had in them.</p>

<p>“I also should be delighted to
participate in all these laudable undertakings,”
said Albert. “I must
tell you, dear cousin, that I am beginning
to be reasonable. I take an
interest in studying the great social
problems, especially the extinction
of pauperism, and the moral improvement
of the lower classes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson gave Albert an incredulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
look, and Eugénie broke
out into unrestrained laughter.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Albert, intimidated
and cut to the quick, “you shall
see if what I tell you is not true!
To-morrow I will visit this wonderful
school, and offer my services to the
person who has charge of it. I rather
think they will not be refused.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Eugénie, “how amusing
it will be to see you drilling
under M. Louis’ orders!... You
will soon have enough of it.”</p>

<p>“You think me fickle, then?”</p>

<p>“Rather so.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. I always
like the same things, and especially
the same people, my dear cousin.”</p>

<p>“How gallant you have become,”
said Eugénie, laughing again. “But
what has come over us! We used
to say <i>thou</i> to each other; now we
say <i>you</i>. Once we kept up a succession
of compliments anything but
flattering to each other, and here you
are now gracious, amiable, and complimentary
beyond description! It
is a pity I can make no return....
But it is all in vain, my dear Albert;
neither your white cravat nor your
subdued air can deceive me. My
aunt wrote me not long ago that you
were just the same. Do you hear?&mdash;your
own mother said there was
no change in you.”</p>

<p>This unvarnished statement had
really been made in one of Mme.
Frémin’s letters. She little thought
of injuring her son by showing him
in so true a light.</p>

<p>“My mother was mistaken,” said
Albert, exceedingly vexed at such
annoying remarks; “or rather, you
have given a wrong interpretation to
her words. I am indeed the same
in a certain sense. When there is
cause for laughter, I am ready to
laugh. But though it is proper to
laugh at suitable times, I feel that
excessive and constant gaiety is unworthy
of a man who aspires to a
high place in the estimation of
others.”</p>

<p>“Ah! to think of your sermonizing,
my dear cousin,” cried Eugénie,
looking at him with a mocking air.
“But now I begin to understand
your behavior.... Yes; that is it....
You have an eye to the bench.
You consider gravity as part of a
judge’s outfit. You are right, but
between ourselves, as no one hears
you, confess that the mask is anything
but comfortable.”</p>

<p>Albert was vexed and uneasy.
His attempts were in vain: he could
not persuade Eugénie he was really
what he wished to appear. His sagacious
cousin continued to banter
him with a wit he found it difficult to
ward off.</p>

<p>Eugénie had no special design in
her bantering, but her very simplicity
and wit disarmed Albert, and thwarted
his plans. How far this was from
the <i>belle passion</i> he hoped to inspire!
Eugénie treated him merely like a
cousin, almost like a boy. He resolved
to let her see he was a man&mdash;a
thoughtful and even religious
man. “To-morrow,” thought he,
“I will go and beard the lion in his
den. I will watch him narrowly; I
will become his friend in order to
thwart him. When I have convinced
my uncle and aunt there are
others quite as rational as this gentleman,
without being fanatics like
him&mdash;for he is one, according to Eugénie’s
own account&mdash;when I have
won the admiration of my romantic
cousin, then we will think of wooing.
But we must begin by driving this
Jesuit away. Really, the comedy
begins to interest me. A fine fortune
and a pretty wife are at stake. Moreover,
there is this dismal creature to
cover with confusion. If I do not
come off conqueror, it will be because
the fates are strangely against me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were Albert’s thoughts after
retiring to his chamber. Then he
betook himself to a novel. He
was delighted to find himself so
shrewd, and had no doubt of his success.</p>

<p>At that same hour, Louis was
also awake, but absorbed in prayer.
Piety daily increased in his steadfast
soul: so did love in his heart. Albert’s
arrival, which he was at once
informed of, produced a painful impression.
“Mr. Smithson distrusts
me,” he said to himself; “Eugénie
does not yet love me: it will be easy
for this young man to win the place
I covet in her heart.” He dwelt on
these sad thoughts for some time,
but soon had recourse to his usual
source of consolation, and confided
all his cares to God. The prayer he
uttered might be summed up in these
few words, so full of Christian heroism:
“O my God! if it is in his
power to render her happier than I
could, I pray thee to bestow her on
him, and let me find my only consolation
in thee!...” The true
Christian alone can so purify his affections
as to render them disinterested.
When Louis fell asleep, he
felt a storm was brewing in the air,
but calmness was in his heart. Resignation,
trust in God, and the
purity of his love had restored serenity
to his soul.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p class="pc1">A VILLAIN.</p>

<p class="p1">Albert called at Louis’ office about
ten o’clock the next morning. This
office was in the centre of the manufactory,
between two large rooms
always filled with workmen. Here
Louis was confined ten long hours a
day. If he went out from time to
time, it was first to one place, and
then to another, to keep an eye on
everything, and remedy any slight
accident that might have occurred.
He everywhere replaced Mr. Smithson.
He saw to everything, and
gave orders about everything, and
acquitted himself of these duties with
an ability and zeal that his employer
could not help acknowledging. He
could not have wished for an assistant
more capable, more energetic, or
more reliable. Had it not been for
one suspicion in this cold Protestant’s
breast, one cause of antipathy
against this overzealous Catholic,
Mr. Smithson would not only have
esteemed Louis, but would have taken
him to his heart. As it was, he contented
himself with merely esteeming
him, and this against his will.</p>

<p>The workmen were divided into
two parties with respect to Louis.
The good, who were the least numerous&mdash;alas!
it is so everywhere: the
majority are on the wrong side&mdash;were
absolutely devoted to him.
The bad feared him. They knew he
was inflexible when there was any
question of their morals or the rules
of the establishment. Louis would
not tolerate drunkenness, or blasphemy,
or any improper talk. The
fear he excited among the bad made
him extremely hated by a few.</p>

<p>When Albert entered the engineer’s
office, the latter went forward to
meet him with the ease of a man of
the world receiving a visit, and with
the reserve of a diplomatist who finds
himself in the presence of an adversary.
From the very moment these two
men first saw each other, they felt they
were opponents. Each one had a
position to defend which the other
sought for, and both were conscious
of it. Before the Parisian uttered a
word, Louis divined what was passing
in his heart. “He has come to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
me away and marry his cousin,”
thought he. “If Providence favors
his plans, I shall submit. But it was
God who brought me hither. I do
not think I am mistaken in believing
he has given me a work to do here,
and I shall not leave till I clearly
see I ought to give it up and go
away.”</p>

<p>Albert had to introduce himself.
“I am Mr. Smithson’s nephew,”
said he, “a licentiate of the law, and
an advocate at the Paris bar. My
relatives have for a long time urged
me to visit them, and I have profited
by an interval of leisure to accept
their invitation. I am aware, monsieur,
of the important <i>rôle</i> you fill in
the house, and what a useful man
you are, and am desirous of making
your acquaintance. Besides, I have
need of your services.”</p>

<p>“If I can be of any service whatever
to you, monsieur, I assure you
it will give me great pleasure to
serve you.”</p>

<p>“My charming cousin Eugénie
tells me, monsieur, that you are engaged
in things I am likewise interested
in&mdash;the relief of the poor and
the instruction of the ignorant around
you. Eugénie has even given me to
understand that she is your assistant
in this work.”</p>

<p>Albert kept his eyes fastened on
Louis’ face as he uttered these words.
He thought he would betray his
feelings at such a greeting&mdash;at the
mere name of Eugénie. But Louis’
countenance remained impenetrable
as usual. Albert felt he had before
him either a very indifferent or a
very shrewd man.</p>

<p>“I am glad to learn, monsieur,”
replied Louis, “that you take an interest,
as well as I, in these Christian
labors, which in these times are more
necessary than ever. Poverty and
immorality are making great ravages.
But I should remark that I am a
mere novice in such matters. As
Mlle. Eugénie has been so kind as
to speak of me, she may have told
you how little I have yet accomplished.
And what I have done has
only been through Mr. Smithson’s
constant aid. You wish, monsieur,
to be initiated into my undertakings.
That will be very easy! I will show
you our library, scarcely established,
and our evening-school: that is all.”</p>

<p>“You must also introduce me to
your poor. I am seriously disposed
to make a practical study of
the great questions of charity and
instruction. They are quite the order
of the day. When can I meet
you?...”</p>

<p>“This evening, if you like; the
school begins at seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“And what do you do at this
school?”</p>

<p>“I teach reading and writing to
those who are ignorant of them,
orthography to some, and ciphering
to others. I end by reading something
carefully selected, with occasional
remarks easy to comprehend
and to retain. This affords me a
daily opportunity of giving my audience
useful advice.”</p>

<p>Albert made a slight grimace.
This manner of procedure did not
suit him. He wished for exercises
that afforded a more promising field
for satisfying his vanity. It was well
to propose being useful! He wished
to shine.</p>

<p>They continued to converse a while
longer. Louis, with the shrewdness
that characterized him, led the conversation
to the most serious subjects.
Albert replied without suspecting
the scrutiny he was undergoing.
Faithful to his <i>rôle</i>, he affected to
judge matters with the seriousness of
a man armed with unfaltering convictions.
But this seriousness did not
blind Louis. Without appearing to
observe it, he caught him a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
times in criminal ignorance, and,
what was worse, this ignorance was
accompanied with a conceit that was
ridiculous. At length the two young
men separated. They had formed
an opinion of each other at the first
glance. Louis had seen through
Albert’s mask, and found him a man
of no depth, poorly aping a person
of gravity. Albert felt he had a sagacious
person to deal with. If
Louis was his rival, he was a formidable
one.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that, loving
Eugénie to such a degree, Louis
felt, as an impartial observer would
have done in his place, that it would
be sad to see a woman of so much
worth united to a superficial man.
He could not help feeling that he
himself was more worthy of Eugénie
than Albert; that he was more capable
of making her happy. He was
not mistaken; he had a right to
think so.</p>

<p>A few days after this first interview,
I sent Louis word that Victor was
very much worse. His disease had
made alarming progress. Victor
had hitherto struggled courageously
against it, but, the evening before,
he took me by the hand, and, fixing
his large melancholy eyes on mine,
said:</p>

<p>“My dear, my beloved wife, I have
kept up till now, and continued to
work as usual. But the hour has
come for me to lay aside all earthly
thoughts and cares.... It is time to
collect my thoughts.... Death is
approaching ...”</p>

<p>At these words, I began to weep
and sob. He waited till this natural
explosion of grief was over.</p>

<p>“I can realize your distress, my
good Agnes,” said he. “I, too, feel
how painful it is to leave you. But
we are both Christians. Our religion
is a source of never-failing consolation....
See how good God has
been to us! I might have died months
ago: God has left me with you till
now. He has given me time to prepare
to enter his presence. And I
truly believe that, by the help of his
grace, I have made a good use of
these last days. I have found and
trained a man to succeed me in the
journal. He will defend the good
cause as well as I; perhaps better.
I have saved the life of a young
man who is and always will be a
consistent Christian such as we need
more of. I shall, I hope, have a
share in all the good Louis will accomplish;
and he will do a great
deal.... Of course, my dear Agnes,
it is hard to separate from you, but
we shall meet again on high. The
longest life is but brief. How happy
we shall be to meet again far from
this wretched world, which I should
not regret were it not for leaving you. [P2 added period missing in orig]
Every day it gives less room to God:
the impious and the hypocritical are
fearfully multiplying. This is a sad
age! If the very thought of leaving
those we love were not so painful to
the heart, ah! how sweet it would
be to soar away from so much wickedness
to the pure radiance of heaven.
Why cannot I carry you with me,
my poor darling? Oh! how glad I
should then be to go.... But, no;
it is not the will of God. He wishes
me to precede you, alone. So be it.
When in yonder world, I shall pray
for you!... And now, let us give
up all worldly things to those who
have a longer time to live. As for
me, I must cease to labor, and henceforth
think of nothing but God and
my salvation....”</p>

<p>The following morning, I sent Louis
word of what had taken place. He
hastened to see us that afternoon.
When he saw our dear Victor, he
was exceedingly affected. My husband
had changed every way within
a fortnight, without my being conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
of it, having been constantly
with him.</p>

<p>“Oh! how glad I am to see you!”
said he to Louis. “Well, well, we
shall not meet many times more, ...
here below, I mean, but we shall
meet again in heaven never more to
separate.”</p>

<p>Louis burst into tears.</p>

<p>“You great child!” continued he.
“If it were not for my sweet Agnes
there, I would beg you to congratulate
me: I am going home to God!
But the idea of leaving that dear
soul, who has made me so happy,
hangs like a cloud between me and
heaven. Oh! you will, you will
watch over her as I would myself,
will you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes; as your very self, I solemnly
promise you,” cried Louis. Then,
falling on his knees beside the bed,
he said: “My friend, assure me once
more that you forgive me. It is I
who have killed you!”</p>

<p>Victor drew him towards him, and
embraced him. Louis then begged
my forgiveness also. I could not
answer him, but I held out my hand,
which he respectfully kissed.</p>

<p>“One favor more,” said Louis:
“I hope you will not leave us so
soon as you suppose, but it is better
to make the request now, as I can
do it to-day without troubling you:
give me your blessing!”</p>

<p>Victor excused himself, but Louis
insisted so long that he yielded.
Victor then extended his hand over
his friend’s head: “O my God!”
said he, “I am only a sinner, with
no right to bless in thy name; but I
have given my heart to thee, and I
also love this soul to whom thou has
permitted me to do some good.
Watch over him!... Make
him happy here below, or, if it is thy
will he should suffer, grant him the
necessary courage to find joy in sorrow
itself.”</p>

<p>This scene was deeply affecting.
For some time we remained silent.
Victor, unwilling to leave us so painfully
impressed, began to smile and
say the liveliest things he could imagine.
Addressing Louis, he said:</p>

<p>“How are your love affairs? You
cannot imagine how I long for your
union with a woman so calculated to
make you happy. The more I think
of it, the more I am convinced that
Mlle. Smithson is the very person.”</p>

<p>Louis replied with a sigh. He
related what had taken place at the
great dinner, and the wrong impression
Mr. Smithson had derived from
the <i>curé’s</i> imprudence. He also
told us of Albert’s arrival, and gave
a brief account of their interview.</p>

<p>“This man’s unexpected appearance
has caused me sincere pain,”
he said. “It has excited a thousand
fears only too well grounded. Is it
because I think him capable of destroying
my most cherished hopes?...
No; not if it depends merely
on him. His meaningless face, his
affected and pretentious manners,
and his vacant mind, are not calculated
to fascinate Mlle. Eugénie.
Her nature is entirely different from
his. His defects must shock her.
But the man, from what I am told,
has the luck of being in his aunt’s
good graces. Who knows but Mme.
Smithson herself induced him to
come, with the positive intention of
giving him her daughter’s hand in
marriage?...”</p>

<p>“It is possible,” said Victor, “but
you have one good cause for hope
in spite of everything. You acknowledge
yourself that such a man
cannot please Mlle. Eugénie. Now,
she is a woman with a mind of her
own, and her parents are very indulgent
to her. These two reasons induce
me to believe she will never
marry him.”</p>

<p>“She is different from most women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>”
replied Louis. “Her filial devotion
may lead her to accept the
husband her parents propose....
Ah! if she loved me, I should not
be alarmed on that score. For an
instant, I thought she did; but the
longer I study things calmly, the
more inclined I am to believe I was
lulled by a sweet illusion.... She
does not love me yet. It is possible
she might, had things remained as
they were. Everything will take a
new turn now. This young relative’s
arrival will absorb her attention, and
how do I know but she will even
end by taking him for what he pretends
to be&mdash;a grave, thoughtful
man?”</p>

<p>“I have no fears on that point,”
said Victor. “If this intruder is the
superficial person you suppose&mdash;and
he is, I believe&mdash;he will not deceive
a person so observing as Mlle.
Smithson.”</p>

<p>“He is her cousin.... Every
one in the house treats him with
great affection.... Mlle. Eugénie
is young and without experience, ...
and the man in question does not
lack a certain ability.... He has
already annoyed me in more than
one way.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible! How?”</p>

<p>“I told you that at our first interview
he immediately expressed a
wish to aid me in the work I had
undertaken. I promised to introduce
him to my school that evening.
He was so urgent that he excited
my suspicions at once. My fears
were only too well founded, as you
will see. I had scarcely been a
quarter of an hour in the schoolroom,
before he came in with Mr.
Smithson. I am anxious not to exaggerate
anything; above all, I do
not wish to calumniate him. It is,
therefore, with all sincerity I tell you
that this designing man, at his first
visit, so arranged everything as to
take the precedence of me before my
scholars. With his arm passed familiarly
through his uncle’s, he entered
with a mere salutation of condescending
patronage. Then, after
going to the door with Mr. Smithson,
who had business elsewhere, he remained
as if to superintend and direct
me, as the master of the house
might have done, had he wished to
assert his rights. I repeat it: this fellow
only came there to make the
workmen feel that he was, even in
my night-school, if not the master,
at least his representative, and I the
humble agent. In fact, without consulting
me, he began to give advice
to one and another, making a great
deal of noise, and meddling with
everything, so that, thanks to him,
nothing was done. He disturbed
everybody, and was of no assistance.</p>

<p>“Of course, the idle and talkative,
as well as those disposed to flattery,
took to the new-comer. As to me,
I frankly confess he had a singular
effect on my nerves. However, I restrained
myself, and said nothing to
him that evening. The next morning,
he called on me, and announced
his intention of beginning a series of
lessons on political economy. As
you know, I am in the habit of reading
aloud every evening from some
good book&mdash;a historical incident, an
anecdote, or a moral extract calculated
to interest the workmen. To
this I join some familiar explanations
and reflections of a moral and even
religious nature. This exercise, as
simple as it is beneficial in its results,
was not to his liking. He wished to
replace it advantageously, as he said,
by instructions apparently learned,
but in reality useless and even pernicious.
Nothing is worse than to
waste great words on people absolutely
destitute of elementary knowledge.
But the very ignorance of
his audience attracted Albert. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
thought he should dazzle them without
much effort, and without running
the risk of their finding out how little
he really knows. I listened very
coldly to his proposal. When he
left, he gave me a slight glance of
spitefulness which was ominous of
evil.</p>

<p>“That night the young man did not
appear in the schoolroom, but the
following evening he presented himself.
This time he made so much
confusion that I could not conceal
my annoyance. He perceived it, and
left the room. I regretted not having,
perhaps, restrained my feelings
sufficiently. I followed him into the
next room. He received me with
insolent haughtiness, and took my
explanations unkindly. When I had
finished, he thus addressed me:</p>

<p>“‘Monsieur, there are some who
do good out of love of being useful:
to such I belong. There are others
who do it from motives of self-love
and interest: you may know of some....
You have instituted this school;
you direct it in your own way; you
wish to be the sole master. What
your reason is for all this I do not
know, but I can certify one thing:
you wish to have your workmen to
yourself. It is not my practice to
intrude anywhere, even when I have
a perfect right. Consequently I
withdraw.’</p>

<p>“I stopped him to ask what motive
of interest I could have.</p>

<p>“‘O monsieur!’ said he, ‘the
name of a philanthropist is not to be
despised. It leads to many things.
You know better than I what use you
wish to make of it; it is not for me to
tell you. It remains to be seen if
you succeed.’</p>

<p>“He evidently wished to insinuate
that I had taken this indirect way
of gaining the esteem of the Smithson
family, and perhaps Eugénie’s
affections. I felt my anger rise. I
was about to reply in a way I should
have regretted, but he prevented it
by going out without giving me an
opportunity.</p>

<p>“At first, I congratulated myself on
my victory. I am ashamed to say
that my pride, which I thought I
had conquered, again reappeared in
my heart. ‘He is afraid of me!’ I
said to myself. ‘He feels my superiority,
and has gone away through
mortification.’ Subsequent reflection
convinced me of my mistake.
Albert, in withdrawing, was not vanquished,
but really the conqueror.
He had successfully achieved his
perfidious design. He was tired of
the school, and felt he should soon
cut a sorry figure in it. He sought
the means of getting out of it, which
I unwittingly furnished him, so that
his very retreat could be used as a
plea against me. All my subsequent
observations have confirmed my suspicions.
I have not met him since,
but I can see he has been secretly
plotting against me. Mr. Smithson
is colder than ever towards me. As
to Mlle. Eugénie, I have met her
only once, walking with Albert. She
saw me, and might have spoken, but
pretended not to observe me.... Ah!
my dear friend, I am, I confess,
down-hearted. For days, I have seen
that my course and my principles
excite Mr. Smithson’s suspicions, but
I had some reason to believe I was
no longer indifferent to his daughter.
Now she herself has turned, or rather,
has been turned, against me. In
a month, she will no longer be able
to endure me.... What shall I
do?”</p>

<p>“Keep straight on: continue the
work you have begun. If an opportunity
occurs for explanation either
with the father or daughter, convince
them that you are an honest man.”</p>

<p>Our poor friend was very gloomy
when he left us. We participated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
in his sadness, for we did not doubt
but this cousin, who had come so
inopportunely, was slyly doing him
some ill-turn. We were not wrong
in thinking so. I will relate what
had taken place.</p>

<p>As Louis rightly conjectured, Albert
had willingly allowed himself
to be excluded from the school. He
immediately presented himself in the
<i>salon</i> with an air of discouragement,
but triumphing in the bottom of his
heart.</p>

<p>“You have returned early this
evening,” said Eugénie. “Are you
tired of the school already?”</p>

<p>“I am not tired of it, but they can
no longer endure me there.”</p>

<p>“Have you made yourself insupportable?”
asked Eugénie. She
really did not love her cousin, and
under the appearance of teasing him,
as is the way with young people, she
told him some pretty plain truths as
often as she could. Mr. Smithson
was reading a newspaper. Hearing
what Eugénie and Albert said, he
looked up, and said to his nephew, in
his usual grave tone:</p>

<p>“What has happened?”</p>

<p>“I have been dismissed from the
school.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said Eugénie.</p>

<p>Albert was astonished at the persistency
with which his cousin defended
Louis. He felt his hatred
redouble against the engineer.</p>

<p>“You may well think it impossible,”
said he, in an insinuating tone....
“Really, if this gentleman
has a right to figure in the school he
has founded with my uncle’s aid, I,
his nephew, and almost a child of the
house, have a right to take a part in
it also. But such is not the opinion
of our imperious co-laborer. There
is a certain routine about his instructions
that I mildly criticised. For
example, he tries, however awkward
it may be, to give a religious turn to
everything, which I, though a great
friend to religion, find ridiculous.”</p>

<p>In this underhand way, Albert
skilfully aroused his uncle’s anger
and distrust. Mr. Smithson murmured
to himself, with that voice of
the soul inaudible to others: “I
thought so: he is fanatical and ambitious.
My nephew, fool as he is,
has found it out, and has unmasked
him! That is why the other has got
rid of him.”</p>

<p>Albert partly guessed what was
passing in his uncle’s mind, and saw
he had made a good hit. He ended
his recriminations in these terms:
“The little advice of a humble nature
I gave him; my course so different
from his, and, I may say without
vanity, better....”</p>

<p>Here Eugénie burst into a loud
laugh.</p>

<p>“Eugénie,” said Mr. Smithson
gravely, “what your cousin is saying
merits attention. You are far too
giddy this evening.”</p>

<p>Eugénie never resisted her father,
except in a case of absolute necessity;
she became silent, and appeared
to take no further interest in the conversation.</p>

<p>“At last,” said Albert, “I clearly
saw this gentleman wished to have
his school to himself, so much at
home does he feel even there....
He rudely ... made me feel that
... I was in the way. I withdrew,
but not without letting him
know, in my turn, that I regarded
his course as it merited.”</p>

<p>“There was no quarrel between
you?” inquired Mr. Smithson, who
had a horror of contention.</p>

<p>“No, uncle.”</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson thereupon proceeded
to console her nephew as
well as she could. The remainder
of the evening passed in an uncomfortable
manner. Each of the four
persons in the room was absorbed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
serious reflection without wishing it
to be obvious, and all felt that they
would not like to communicate what
was passing in their hearts. This
caused a want of ease which became
more and more awkward as it grew
more perceptible in spite of the efforts
each made to conceal it. The two
who were the most troubled, however,
were Mme. Smithson and Albert.
The latter no longer doubted Eugénie’s
love for the engineer. He
ought to have seen that, as usual, she
merely took the side of the oppressed.</p>

<p>As to Mr. Smithson, it was quite
different. A few days previous, he
merely suspected Louis might be
fanatical and ambitious, and linked
with the <i>curé</i> to undermine his authority
among the workmen. Now
he began to be sure of it. He
even went so far as to suspect his
daughter of favoring Louis’ designs.
This Catholic league, established
in his own house and at his
own hearth, filled him with a terror
and anger as lively as they were
ridiculous.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p class="pc1">CALUMNY.</p>

<p class="p1">The next morning, before any one
was up, Albert went in search of
Fanny, with whom he had the following
conversation:</p>

<p>“You have caused me a useless
journey,” said he. “Eugénie loves
the engineer.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it,” replied the
servant, either because she did not,
or because she wished to console
Albert.</p>

<p>“It is of no use to contradict me.
I have kept my eyes open, and drawn
my own conclusions. I have a better
opportunity than you for observation.
I tell you she loves him!
If you cannot devise some scheme
for driving him from her mind, I
shall set out to-morrow for the capital.”</p>

<p>“Here is what I call hitting the
nail on the head.... I thought of
something yesterday exactly to the
point.”</p>

<p>It was Albert’s turn to be incredulous.
He shrugged his shoulders as
a sign of doubt.</p>

<p>“I tell you I can satisfy your
demand,” repeated Fanny slowly.
“Listen! In a manufactory, everything
is talked about. The engineer
has for some time frequented a house
apparently through charity, but it is
my opinion another motive takes
him there. There is a young girl in
the house&mdash;the prettiest, handsomest
girl to be seen, they say, for ten
leagues around. Besides, she is
well behaved, intelligent, and even
pious; only, she is pitifully poor.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how he became acquainted
with the family.”</p>

<p>“The father is a drunkard; the
mother an idle, malicious creature
who is employed here. The engineer
looks after her. This woman
was probably the cause of his going
to the house. They are extremely
destitute.”</p>

<p>“And the girl: what does she
do?”</p>

<p>“She has been very well brought
up at an aunt’s in town. The aunt
died recently, and so suddenly that
she was unable to make her will, as
she intended, in favor of her niece.
The latter has therefore returned
home, to find nothing but wretchedness.
I must confess, however, that
she has behaved admirably....
All these details are correct, I assure
you.... What is no less true,
Mlle. Eugénie knows all the poor
families that the engineer visits except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
this one. It is my conviction that
he loves this girl, and intends marrying
her some day.... There is no
need of making people out worse
than they are. There are some good
things in this M. Louis. All his
family are very wealthy. He will
not be poor long, and is at liberty to
marry a woman who has nothing, if
he pleases.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Albert, “I will reflect
on what you have told me.
It seems to me, with this information,
I can greatly modify my fair cousin’s
feelings towards her protégé.”</p>

<p>Before another hour, Albert had
gathered full particulars with regard
to the subject, and matured his plans.
That very afternoon, he asked Eugénie
to allow him to accompany her
in her rounds among the poor.</p>

<p>“Willingly,” said she. “I have not
been to see them for some time. I was
just thinking I ought to go to-day.”</p>

<p>They set out together. The day
was delightful. Eugénie, lively and
witty as usual, took most of the conversation
upon herself. Albert had
on a dignified air of offence which
he wished his cousin to perceive;
but she did not notice it, or pretended
not. Twenty times he was on
the point of alluding to what had
taken place the evening before, and
as often refrained. Conceited as he
was, Albert could not help it&mdash;he
was not at his ease in Eugénie’s society.
Her unvarying frankness, her
intelligence, and the vivacity that
never forsook her, all these rare
qualities rendered him continually
diffident in her presence.</p>

<p>At some distance from the manufactory,
the road divided. One part
turned towards the highway that led
to the village; the other followed a
gentle declivity to the river half hidden
among the willows, rushes, and
flowers that make that part of the
bank so delightful.</p>

<p>“What a charming view!” said
Albert. “Let us go down this way
a short distance. We can afterwards
return to the highway.”</p>

<p>Eugénie allowed herself to be
guided by his wish. When within a
hundred steps from the shore, they
came to a hut by the wayside, between
two large trees, picturesque
in appearance, but indicative of poverty.
It looked like a forsaken nest
in a thicket.</p>

<p>Albert had made particular inquiries,
and knew the hut was inhabited
by the Vinceneau family&mdash;the one, it
will be recollected, that Louis took
charge of unknown to Eugénie.</p>

<p>“Are there not some of your poor
people here whom you ought to
visit?” asked Albert, in the most innocent
manner.</p>

<p>“No; I have no idea who lives
in this cottage.”</p>

<p>“I saw M. Louis coming out of
it the other day.”</p>

<p>“He probably came here on business.
I know all the families he
visits; none of them lives here.”</p>

<p>While thus talking, Albert approached
the hut, and, before Eugénie
could prevent him, entered.
She followed.</p>

<p>Mère Vinceneau was at home that
day, in one of her fits of idleness and
ill-humor. She at once recognized
Eugénie, whom she did not like.
She had, as I have already remarked,
a general antipathy against the
rich.</p>

<p>“What have you come here for?”
said she.</p>

<p>“We do not wish to disturb you
in the least,” said Eugénie, whose
curiosity was now roused. “My
cousin and I merely wish to rest ourselves.
Perhaps you could give us
some milk.”</p>

<p>“I have none.”</p>

<p>Mère Vinceneau was a tall, spare
woman, with a forbidding countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
and covered with rags. Had
it not been for her crabbed face, she
would certainly have excited compassion.
However, Eugénie’s sympathies
were awakened at the sight
of her wretched condition.</p>

<p>“You seem very destitute, my
good woman,” said she. “Can I
be of any service to you?”</p>

<p>La Vinceneau softened a little at
this gracious offer. “Thank you,”
she said. “It is true we are badly
off, while some people have too
much.... Nevertheless, I ought not
to complain. We have one friend.... You
know him well&mdash;M. Louis,
the engineer of your mill. What a
kind heart he has! There is one
who loves the poor! If the rich
only resembled him!...”</p>

<p>“Do you live here alone?”</p>

<p>“No; I have a husband employed
at the tile-works, and a daughter
who goes out as a seamstress in the
village. She is coming now.”</p>

<p>A slight cloud came over Eugénie’s
face. It became still darker
when Madeleine Vinceneau entered.
Madeleine was not merely beautiful:
she was dazzling. Poorly but neatly
clad, she came forward with a
dignity and grace that inspired astonishment
as well as respect. Her
large black eyes, her pale, refined
face, her smiling lips, and her whole
appearance, had an air of aristocratic
distinction.</p>

<p>“What a lovely creature!” was
Eugénie’s first thought. Then another
presented itself: “Perhaps
Louis loves her.” She shuddered.
A feeling of displeasure and sadness
came over her: “I must be in love
with him myself without being aware
of it, to be so jealous,” she said to
herself. This doubt was natural.
Eugénie determined to solve it.
Such is our nature. We can never
see so clearly what is passing in the
depths of our hearts as in a tempest.</p>

<p>Eugénie began to question the
girl discreetly. She wished to ascertain
if her nature was as angelic as
her exterior. She was soon satisfied
on this point. Madeleine was
innocence itself, and as good as she
was innocent. She confirmed all
her mother had said, and in her
turn praised Louis with an ingenuousness
that assured Eugénie she did
not love him. “But he&mdash;is he as
indifferent to her?...” was Eugénie’s
thought as she left the house.
She could not get rid of the painful
suspicion, consequently she was in
rather a gloomy mood. Albert noticed
it, but refrained from saying
anything. One unguarded word
would have counteracted the happy
effect of his perfidious scheme. But
he was triumphant when he returned
to his room. “I have dealt my
rival a severe blow,” said he to himself&mdash;“a
blow he can hardly recover
from; for he will not suspect its
source, and Eugénie will never mention
it to him. Even if she wished
to, how could they have any explanation?
They never meet except in
the presence of others. Before such
an explanation takes place, I must
find other means of completing his
ruin.... I have begun well, and
must bring things to a crisis....”</p>

<p>All this occurred the day before
Louis came to see us. Mère Vinceneau
told him of the visit a short
time after. He suspected there was
some scheme of Albert’s at the bottom
of it, and dwelt on the means he
should use to defeat his calculations.
Meanwhile, his enemy was contriving
a new plot destined to cause him
still greater embarrassment.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">FROM THE REVUE DU MONDE CATHOLIQUE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> imperial form of government
has sprung up in France within
seventy years, and been only slightly
modified by the different administrations
that have succeeded each other.
And yet nothing could be more at
variance with the traditions, customs,
and genius of the nation. This <i>régime</i>
is of foreign origin. It is the
recrudescence of the conquest of
Gaul by Julius Cæsar. It has subjected
us again to a yoke analogous
to the condition we were in after
Gaul lost its independence. The
veil that blinded us to its real nature
has fallen off in the shock of momentous
events. It is important to reassert
a truth that will now be better
comprehended. The historians of
the Revolution have endeavored to
show that the revolutionary movement
of 1789 was purely French,
and the result of national necessity;
but the very violence that accompanied
it proves the contrary. Natural
developments are effected peacefully.
Louis XVI., so far from resisting the
torrent, seconded it, and abandoned
himself to it. Nothing shows so fully
what an effort was necessary for
the triumph of the Revolution as
the impossibility of its succeeding by
regular means and the assent of the
country. It took France by assault.
It profited by circumstances, but
this does not change the nature of
its deeds or the character of its
success. We do not deny that
this pagan and Cæsarean tradition
might have found its way into
France with the monarchy, but it is
certain that, however restrained it had
been by Christian principles, it all at
once broke through its bounds. Half
the members of the Constituent
Assembly belonged to the legal profession.
Imbued with the absolutist
teachings of Roman law, they energetically
sought to apply them. The
Revolution recalls ancient Greco-Roman
days; there is nothing Christian
about it. What is the sovereignty
of the people but the very
principle that laid the foundation of
despotism in Greece? The title of
“citizen” implies that all Frenchmen
belong to the same city or town.
This rising <i>en masse</i>, and the notion
that every Frenchman is a soldier,
are wholly pagan. The legislative
corps&mdash;that means the people make
their own laws, only they do so by
proxy. What! the people not exercise
their special prerogative! In
ancient times, though the people
only amounted to a few thousand
voters, they never fully enjoyed the
legislative power. Besides, in consequence
of the institution of slavery,
every shade of democracy was
equivalent to an aristocracy. The
legislators of 1789 only recognized
the slavery of citizens with respect
to the state, which induced them to
create a power strong enough to
counterbalance and represent their
ten millions of constituents.</p>

<p>Their proscriptions, denunciations,
conspiracies, and struggles recall
the time of Marius and Sylla. It is
worthy of notice that in the revolutionary
documents the heroes of
Athens and Rome replace the saints
of the calendar. This imitation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
extremely amusing. A religion utterly
pagan follows. A Pantheon is
opened to modern divinities, and
great men deified. Catholicism undergoes
a persecution unsurpassed by
the persecutions of the emperors of
the first three centuries. It alone is
excluded from the Pantheon. Under
the empire, this imitation is so striking
that it is impossible to mistake it.
The Napoleonic era recalls that of
the Cæsars. In this new civilization,
or ancient civilization revived, new
terms are necessary to express the
changes made. Political language
is modified. First we have consuls,
then tribunes, then a senate, and at
last an emperor. The senatus-consultum
keeps pace with the plebiscitum.
The subdued provinces are
governed by prefects. The judges are
merely Napoleon’s delegates. The
whole of this organization is of foreign,
not French, origin. Our history
presents no parallel to it. And
the reality corresponds with the appearances:
it is the engrafting of
absolute power on the sovereignty of
the people. For the emperor never
disguised the source of his authority.
He always assumed to be the representative
of the people. Like Augustus
and Tiberius, he derived the
imperial inviolability from the tribunitian
character with which he was
invested. The empire had its <i>noblesse</i>,
but a <i>noblesse</i> of titles and decorations
similar to that of the Lower Empire.
All independence was denied
this <i>noblesse</i>. The army was likewise
organized after the manner of the
Roman legion. There were no longer
any local distinctions. Each regiment
was composed of a confused mixture
of the various French peoples. The
officers even did not belong to their
regiments. They knew, in their nomadic
life, only the will of Cæsar,
on whom alone they depended, and
who transported them from one regiment
to another, and from one place
to another. Passive instruments, they
had no will of their own. Therefore,
they were ready for anything.</p>

<p>Formerly, the army could not be
employed against the nation. It
represented the different social elements,
and enjoyed the independence
natural to these elements. The officers
retained their independence, for
they served at their own expense
from a sense of duty. The administration,
the bar, and the army under
the empire depended on one individual.
Neither local customs, nor
municipal corporations, nor right of
property could withstand this despotism.
A universal levelling under
the name of equality smoothed away
every obstacle before Cæsar. What
rank could stand before the formidable
title of the sovereignty of the
people? This Cæsarean power found
no embodiment in one of French
origin. It fell to an Italian, a Roman,
to one who rivalled Plutarch’s
heroes. This Italian assumed control
of the Revolution without ceasing
to be Italian, or rather Roman; for
Roman he was, a cosmopolite. His
aim was to restore the Roman Empire,
or the Empire of the West.
The French nation was to be the
means of universal conquest, as the
Gauls in the hands of his predecessors,
the Cæsars. Of old France he
preserved no vestige. And he carried
into Italy his achievements in France.
He extended the Revolution to Spain.
There was nothing French in a single
characteristic of his genius. And his
race have obstinately pursued the
imperial career which he opened.
His nephew, like himself, a mixture
of astuteness, violence, boundless
ambition, utopianism, literary tastes,
and fatalism, renewed the glory of
the empire. Louis Napoleon also
belonged to all lands. Italian, Swiss,
German, English, American&mdash;he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
something of them all. He spoke
all languages as well as the French,
and his French was that of a refugee.
During his reign, he assembled around
him none but foreigners. His apartments
were never clear of the
outlandish people he had become
acquainted with in his wanderings.
He loved to converse with them, to
tell them his plans. And these adventurers
enjoyed being with him.
They found him as utopian as ever,
as unchanged in his notions, and the
phenomenon interested them. No
Frenchman of note consented to
serve him. France was given up to
foreigners. They penetrated everywhere,
and took possession of the
country. Imperial cosmopolitanism
attracted them, and sheltered them,
and overloaded them with favors.
French policy became English, Italian,
American. The denationalization
of France was effected by the
laws, public schools, new manners,
and the transformation of Paris into
an European capital of pleasures and
the arts: France disappeared. This
system was overthrown when, arrived
at the highest pitch of madness,
Louis Napoleon, after effecting the
unity of Italy, so powerfully aided
King William in setting up the new
Empire of Germany as a rival to
France. He sacrificed France to the
triumph of the imperial idea in Italy
and Germany.</p>

<p>The Bonaparte family is completely
destitute of patriotism. Its cosmopolitan
character is constantly asserting
itself. Louis Napoleon’s foreign
policy was essentially anti-French.
His constant desire to effect the
unity of Italy and that of Germany
was the wish of an alien. Our interior
legislation became no less opposed
to the national character.
What is the civil code but the
systematization of principles laid
down in the Digest? The right of
property restricted by the legislator,
family rights suppressed for the benefit
of Cæsar, and property, as well
as individuals, placed under administrative
direction&mdash;all this is Bonapartism
as well as Cæsarism. Outside
of the central power, there was no
authority possessing any freedom of
action in France. No municipal
body was safe from dissolution. No
corporation was allowed to stand
alone. Obedience became the lot
of the French; which does not imply
order and unanimity, for the government,
with contradictory aims, and
without any real permanence, imposed
laws that were contradictory and
impracticable. The distinguishing
feature of Bonapartism is the union
of liberal theories with absolute power.
In spite of universal suffrage
and deliberative assemblies, despotism
increased and was strengthened.
It even relied on the opposing and
controlling influences it created. The
senate and the legislative corps were
subservient to the empire, and sustained
it. The idea of equality and
liberty constantly held out by high
imperial functionaries contributed to
the popularity of the Napoleons.
Under the late <i>régime</i>, Prince Jerome
Napoleon was charged with representing
the democratic side of the
imperial government. But we know
now, by the revelations of the papers
found, that his opinions always
coincided with the emperor’s. This
was what may be called playing into
each other’s hands. The tip of the ear
shows itself in those liberal speeches
which were apparently most hostile
to the government in such a way
that no one who knows how to read
can fail to perceive it. Under his
forcible language is concealed a
faint, half-expressed, vague opinion,
but which is clearly and positively
opposed to the rights of assemblies.
What enthusiastic liberalism did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
M. de Persigny manifest! According
to him, provincial liberty was
upheld by the <i>préfets</i>, whom he
styled, on one occasion, the fathers
of the departments. This sally caused
much laughter, but M. de Persigny
did not laugh. This same
minister bethought himself of some
conflicting elements that had evaded
the superintending eye of Cæsar.
It occurred to him to place his master
officially at the head of the secret
societies, and he transformed free-masonry
into an imperial institution.</p>

<p>The despotism that has weighed
on France for seventy years is unknown
to the rest of Europe. We
do not say that other nations have
not undergone various degrees of
despotism, but the despotism of a
dictatorship founded on the sovereignty
of the people is a privilege
France alone has enjoyed. A dictatorship,
that institution of republican
Rome, has been known here
since 1789. Successive governments
have been set up in the name of the
people; they have all been ephemeral;
they have acknowledged no
other will but their own&mdash;at least, in
the beginning. The dictatorship is
renewed every ten years. At Rome,
before the empire, it has been calculated
that every three years and a
half a dictatorship was established,
which lasted six months or thereabouts.
Our situation, therefore, is
preferable. It may, however, be
questioned if it is the ideal of a
Christian nation. Louis Napoleon
became the open apologist of Julius
Cæsar: he took sides against the
Gauls and Franks, who were our ancestors.
This audacity excited universal
astonishment. The Romans
from the beginning were accustomed
to absolute power and anarchy.
In the vast series of revolutions that
make up their history, we find no
fixed form of government. The
consuls, prætors, and tribunes at
Rome, and in the provinces the
proconsuls and governors, exercised
unlimited power. The emperor was
only a perpetual dictator. Roman
civilization was absolute power opposed
to the liberties of foreign and
barbarous nations who preserved a
primitive social organization, and
lived under patriarchal institutions.
The Roman historians acknowledge
that the barbarians fought for liberty.
The Romans governed the provinces
as, at a later period, the Turks governed
the countries they conquered.
Science and literature have depicted
their sanguinary course with brilliant
sophistry, and erected it into a system.
There is no doubt that the
thousands of jurisconsults who devoted
their talents to the empire
never questioned the legitimacy of
Cæsarism. They did not even comprehend
German liberty. They often
spoke of it with a rare ignorance.</p>

<p>Tacitus sometimes forgets the fidelity
with which he has described the
manners of the Germans. He passes
this singular judgment on a people
of Thrace whose independent spirit
he mentions: <i>Ne regibus parere nisi
ex libidine soliti</i><a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>&mdash;they obey their
kings only according to their caprice
or humor. To us this has no sense.
Tacitus sees that these people obey
sometimes, but not always. He does
not perceive the link that connects
these two facts. To obey through
humor or caprice is not to obey at
all. What is their legal obligation?
It is sufficient to examine their barbarous
institutions. The barbarous
king is neither a dictator nor consul:
he is like a father. His authority is
limited by other heads of families
and by their customs. The tribe
obeys, but only after discussing the
point in the assemblies of the nation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
The people obey when the king has
received the necessary approval of
the established authorities. There is
not, as under the Roman government,
a man who rules, and a nation that
obeys. This dualism does not exist
among the barbarians. The king is
a part of the nation, as a father is of
his family, which attributes a high
dignity to both king and father, but
not great power. Unity of action,
in this case, comes by the concurrence
of wills. This concurrence is
permanent, and the easier because
nature, through the family ties, softens
difference of opinion, lessens
rivalries, and produces men of incontestable
authority whose very birth
commands respect. Their laws are
less severe and stringent, but liberty
reigns, and society is based on the
affections, and not on the mere predominance
of force. Tacitus would
be more intelligible if he said that
the people only obeyed after giving
their approval according to forms
which custom had established. Strictly
speaking, the word <i>libido</i> might
imply either consent or assent. The
idea is somewhat obscure. But there
is nothing to authorize a translator
to say the people obeyed their king
only through caprice or humor.
Tacitus finds it difficult to comprehend
the organization of the tribe,
and does not regard it as of much
account. He judges like a Roman
who has a clear notion only of military
rule and passive obedience. In
spite of himself, however, he dwells
on these barbarians, who inspire him
with a kind of terror. He points out
the effects of their patriarchal institutions
from which the liberty of modern
nations has sprung. His books
are for us a title of honor. Our ancestors
figure therein as conquered:
their features are changed, but not
unrecognizable. We love to find
proofs that the traditions of liberty
among the French race preceded
the importation of despotism.</p>

<p>Despotism came to us by the way
of revolution. This will not surprise
any one. The empire is the highest
and most definite form of despotism
among civilized nations. Our enlightenment,
or pretended enlightenment,
so far from having any repugnance
to it, evidently led to it. Are we
more enlightened than the Greeks
and Romans? Are our rulers better
versed in art, law, or literature than
the rulers of Athens or Rome? The
idea of despotism has been so infused
into the modern mind that even
the extreme partisans of liberty can
conceive of nothing but despotism as
the basis of their theories. M. Jules
Simon, the worthy successor of M.
Duruy, dreams of subjecting France
to the communist system of Spartan
education. And hardly any one
ventures to oppose him. What notions
of liberty have children reared
by the state? They are brought up
in the official world, imbibe its sentiments
and the ideas of the state,
and reproduce them in their public
and private life. We who cannot
consent to the suppression of the
family are desirous that children
should bear the impress of family influences.
The family yoke is sweet
and light; the assimilation of children
to their parents is easy. The
liberty of children is guaranteed.
Family authority is a less burdensome
restraint than that of the state,
and the multitude of families creates
a sort of counterpoise, so that their
minds are not formed by a single
will, but develop according to their
various aptitudes. If any one objects
that the state teaches no doctrines,
we reply that to teach none is to
teach some. In fact, this is really
the source of indifference, or the system
of practical atheism. Is not this
the doctrine that is agitating France?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span></p>

<p>Our government has been copied
from the Cæsarean government.
Everywhere is to be seen a gradation
of functionaries who receive
their orders from Paris, and are not
opposed by any provincial action capable
of resisting them. It is useless
to enumerate all the public or
collective offices in order to show
how they are combined under a single
impulsion. No country in Europe
has attained to such perfection
of the imperial <i>régime</i>. The Roman
Empire even has been surpassed,
for we have the advantage of the
press, railways, and telegraphs, which
increase the power of the state to an
indefinite degree. New ideas have
also arisen to the aid of this despotism.
Political economy declares the
loan to be the best of investments.
The patrimony of future generations
has been invested in bonds regulated
by the present generation. By successive
loans, all individual capital
has fallen into the hands of the state.
In a more or less indirect way, the
state has taken possession of all the
charitable or other funds created by
associations or individuals. Confiscations
are not nominally practised,
but by the ingenuity of our fiscal system,
and the skilful apportionment of
the taxes, the whole value of the soil
passes into the fiscal treasury in forty
years. This is really a kind of confiscation.
Cæsarism found out how
to transform the Chamber of Deputies
into a fiscal instrument. Instead
of moderating, limiting, or abolishing
the taxes, the Chamber of Deputies,
and especially our recent legislative
corps, have studied how to
increase them. All the representatives
of the people have looked upon
their constituents as subjects to be
taxed and made use of. The government
has had more income from
the taxes than it wanted. This
work of communism has been applauded
in a thousand revolutionary
papers. In this respect, the republican
assemblies have not differed from
the imperial. Whether the deputies
were chosen by the ballot, by the
nomination of Parisian committees,
or the appointment of the Minister
of the Interior, the state of the case
and the result have been the same.</p>

<p>The organization of our army is
entirely Cæsarean. Though levied
from the whole country, it takes
cognizance of nothing that is local
or provincial. Individual measures
are repressed by the bureaucracy,
which is subservient to Cæsar because
it is detached from the soil,
and is influenced only by the hope
of promotion.</p>

<p>But the French magistracy at
least enjoys independence? It did
previous to 1789. The government
did not interpose in the appointment
of magistrates. This system, otherwise
very defective, did not err
through servility. The empire, artfully
retaining a certain semblance
of the ancient <i>régime</i>, was careful
not to do so where the independence
of the magistracy was concerned.
The emperor nominated all the
magistrates, and made them removable
at pleasure. This system did not
suit the Restoration, and immovability
was established. Under Louis Philippe,
the magistracy rapidly diminished.
The more honest felt themselves
bound by their oath, and refused to
serve the royalty of July. But the
Third Empire, by its administrative
practices, effaced the last trace of
judiciary independence, and destroyed
the permanence of the office by the
prospect of lucrative advancement.
Hitherto money had not seemed to
be the aim of the magistrate. The
idea of a career to pursue never entered
his head. The magistrate did
not have to earn his livelihood, and
he belonged to his native place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
where, regarded with universal respect,
he lived on his own fortune,
which was the exterior pledge of his
independence. The needy and the
ambitious did not seek such a post.
The empire raised the salaries of the
magistrates only to make the office
accessible to that class of people who
are ready to obey at whatever cost.
Immovability was illusory when the
greater part of the magistrates, desirous
only of advancement, went from
one place to another according to
the ministerial humor. Besides, the
government asked nothing better
than to have in each locality transient
magistrates who were strangers
to the people, and only awaited an
opportunity of ascending the ladder
of promotion. This allurement was
more efficacious than fear in effecting
the change in our judiciary customs.
The justiceship of the peace, which
ought to be a kind of rural and local
institution, and which for some time
preserved that character, speedily degenerated.
The empire at last ended
by bringing it completely under the
yoke of centralism. Instead of being
the independent arbiter of petty
quarrels and trivial interests that required
immediate solution because
they were not worth the expense and
delay of a suit, the justice of the
peace now found himself an electoral
agent, and implicated in politics.
He had to be chosen from the nomadic
class of civilians. To prevent
all ties with the people, fees were
done away with, and his salary made
equal to that of the judges of the inferior
court. The pretext was made
that the dignity of the magistracy
did not allow a judge to receive perquisites.
The truth is that there
was a very different reason. The
justices of the peace, being natives
of the country, and already in possession
of a patrimony, had no eye to
the fees. Many of them had scarcely
any. On an average, the perquisites
did not amount to more than
five or six hundred francs, and were
not always easily collected. A mere
income of seven or eight hundred
francs was not sufficient to attract a
stranger, especially when there was
no prospect of promotion. The empire
sought to bind the justices of
the peace closely to itself, and deprived
the office, practically speaking,
of its perpetuity, for the same
reason that it had made the assize
judges removable. The justiceship
of the peace, having been made a
round of the judiciary ladder, became
accessible to those civilians or agents
who only asked to serve the government.
Our judiciary army, as numerous
as our administrative army,
and composed of agents nominated
directly by the state, had, then, but
one course open to it. Its apparent
immovability no longer hid anything.
Those who are familiar with the
affairs of the empire know what to
think of a magistracy which takes it
upon itself to sound its own praises.
Though founded on very different
principles, the French magistracy, by
a sudden deviation, has gone back
to the Cæsarean type of Byzantium.</p>

<p>This mixture of the appearance of
freedom with despotism is natural to
an absolute power resting on a popular
basis. We cannot see how it
could be otherwise. Ancient Rome
afforded the same spectacle. The
Cæsars never ceased to repeat that
they were the representatives of the
people, and the defenders of national
liberty. We are not astonished that
the French government which sprang
from the Revolution has assumed this
attitude. The Romans only admitted
Roman civilization, which they
called “Roman peace.” Their poets
often speak of “the majesty of
Roman peace.” Civilization, then,
consisted in obeying the proconsuls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
paying the taxes, furnishing recruits,
and working on the roads and public
monuments. At this price, the provinces
enjoyed a little tranquillity.
It is noteworthy that the French
Revolution assumed to be the only
light capable of guiding the world
in the way of liberty, equality, fraternity,
progress, civilization, comfort,
etc. Its disciples still assert
that France is continuing to fulfil
this mission. This is what Louis
Napoleon meant when he said that
France alone contended for an idea.
This immeasurable pride in thinking
ourselves superior to other nations
has had to bow down. It was not
by virtue of our actual qualities that
we undertook to assume such a
supremacy, but, on the contrary, by
virtue of the errors and vices that
have sprung up in modern times.
In the XVIIth century, when our
moral superiority was acknowledged
and incontestable, no Frenchman
ever advertised any pretension to
overrule other nations, or believed
that our nation was destined to precede
others in order to enlighten
them. This pretension sprang up in
1789, at the time when a new system
was promulgated in the midst of the
terrors of the Revolution. Supposing
this idea to be new, what right had
France to impose it forcibly on other
nations? Europe rose in arms to
repel revolutionary or Cæsarean invasions,
and before the coalition
France has three times fallen.</p>

<p>We have been sobered by this experience.
The <i>rôle</i>, brilliant as it
was, has only left us bitter remembrances.
It remains for us to govern
ourselves without any pretension
to govern others. Our political and
military organization has suddenly
crumbled to pieces. That masterpiece,
which was a combination of
contradictions, order, and disorder,
is now only a ruin. Lamentations
are heard on all sides. It is perceived
that, under the pretext of
equality, all Frenchmen have been
reduced to equal powerlessness.
When men of good-will sprang up
on every hand to the help of France,
leaders were wanting; there was no
one to direct. Overwhelmed in the
first place by number, we ended by
overcoming that difficulty, and then
there was a deficiency of organization.
Leaders and discipline are
not the work of a day. If education
has not developed individual ability,
in vain will you seek for genuine,
natural, and acknowledged leaders.
The spirit of the family alone, by
forming the character, habituates
men to a necessary subordination.
The atheism of the state tends to
root out of every conscience the sense
of duty. How obey, if we do not
comprehend the obligation of obedience,
and if those who rule over us
do not seem worthy of ruling us?
Discipline is a certain moral order.
It should first exist within us by submission
to Providence and to the
social order established by Providence.
Imperial and republican
despotism have aimed at moulding
the whole French nation after one
single type. And when the overruling,
guiding will was gone, the whole
nation was paralyzed. The Roman
Empire had the same fate. It fell
both in the east and west from
causes analogous to those that are
preying on us. An able despotism,
a vast material organization, admirable
military traditions, and the assent
of the people, could not ensure the
stability of the brilliant communities
of Rome and Byzantium. The same
principles must lead to the same
consequences: no stable form of
government; the supreme power
constantly at the mercy of elections,
factions, and violence. The Cæsarean
system, whenever it obtains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
sway, gives glory, and grandeur, and
brilliancy to society, but also leads
to anarchy and incurable weakness.</p>

<p>Roman civilization was overthrown
by pastoral nations: in the East, by
the Arabs and Turks; in the West,
by the Germans. Cæsarean France
easily obtained the ascendancy over
Italy, Austria, and Spain, because,
already initiated into Cæsarism by
Roman law, they offered but slight
resistance. But when it undertook
a struggle with Germany, its fortune
changed, because that country has
many strong elements opposed to
Cæsarism and the principles of the
French Revolution. Its <i>esprit de
famille</i>, its tendency to decentralization,
and its official morality, superior
to ours, are among the differences
that carry us back to the invasions
of the first four centuries. Cæsarean
France has played a great
part against modern Germany. But
France is not so thoroughly Cæsarean
as the Roman Empire. Its interests,
its customs, and its traditions,
impregnated with Catholicism, resist
this assimilation. The Italian astuteness
of the Bonapartes succeeded in
making us think despotism would
lead to liberty. Our eyes are painfully
opened to the imperial <i>régime</i>
and modern institutions. We can
no longer deny that our social condition
has approximated to ancient
Cæsarism, and reproduced its principal
conditions. The empire did not
even conceal this imitation. The
public works and the plebiscitum
were the popular side of this <i>régime</i>.
No nation of Europe has experienced
anything comparable to it. In
no other has the government become
the contractor and general constructor
of all the public works.</p>

<p>The Roman Empire alone presents
a similar spectacle. The emperors
provided for the amusement of the
Roman people. They instituted festivals
and games. They everywhere
erected buildings for ornament or
public utility, the ruins of which are
still famous. The great monuments
of our ancient monarchies were due
to individuals, guilds, and the zeal
of the faithful. The state did not
interpose. Since 1789, the state
alone has erected edifices because it
alone has had wealth. This system
of public works is only one form of
communism. Though Louis Napoleon
had no taste for the arts, he
had a passion for building. This
phlegmatic Cæsar, like the Roman
emperors, made it a duty to amuse
the people. Family gatherings and
the old festivals authorized by religion
did not meet with his approval.
Such festivals are, from their very
nature, anti-Cæsarean. They recall
principles and sentiments opposed
to Cæsarism. But the individual
must not escape Cæsar. Public
amusements have a certain influence
of their own. They must divert the
mind from all the influences of family,
corporations, and religion, and
partake of the vulgar communism
authorized by the state. It is thus
Cæsar undertook to amuse the people.
Who does not know what the
Paris theatres became? The towns
in the provinces followed the movement,
constrained by the <i>préfets</i> and
mayors. Corruption, promoted by
books and official addresses, was put
in practice in every theatre of the
empire. When the immense bazaar
of the Universal Exposition was
opened, Louis Napoleon invited all
the sovereigns of Europe to be present.
They had no wish to attend,
but yielded to his importunities.
They held a grudge against their
Amphitryon. That was not the only
mark of superiority he affected with
respect to them. He proposed a
congress to sanction the principles
of the French Revolution. He neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
no opportunity of influencing
their policy. He was constantly
shaking the thrones of Europe by
his democratic pretensions. He believed
himself alone to be legitimate,
and pitied the other sovereigns who
lacked the consecration of universal
suffrage. Experience has once more
shown us that immense powers may
rest on fragile foundations, but the
lesson will be of no use to the Bonapartes,
who are ready to recommence.
Shall it be lost on France?</p>

<p>Our revolutions and various <i>coups
d’état</i> within a century have transformed
us into a Cæsarean nation.
All our political elements bear the
impress of this fatal destiny. The
army, the magistracy, the administration,
and the schools are disciplining
us for this social system. There is
no power but the state. Property is
no longer managed according to the
wishes of the proprietor, but by those
of the legislator. Luxury has increased
to an astonishing degree. How
easily it has pervaded all classes of
society! It is the government that
has led us to yield to these new
requirements of fashion. Economically
speaking, luxury is waste of
capital, and an unproductive expenditure.
Old French society, founded
on the right of property and the
permanence of families and fortunes,
rejected luxuries, superfluities, and
useless expense. In everything, it
had an eye to the solid and durable.
That, in fact, was the character of
French industry. The Roman Empire
was a stranger to lasting influences
and hereditary fortunes. Proscriptions
and confiscations made
short work of them. Nothing must
appear to rival Cæsar, and manifest
any power or independence. Christian
society pursued and attained a
different object. With us, the civil
code takes the place of confiscations
and proscriptions; it takes care that
fortunes are as speedily wasted as
acquired; it ruins by periodical
liquidations families scarcely formed.
In spite of this, the instincts of nature
incline us to a certain care of our
property. Speedily acquired fortunes,
made by commerce, industrial pursuits,
or legal transmission, became a
source of anxiety to the imperial mind.
They might foster independence!
Thence the constant preoccupation
of the empire to lead the whole
nation into luxurious habits by the
temptation of pleasures and large
salaries. The multiplication of cabarets
is an unmistakable evidence of
this. Obliged to expend more than
they gained, the office-holders remained
in servitude. And from one to
another the emulation has extended
throughout France. Cæsar not only
amused the people, but, led away by
example, the people sought additional
amusements at their own expense.
Thus property, idly spent, and lacking
the permanence that assures independence,
ceased to limit or be an
obstacle to Cæsar’s will. All wealth
became dependent on the public
credit and the stock market, and
had an interest in the continuance
of Cæsar’s reign. The whole interior
policy of the empire was
based on this principle. The political
institution of luxury kept pace
with the theatre and literature.</p>

<p>The immorality of Cæsarism may
be readily understood. Morality in
a nation is solely engendered by
domestic life. But the family is the
<i>bête noire</i> of Cæsarism. It was by
destroying it and assuming its functions
that Cæsarism succeeded in
training the people. A man, separated
from his family and the place
where he ought to live, and transported
to another region where he
is only accountable to the state, a
stranger to the people among whom
he lives, no longer thinks about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
morality, but the service he must
render to the state. How many
functionaries, inadmissible in one
place on account of tricks frowned
upon by public opinion, are sent
elsewhere without losing the favor
of the government!</p>

<p>France was as surprised by the
invasion as the old world by the
deluge. Let us admire her patience
and courage. We must remember,
however, that it was not Cæsarism
that saved her. The official world
had disappeared. What remained
rather clogged than aided the movement
for repairing our disaster. Our
deliverance sprang from the people
not enrolled under the official banner.
Without a government, France
has shown her spirit of unity, and
revealed her moral and material resources.
It was not only the emperor,
but the whole empire, that surrendered
its sword to the King of
Prussia at Sedan. In the same way,
Napoleon surrendered to England
after Waterloo. The high functionaries
that only existed by the will or
caprice of Cæsar, and who only served
him by giving up all responsibility,
were suddenly left in darkness.
The emperor only sought <i>ex officio</i>
supporters. In a country like
France, these are always to be found.
Messrs. Morny, Billault, Troplong,
Rouher, and Ollivier had pliancy of
mind enough to say and do anything
to palliate and excuse everything.
Thus, without any counterpoise, the
imperial government consisted in a
single will which was intermittent,
fluctuating, and a perpetual source
of troubles and catastrophes to
France. History is not a casualty.
It has its laws which control events.
It is well to repel invasions; it is
better to do away with their cause.
Demosthenes replied to the Athenians
who sought news of Philip:
“Why, of what consequence is it?
Should he have perished, you would
create another by your dissensions.
The Macedonian domination is only
the result of Greek anarchy.”</p>

<p>The French Empire, like the Roman,
is the creation of historic necessities
produced by an age of revolutions
and the application of principles
that only find complete development
under an autocratic form. Anarchy,
in a proud and powerful nation
with a glorious past and a warlike
spirit, will always end in military
supremacy. Christianity alone was
able to check the system of perpetual
war kept up by paganism. It framed
the law of nations, making them a
Christian republic. By the Revolution
of 1789, France abandoned this
system. The Restoration of 1814
re-established it in part, but in 1830
the European treaties were broken.
Europe had to be on its guard
against us, and exclude us from its
alliances. Louis Napoleon openly
and officially expressed his contempt
for treaties. With him France took
refuge in proud isolation, affecting
an intellectual dictatorship, the prelude
of wars. War alone, in fact,
can impose the will of one nation on
another. This reign of armed propagandism
has not ceased its manifestations
since 1848. The public
schools, all the academies, and the
entire press came to the aid of
Bonapartism. The personal enemies
of the emperor were his most active
auxiliaries. He was well aware of
this. He carefully promoted Carbonarism
in Italy, and Jacobinism in
France&mdash;two terms for expressing the
same thing. The attempts against
his life only promoted his success,
instead of being an obstacle to it.
He recognized, so to speak, their
justice, for he had taken the oaths of
Carbonarism. When he realized that
a crisis was at hand, he was not willing
for France to escape the Revolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
the reins of which he held with
apparent moderation. He successively
let loose the press, the clubs,
the secret societies, and even the
mob. He weakened and degraded
authority in the person of his agents,
assured the pardon of all political
offences, frequently changed his
ministers without any reason or pretext,
that the people might be convinced
that they were all puppets.
In this way, and under the pressure
of invasion, he seemed preparing
for a movement analogous to that
of 1792. His death then would
have thrown us into a state of
anarchy which would probably have
brought on the same invasion we
have just undergone. He left behind
him only reflections of himself.
When he disappeared from the scene,
all this was effaced. The regency
of Eugénie amounted to about as
much as the regency of Maria
Louisa&mdash;vain imitation, and a manifest
proof that, apart from the imperial
person, there was no imperial
government or recognized authority,
and that the empire and anarchy
were brother and sister.</p>

<p>The downfall of the French monarchy
plunged France once more
into a state of paganism. Our wars
and invasions have been of the same
character as the wars and invasions
of the first centuries of our era. The
French Empire had an insatiable
thirst to invade Europe. Germany,
on her side, has retained a power of
expansion that recalls ancient times.
She no longer emigrates <i>en masse</i>,
but by the indirect ways of modern
civilization. She first sends her
pioneers. Her tillers of the soil go
to the Sclave provinces of Austria
and the Russian coasts of the Baltic.
By their aptitude for labor, they take
the lead, amass capital, and end by
controlling the people that receive
them. There is a German party in
Russia, and this party has a controlling
influence over the czars, or
Muscovite Cæsars. The Sclave race,
more impressible, more poetic, and
less tenacious, less laborious, feels set
aside by the new settlers. It realizes
that it is the victim of its hospitable
and beneficent nature. A reaction
will soon take place. The czar will
be forced to take the national cause
in hand. Russia has not uttered its
last word. She has been in some
sort under foreign influence since she
imbibed the corrupt Christianity of
Byzantium. It was only under the
direction of the French philosophers
of the XVIIIth century that she
finally became a part of the European
world. After the wars of the
Revolution and the empire, our influence
greatly diminished, and yielded
to German influence. Destitute
of scientific or literary traditions,
Russia sent her young men intended
for office to the German universities.
They returned with the scientific
jargon of the schools, a strong dose
of atheism, affiliated with the secret
societies, and without any sympathy
with the tastes and sentiments of the
Sclave race. Thus favored, German
influence has increased to such a degree
as to cause anxiety in the Russian
Empire. In its encroachments
on Austria, Germany did not begin
with pacific conquests. Silesia, seized
by Frederic II., was colonized gradually.
Finally, German emigration
filled our banks, our counting-rooms,
and our railway offices. This tendency
to expansion could only be
restrained or repressed by our alliance
with a great nation. Unfortunately,
France affected to be above
European law. She pretended to
promulgate a new law, a new civilization.
She refused, in the name of
the principles of 1789, to allow that
there were any legitimate sovereigns
in Europe. France, plunged into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
Cæsarism, found a rival in Germany,
which had more ancient Cæsarean
traditions, and which, less ravaged
by revolution, was better organized
than we for attack and defence. It
is still increasing in population,
whereas France, under the rule of
economists, diminishes every day.
This alone ought to warn French
policy of the error into which it has
fallen. The German Confederation,
the imposing remains of Christian
ages, was the safeguard of Europe,
by maintaining a peaceful equilibrium
in Germany. France and England,
unwisely governed, allowed the German
Confederation to be dismembered.
The Germanic union under
Prussia was evidently threatening.
Lord Palmerston and Louis Napoleon,
statesmen who had no correct
notions of Christianity, could not see
anything or comprehend anything.
It was, however, evident that a peculiar
kind of Cæsarism was to spring
from this overturning of Germany.
A slight knowledge of history and
the German character should have
been sufficient to convince Europe
of this. The diplomacy which, by
the treaty of 1856, arraigned the
Sovereign Pontiff at its bar, rejoiced
at the destruction of the Germanic
Confederation, without dreaming that
a few years later the Empire of Germany
would consign the once powerful
nations of England, France, and
Russia to the second rank. At the
moment of this change, it is not
useless to remark how many deadly
struggles the Papacy has had with
Cæsarism. It was by the diffusion
of Christian principles that it laid the
foundation of Christian society.</p>

<p>The political life of the Papacy
has been wholly spent in combating
Cæsarism. It struggled against the
Roman emperors for three centuries,
and then against the heresies of Byzantium.
In our age, Napoleon exhausted
all his arts and violence on
Pius VII. Pius IX. found himself at
issue with Louis Napoleon, and Victor
Emanuel, the Italian representative
of Cæsarism. The contest of
the popes with the emperors of Germany
is celebrated. It was the Papacy
that preserved human liberty
throughout the middle ages. Germany
had seized the imperial sceptre
that had fallen from the hands of
the weak successors of Charlemagne.
In the XIIIth century, the Cæsarean
rule threatened the whole of Europe.
Frederic II., more perverse and
more able than his namesake of the
XVIIIth century, found himself the
master of Germany. He triumphed
in Italy through the support of the
legists, and extended his claims to
the rest of Europe. Innocent IV.,
by issuing the bull of excommunication
against Frederic II. at the
Council of Lyons, stopped the German
Cæsar in his career, and put an
end to the invasions of Italy he was
constantly making. Italy, under the
auspices of the Papacy, displayed a
long career of municipal liberty.</p>

<p>The development of Cæsarism in
France as well as in Germany has
followed the overthrow of the temporal
power of the Holy See. But the
German Empire will always retain
an immense superiority over the
French Empire. It is less revolutionary,
less democratic, less at variance
with its past history. It is not
impossible that it may combine with
the local and municipal institutions
of the country. Prussia is far from
our absolute centralization, and there
is nothing to indicate that she is to
be subjected to it. She remains the
ally of the great powers of the Continent.
She could easily have rallied
all Europe against imperial and
Byzantine France. Let us not deny
it: no victory of Louis Napoleon’s
could have secured the left bank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
the Rhine. The German coalition
would very soon have drawn the
rest of Europe after it. This struggle
of one against all is a necessity of
Bonapartism. Nothing can check
it. Softness of manners, a refined
civilization, pretended condemnation
of war, philanthropy bordering on
religion, boundless industry and
credit, the military incapacity of
Louis Napoleon, nor anything else,
could have prevented the war from
breaking out. “Revolution is war
and bankruptcy,” said Royer-Collard.
It obeys its nature. It upheld the
Bonapartes in spite of a kind of
material order and discipline they
forced on the people; it required of
them an armed propaganda which
they were more capable of managing
successfully than the republic
itself. Louis Napoleon, with his
mildness of character, and talent as
a writer, desired a peace that would
enable him to continue his utopian
experiments in journalism. But he
was not his own master. He felt
that a revolution at home constituted
only one-half of his obligations;
the other half&mdash;revolution abroad&mdash;he
was also determined to effect, though
to his regret. He regarded the
bombs of Orsini as a salutary warning,
and submitted to his destiny.
He extended revolution to Italy and
Mexico. He destroyed the influence
of Austria. Prussia profited by
these disturbances to unite Germany.
But Louis Napoleon made a pitiful
failure. He dashed against a wall
with his eyes shut. The pretext of
a Hohenzollern on the Spanish
throne was ridiculous, and the legislative
corps and senate that countenanced
it showed the measure of
their political knowledge and independence.</p>

<p>It is difficult to comprehend by
virtue of what principle or interest
he opposed the choice of a Hohenzollern.
Had he not rejected the
hereditary principle? Had he not
aided in overthrowing all the princes
of the House of Bourbon who still
reigned through this principle? Was
not his own power based on election?
And what did it matter to France
whether that pitiful Spanish crown
was on one head rather than another?
What gratitude could he expect from
those revolutionary sovereigns whose
patron or director he constituted
himself? He took the petty Subalpine
king by the hand, and led
him to the Crimea, and to the Congress
of Paris, and thence into all
the capitals of Italy. His plans
were unveiled when he forced the
unhappy Victor Emanuel to give
his daughter to the imperial cousin.
Who then could cherish any illusion
as to the result? It was unfolded.
Did the revolutionary union of the
south spring from it? This union
could only be effected by the unity
of despotism. Napoleon knew it:
his nephew forgot it. Revolutionary
nations are necessarily at war or distrustful
of one another, as the revolutionary
factions of a nation are
always contending, unless some master&mdash;no
matter whether it is an individual
or a party&mdash;succeeds in suppressing
the rivalry.</p>

<p>This was the state of the case in
our Revolution. Is it not a matter
of public notoriety that the name of
Napoleon excites only horror and
disgust in Spain and Italy?</p>

<p>Louis Napoleon’s aim was not to
subdue Europe by war, but to effect
an internal change of government by
means of revolutionary principles.
This resulted in exciting all the great
powers against him. He thought
there would be a revolution in Russia
in consequence of the emancipation
of the serfs which he recommended
to the Czar Alexander. He overthrew
the German Confederation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
though it was so powerful a guarantee
for the safety of France. It was
he who made William Emperor of
Germany. The overthrow of the
Confederation under the circumstances
in which it took place necessarily
led to the empire, as the overthrow
of ancient France led to the imperial
<i>régime</i> that has lasted till now. We
need not be astonished at the efforts
of the King of Prussia to re-establish
Louis Napoleon. They were accomplices,
though Louis Napoleon has
been taken for the dupe. Not that
he was not conscious of the situation,
but he warded off the flashes of reason
and common sense he had, and
gave himself up to a hallucination.
France imitated him, with the conscript
fathers of the senate and the
legislative corps at its head. Louis
Napoleon contended for an idea,
and he triumphed after his manner,
after the manner of his uncle. Conquered
and made prisoner, he was
humiliated, not by defeat, which
does not humiliate the brave, but by
accepting his defeat. He yielded to
the conqueror, he surrendered his
sword. Napoleon was defeated at
Waterloo, but he was not really cast
down till he found himself on board
the <i>Bellérophon</i>. Then he realized
who was victor. The lamentations
of St. Helena reveal the liberal despot.
Louis Napoleon also became
an author and a journalist. He
dreamed of returning to France.
He published at Cassel under the
name of his friend, M. de Grécourt,
a <i>brochure</i> designed to influence Germany
in his favor. He had no
doubt of being as warmly welcomed
by France as Napoleon was when
he returned from the island of Elba.</p>

<p>There was no change in France.
Our social institutions were still
standing. The republicans had
found nothing to modify in the
wonderful machinery of despotism.
There was nothing to prevent him
from resuming his place. There was
the invasion besides. Did the disasters
of 1814 prevent Napoleon’s reascendancy
in France in 1815?
Was there any lack of senators and
representatives to welcome Cæsar?
Was not the popularity of the uncle
the foundation of the nephew’s success?
That was the sole cause of
Louis Napoleon’s accession. This
popularity was nothing more than
the result of success. Power and
success united and counted the votes,
and proclaimed the result. The revolutionary
power was not entirely
destroyed by the events of 1814 and
1815; it became an organized system,
having its regulations, its leaders,
its journals, its secret societies, and its
permanent committees variously disguised
under the forms of beneficence,
pleasure, science, etc. No regular
government at variance with this
many-sided, intangible power could be
established. The regular government
of France especially&mdash;the hereditary
monarchy&mdash;could not take root
again. Public opinion and enthusiasm
are like stage machinery that
rises and falls. We witnessed the
workings of this machinery from
1848 to 1852. The inventors did
not even give themselves the trouble
to hide the workings from the eyes
of the public. This reign of opinion
has continued. The word of command
from the emperor was echoed
by the ministers, and from them by
the <i>préfets</i>, <i>sous-préfets</i>, and mayors.
The entire administration in all its
gradations walked in the same footsteps.
By the public works, loans,
and illusory promises, the mass of
electors were so fascinated that they
could refuse nothing to a government
that was promoting such benefits.
Universal suffrage is the character
in the comedy&mdash;the simple, good-natured
Demos of Aristophanes. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
reality, it is the emperor&mdash;he who has
the <i>imperium</i>, individually or by a
number of individuals, who votes at
the general election. In the Cæsarean
system, the emperor alone acts,
but he acts in the name of the people,
and as the representative of the
people. He is the voice of the people.
This must not be lost sight of
when we judge the acts of Louis
Napoleon.</p>

<p>In his <i>brochure</i>, he claims the good-will
of the King of Prussia and
Germany, because it was France
alone that desired the war. He did
not desire it; he was not responsible
for it. This was pleading his own
imbecility and the culpability of
France. What! he did not set France
against Germany? He did not break
the treaties of 1815, or officially condemn
them? He did not constantly
propose the policy of his uncle as an
example to France? He followed
it without condemning an act or a
principle. The Jacobinism of his
later years was a mere imitation of
the liberal ideas his uncle brought
back from the island of Elba, and
continued to cultivate at St. Helena&mdash;ideas
that M. Thiers, in his voluminous
compilation concerning the
empire, regarded as serious! This
was why Louis Napoleon declared
him “the national historian,” and
presided at the obsequies of Béranger,
“the national poet.” This Bonapartism
in verse and prose had only
one practical aim&mdash;the conquest of
the Rhine provinces. That was the
favorite topic of old soldiers and the
zealous members of the imperial
<i>entourage</i>. People of more sense,
who were not overscrupulous, resigned
themselves to it as a necessity of
the situation. Ever since 1852, it
had been thought there would be a
sudden blow aimed at Belgium or
Germany. Was not Austria attacked
in 1859 without any reason or pretext,
and, it may be said, without a
declaration of war, and in violation
of all the laws of nations? When
and where did universal suffrage
countenance this? Where was it
discussed by the ten million voters?
What authority did they give their representatives?
The imperialists and
liberals have refused the electors the
right which they enjoyed in 1789 to
give directions to those they elected.
The member represents, then, only
himself, though individually he may
have been acceptable to his constituents
at the time of the election.
The elector is not free in his vote,
because he does not know his so-called
deputy. And these representatives
of Cæsarism have never been
free. No sooner are they nominated,
than they forget their orders and
electors, and only aim at “the glory
of obedience” to Cæsar, like the
senators of Tiberius.</p>

<p>Louis Napoleon played to perfection
the game of Cæsarism. Conqueror
or conquered, he always kept
a foothold. Victory immortalized
him, and assured perhaps his son’s
future career. And defeat was not
to be imputed to him. As the representative
of the people, he was
only a passive agent. A docile instrument
of the passions and sentiments
of the people, he sacrificed
himself. Did not this entitle him to
the gratitude of his fellow-citizens?
He regarded the republic as less
popular than himself, and condemned
by universal suffrage. Besides,
he affected to personify in a supreme
degree the republican element. It
was not with respect to France he
was anxious. He knew that the
Cæsarean constitution of France
left a sure way always open of regaining
the throne. It was by
foreigners he was overthrown. He
preferred this fall to the necessity of
presiding over new disasters. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
was not sorry, either, to see the city
of Paris, which of late had been constantly
opposed to the empire, and
whose enmity daily increased under
its liberal laws, chastised by Prussia.
King William thus effected a <i>coup
d’état</i> which did not injure the emperor,
and made a return to despotism
easier than at the beginning of the
empire. <i>La Situation</i>, the Bonaparte
organ at London, insinuated that
Prussia had an interest in allying
itself with Louis Napoleon, in order
to reconstruct the map of Europe.
And it did not conceal that the
neutral countries, Belgium and Holland,
were to pay for this reconciliation.
In this way, Bonapartism,
though apparently crushed, showed
signs of life, and fostered its hopes.
This was a sign it was not morally
subdued. It was overcome only to
be restored. But the French republic
was not in a condition to restore
it, because it confounded itself with
it. It must be ascertained if Europe
feared Bonapartism or France. Bonapartism
aside, France is now a
really peaceful, honest, Christian nation.
She has only been formidable
since 1789 through the principles
of dissolution she has carried within
herself and diffused abroad by means
of newspapers, secret societies, and
armies.</p>

<p>The idea of giving Holland to
Prussia, and Belgium to France, was
worthy of Louis Napoleon. Would
Europe allow it? Prussia already
preponderates. France would gain
nothing. She could not rise from
the inferiority into which she has
fallen through late events. The
humiliation that Cæsarism has inflicted
on our country is not a thing
of yesterday. Napoleon stated the
problem clearly: France must subject
Europe to revolution, or disappear
before a torrent of invasions.
These two alternatives have been
successively more or less realized.
The Restoration gave peace once
more to France and to Europe.
France, regaining her rank, menaced
no one, and sustained herself by her
alliances. She fell again in the
Revolution of 1830. Foreign sympathy
was withdrawn from us. All
the alliances were broken off. The
various governments, stunned by the
rebound of the Revolution, stood on
their guard. The monarchy of July
sought to favor revolution moderately
abroad, and to direct it with
skill at home. From that time,
Europe formed a coalition against
us. During the first ten years of the
Revolution of July, the public mind
was disturbed as to the possibility
of a great war with Germany. The
liberal party used every effort to
bring it on, without any reason certainly,
in order to fulfil one of the
conditions of the revolutionary programme,
which is an armed propaganda.
It was with such views that
the fortifications of Paris were conceived
by M. Thiers. The equilibrium
of Europe was destroyed,
therefore, to our sole injury. The
empire developed the seeds of revolution
sown by the government of
July. France descended lower than
in 1830; she even lost all regard to
decency, by giving herself up to the
revolutionary current. The distinguished
men of talent who devoted
themselves to the service of Louis
Philippe withdrew from the scene,
and were replaced by a crowed of
nobodies. Assemblies, ministers, and
emperor entered on such a contradictory
course that one might believe
our country had fallen into its dotage.</p>

<p>The Mexican war made America
aware of our political weakness;
and, in the East, our diplomacy lost
the last remnant of its influence by
taking a stand apart from Catholicism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
The war of 1859 set Italy
against us&mdash;a country so lately governed
by princes favorable to France.
The Italian unity and German unity
consigned France to a secondary
rank. Finally, the commercial treaties
have made us subservient to
England. Thus, in renouncing all
idea of conquest, Louis Napoleon
did not give up disturbing Europe.
France served as the instrument of
this work, and ended by being the
victim. The material disproportion
of forces could only produce a catastrophe.
Europe was arming its men,
while France, under Louis Napoleon’s
direction, was plunged in revolutionary
metaphysics. It does not
require any great sagacity, however,
to perceive that a revolutionary
nation could not be in a condition
to sustain a conflict with a nation
that has remained true to conservative
principles. What could be
effected by combining all these
shattered elements? How could
we depend on these bruised reeds?</p>

<p>So rapid a decadence under the
influence of anti-social principles has
permitted neighboring nations to renounce
the traditions that bound
them to us. The admiration they
felt for the superiority of our civilization
yielded to the fear of falling
under a despotism as unprincipled
as it was senseless. It was from the
hotbed of Bonapartism, the inheritor
of revolutionary traditions, that have
sprung the various revolutions which
from 1814 to 1830 ensanguined all
Europe. The republic of 1848, exhausted
in the course of ten months,
consigned its stock of revolutionism
to Louis Bonaparte. He made it
yield with usury. Until 1859, he
hesitated and felt his way, being fettered
by public sentiment, which was
more conservative and Christian than
he could have wished. He skilfully
got rid of the honest people around
him, and, once started, he never
stopped again. From that fatal period,
he was no longer his own master:
he was the ready tool of the Revolution.
It is surprising that the Bonapartes
are not satisfied with reigning
over France; they think they have
a right to all Europe&mdash;a right to
substitute the sovereignty of the
people and elective governments for
all the hereditary monarchies. The
mission they claim secures the complicity
of all the malcontents. The
rulers assuredly take note of all this
danger. They understand that their
enemy in France is not France itself,
but the Revolution.</p>

<p>The German Empire rekindles the
fears that Louis XIV. inspired and
Napoleon made us realize. Owing
to a remnant of feudalism, it is
founded on a much more solid basis
than the French Empire was. When
it attains its utmost limit, there will
really be only one power in Europe.
Even now, no one would think of
denying its preponderance. The
balance of power can only be preserved
by the alliance of the secondary
powers&mdash;France, Russia, Austria,
and England. No one disputes the
superiority of Prussia. In order to
attain it, it would have been sufficient
to be preserved during the half-century
just elapsed from the revolutions
that have so lowered France
and Austria. Prussian statesmen
labored energetically to unite Germany.
By directing the mental
training in the universities, the secret
societies, the press, and the diplomacy,
they have shown a system
and energy that in France would
have enabled statesmen of another
stamp to bewilder and crush the genius
of France, and bring our nation
down to the dust. The Napoleonic
Empire was one vast treason. It
only allured France in order to deliver
it up to foreigners. By giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
her the choice between universal rule
and annihilation, he placed her in an
absurd position, and subjected her to
certain ruin for the greater glory of
Napoleon. It may here be remarked
that no man ever made a more
lavish use than Napoleon of the
word “glory,” which the pagans so
constantly had on their lips. It was
comprehensible to people that lived
to serve masters who, having all that
could gratify pride and power in this
world, aspired to glory as the supreme
recompense. It was under
similar circumstances that Napoleon
and his nephew sought and obtained
glory. Their names are imperishable.
They are connected with
catastrophes human memory will
forever retain. They refused to
reign peaceably by fulfilling their duties
as sovereigns. Rejecting a divine
authority, and recognizing no
higher power, they made use of the
people as the instrument of their
passions. One had a passion for
conquering Europe, the other for
revolutionizing it. And France had
to promote these designs, be drained
of men under the First Empire, and
be revolutionized under the Second,
in order that the revolutionary contagion
might be spread throughout
Europe. War, coming to the aid of
this work, led to the third invasion&mdash;the
crowning achievement of the
Third Empire.</p>

<p>The sole prejudice the French
manifest in favor of the empire is
that it maintained the honor of our
army, and restored order. This is
only true with respect to the Revolution.
For the Revolution was absolute
disorder. And the aim of the
empire was not to substitute order
for revolution, but to organize the
Revolution by making it possible to
the vulgar mind. It proved, therefore,
wholly incompetent to the work
of reorganizing society. Napoleon
succeeded republican anarchy, and
would have left us in it at his downfall,
had it not been for the House
of Bourbon, which saved us from
foreigners and revolution. The
nephew likewise succeeded his mother,
the republic, whose death he
hastened. And everybody knows
that his natural death at the Tuileries
would have been followed by
a triumphant republican rising at
Paris. He made every preparation
for that. The republic of the 4th of
September, 1870, was established
almost as a matter of course, without
violence, without noise. The <i>régente</i>
had orders not to oppose anything.
General Montauban declared to all
who would listen to him that he
should only offer moral resistance to
the expected demonstration of the
4th of September. In fact, after
Wissembourg, there was no imperial
government. That government,
then, was anarchical in essence and
administrative by accident. It only
rose momentarily above anarchy,
and speedily sank into it again. It
dreaded nothing more than a peace
that would strengthen institutions,
create new influences, and diminish
Cæsar’s personality. Louis Napoleon
was perpetually remodelling the
different institutions, and without
any apparent object. It was in this
way he did away even with the traditions
of the First Empire, and subjected
the army to so many ridiculous
experiences.</p>

<p>It doubtless seems singular&mdash;to
accuse the uncle and the nephew of
anarchy, when their putting down
anarchy was precisely their title to
govern France. But anarchy is not
the only feature of the empire: there
was despotism besides; and with
these original principles there was an
ingredient of political order which
we do not deny. When this side of
things became apparent, the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
threw themselves into the emperor’s
arms, and hailed him as the saviour
of the country. When all was lost,
they took hold of the first thing that
presented itself. In our modern
France, the empire and the Napoleons
are the only memories capable
of fixing every eye and directing
every vote at a given moment.
The salvage obtained, half the work
remains to be accomplished. In the
latter part of its task, the empire always
fails. Its principles hinder it;
they only favor order under conditions
which prevent its solidity. Why this
special hatred kept up by the Bonapartes
against the House of Bourbon?
The Bonapartes have nothing
against the Bourbons; our kings
had long lost their power when the
Bonapartes seized it. There is no
personal difference between them
and the Bourbons. We must look
beyond to find the connection between
the cause and effect. The
Bourbons and the Bonapartes are
above all that is individual and personal.
They represent two opposite
causes. By the intrigues of Louis
Napoleon, the offshoots of the
House of Bourbon have disappeared
from the thrones of southern Europe.
They are a living protestation
against revolutions. The Bourbons
have in vain allied themselves with
the revolutionary party, and ruined
their own cause; they never succeeded
in gaining the good-will of
their adversaries, so effectually have
their principles, which they cannot
divest themselves of, protected the
monarchical cause against themselves!
The House of Bourbon, in
its downfall at Naples and Madrid,
was elevated by its fall. The dethroned
Neapolitan king has shown
himself more Christian, more kingly,
than before he fell. The Spanish
monarchy, by the mouth of Don
Carlos, has expressed sentiments
truly worthy of a king, and contrasts
with the attitude of the elective and
liberal king who has just left. The
House of Bourbon has been purified
by the crucible of revolutions, because,
in spite of its failings and misfortunes,
it represents the principle
of right. The Bonapartes remain
true to themselves. They do not
vary in their <i>rôle</i> or in their pretensions,
and remain attached to principles
irreconcilable with the peace of
France and all Europe. The recall
of the Bourbons is an European necessity.
It will be more easily effected
when the wall of prejudice,
which has barred the way, is wholly
broken down. This European war
had been foreseen from the beginning
of the empire. Louis Napoleon,
in throwing the responsibility
of it on France, acknowledged that
he yielded to the fatality of his position.
What could be a more decisive
proof, and what other could be
wished, that the empire is war?
No one in France desired war. Nothing
was ready. The liberal party
curtailed every year the budget of
the army. Prussia gave us no excuse
for aggression; all the <i>chancelleries</i>
advised peace. It was then
that, a prey to the evil genius of his
family, to obsessions that deprived
him of sense and foresight, Louis
Napoleon made a sudden attack on
Germany, without looking to see if
he was followed, or how he was followed.</p>

<p>Our fault was in not being ready,
say the Bonapartists. That is an illusion.
At no price could the empire
have been ready. The military organization,
weakened by perpetual
changes, the corruption and lack of
discipline diffused among the soldiers
and under-officers by means
of the public journals and secret societies,
the limited resources available
under a system which affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
a kind of communism in the civil
order, and constantly encroached on
future supplies, rendered reform impossible.
Everything set aside the
thought of attempting it. The
budget paid 400,000 men, and our
army did not really exceed 200,000!
A reform in France on the Prussian
model would have required several
years and the overthrow of all our
modern institutions. Can we imagine,
with the other expenditures of
our budget, eight hundred millions
more for the army? Prussia has
been half a century in achieving its
present organization. Germany has
its gradation of ranks and classes.
A numerous nobility forms the basis
of its military institutions, and furnishes,
in time of war as well as
peace, the natural leaders of the
whole nation. And we Frenchmen&mdash;we
are still under the elective system,
which is that of children at their
sports. Leaders who are improvised
remain necessarily without authority,
unless they have been prepared for
their <i>rôle</i> by their previous life. Our
military organization corresponds to
our social organization: and it is
the empire, a military <i>régime</i>, but
also a Saint-Simonian <i>régime</i>, that
has co-operated actively in the military
dissolution of France. It was
by being mixed with Saint-Simonism
that it returned to the extreme notions
of 1789 and 1793. This socialism
that was to sustain the empire
against the clergy, the conservative
party, and the republicans, did
it weigh one ounce in his favor?
At the first reverse, all the socialism
in authority disappeared. And Louis
Napoleon has had no adversaries
more implacable than all these socialists
whom he fed, and who are making
up for their former servility by
their present abuse.</p>

<p>We must not weary of meditating
on these words: France fights for an
idea. This idea, under various names,
is the Revolution, socialism, and the
principles of 1789. Louis Philippe,
that emperor on a small scale, and
that “best of republics,” pursued the
same crooked way. He classed his
wars and foreign intrigues under the
mild term of “liberalism.” He propagated
in his way, by the assistance
of the Assemblies, the principles of
the Revolution. He gradually but
persistently violated the treaties of
1815, which had put an end to
twenty-five years of social war in
Europe. It was in violation of these
treaties that he ascended the throne.
He interfered in Belgium in the
name of the Revolution; he aided
greatly in the downfall of the Bourbons
of Spain; he occupied Ancona,
in spite of the Holy See, and indicated
a course to Gregory XVI. that
was identical with the terms of Louis
Napoleon’s letter to Edgar Ney.
Finally, less Catholic than M. Guizot,
he applauded the ruin of the Sonderbund,
and refused Prince von Metternich
the support of France in protecting
the interests of the smaller
cantons, our friends and ancient
allies. By his inaction, he favored
the revolutionary cause when he did
not serve it with his forces. The
revolutionary triumph at Berne soon
extended to Paris, and Louis Philippe
had to withdraw more speedily
than he came. He propagated revolutionism
in Europe during the
whole course of his reign, with less
display than Louis Napoleon, but
with as much perversity. Certainly,
neither Prussia, nor Austria, nor Russia
were deceived as to the cause
and tendency of the Revolution of
1830. They protested in vain. England
alone took sides with Louis
Philippe: thence the subserviency
of our policy to that of England.
Louis Philippe made the most of
that ally of the Revolution: through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
party spirit, he sacrificed even the
interest and honor of France. We
recognize there the soldier of 1789,
the former usher of the Jacobin club.
And Louis Napoleon, for the same
cause, humiliated himself more profoundly.
He put his ministers, his
assemblies, his diplomacy, our commerce,
and our industries at the feet
of England. And he certainly was
not ignorant that England would
never send him a shilling or a man.
But he knew that England protected
revolution on the Continent. He
bound her to the revolutionary cause
by the Crimean war and the commercial
treaty. England powerfully
seconded it in Italy and Spain. It
was Bonapartism that English policy
has developed even while thinking
it was making use of it. Coming
events will tell whether England has
not, by violating her traditions, hastened
a decline already evident and
even alarming.</p>

<p>It is possible that, by rejecting
the pretended English alliance, which
was never anything but a lure, France
would have been forced to closer relations
with the Continent, and to conform
to the European law of nations,
which would have saved Europe
from great calamities. The sovereigns,
then, have some interest in
withdrawing France from English
complicity. The Restoration alone
understood the practice of French
policy, and alone maintained a firm
attitude with respect to England.
Its whole policy, interior as well as
exterior, was national and uninfluenced
by England. The conquest
of Algiers was the most brilliant result
of that policy. The Restoration
made successful wars, and wars Europe
had no reason to complain of;
for they were carried on with the
consent of the powers, and to re-establish
the law of nations settled
by the treaties of 1815. Such was
the character of the war with Spain
in 1823. Peace reigned then among
all the great powers of the Continent,
and it was solely to the House of
Bourbon it was owing; that house
overthrown, a spirit of revolt broke
out on all sides, and made thrones
totter. What profit did France derive
from it? Condemning herself
by her institutions to perpetual war,
France pronounced her own sentence
of death. She conquered under
Napoleon only by the ability of
her leader, when she found herself
contending with one or two nations.
She successively defeated each of her
enemies. At length her armies were
made up of recruits from every country
in Europe; she incorporated the
vanquished through the same policy
as ancient Rome. It was an army
composed of soldiers from all parts
of Europe that Napoleon led into
Russia. The disaster of 1812 freed
Germany. Then, for the first time,
a serious coalition was arranged, and
Napoleon was defeated by the combined
forces in 1813, 1814, and 1815.
Louis Napoleon attacked Russia
and Austria separately. He isolated
Prussia from the great powers, but his
policy of nationality brought on German
unity. And it was the whole of
Germany that confronted him when
he merely wished to confront the
King of Prussia. The King of Prussia,
had he been defeated, would have
appealed to the Emperor of Austria
and the czar, who would not have
failed him. Our revolutionary tendencies
will always draw a coalition
upon us. The late events have
weakened the revolutionary party in
Europe to such a degree that the
support it offered us, and on which
we relied, will be of no more avail.
Europe, surprised by the outburst of
1789, yielded to our arms for twenty
years. She then united, and, imitating
the imperial military policy, carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
it to a degree of perfection
that left us behind. What remains
for France and all Europe but to
agree in re-establishing peace by conformity
of political principles? And
in 1873, as in 1815, this peace depends
solely on the recall of the
House of Bourbon to France. It is
to this work that Europe is invited
if she does not wish to perpetuate
a revolution which, after ruining
France, will not leave one of the
great powers standing.</p>

<p>The French Revolution has till
now been the object of public attention.
Princes and people have bestirred
themselves for a century to
oppose or sustain it. The inability
of the principles of 1789 to establish
anything, and the invasion of 1870,
have opened the eyes of France, and
better disposed it to make terms
with Europe henceforth. But beside
the French Revolution, now growing
powerless, rises a political element
that suddenly overawes and disturbs
European equilibrium. A policy of
defence and preservation ought to be
directed against the Empire of Germany,
not to destroy it, but to guarantee
the safety of other governments
by a general alliance and a new law
of nations. France will never declare
war against Europe again.
Louis Napoleon is the last to make
such a challenge. Personally, there
was nothing warlike in him; but he
represented a system that tends to
war. To him this war was an amusement,
a distraction. To divert himself
by a general war, in order to escape
for a moment from national
affairs that perplexed him! The
diversion was powerful; as well blow
out one’s brains to drive away <i>ennui</i>.
The mass of the French people did
not participate in the madness of
the Bonaparte system: they are victims
as well as Europe. Only we
have come to that phase of the system
which is more particularly humiliating
to France. The three
great allied powers of the North
have nothing more to fear from
France. But this alliance of the
North is no longer on terms of equality.
We say great powers! There
is now but one great power&mdash;Germany.
And she necessarily threatens
Austria and Russia by her military
strength and by her expansive power,
through her hardy and laborious
race, that is filling the United States
with swarms of colonizers, extending
to the neighboring Sclave countries
in Russia, and putting forth its shoots
even on French soil. German preponderance
will pursue its course.
It is not universal rule, but a preponderance
that will tend to it, unless
a union of the secondary powers oppose
it with a strong, resisting force.
Germany herself will not be wanting
in prudence. Her reign will last its
time; it is sure of only a short triumph.
In twenty-five years, Russia,
in consequence of the progress of
science and industry, will be able to
subjugate Germany. Germany will
then have need of France.</p>

<p>By a law of Providence, nations
that rise from an uncertain beginning
seem to attain their height suddenly,
and almost as speedily begin to decline.
We Frenchmen have had our
day of power and glory in the middle
ages. The age of Louis XIV.
was our era of intellectual superiority
and political preponderance. We
have come down from that pinnacle;
there is no denying it. Germany, by
its material strength, is rising far
above the point we attained. England,
France, Russia, and Austria no
longer have any influence, by their
diplomacy and alliances, over the
hundreds of petty princes and peoples
that constituted the German Confederation.
They are shut out of Germany.
Any pretension to interference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
would make them a laughing-stock.
All these powers, Russia excepted,
have pursued a foolish policy, and are
receiving the recompense due to their
shrewdness. Inheritor of Richelieu,
the French Revolution so disturbed
Germany as to overthrow all its
princes. The German nation has
survived, and by the concentration
of its unity has acquired a power of
aggression and conquest it was incapable
of under its former organization.
The Revolution of 1789 resulted
in the immediate elevation of
England, which from the third rank
rose almost to the first&mdash;a rank she
would still have, had she not replaced
the policy of Pitt and Burke by the
policy of Lord Palmerston and his
followers. Louis Napoleon created
the Empire of Germany, but England
applauded his course. All her
statesmen have rejoiced in the humiliation
of France that has resulted
from it. Those debaters and merchants
have advocated the establishment
of an immense military empire
in the heart of Europe, without perceiving
that peaceful and industrious
England would thereby lose its influence.
She is destined to decline
still further. Her influence on the
Continent depended on the old balance
of power, and preponderated
through her alliance with Austria.
In 1859, she betrayed Austria, and
shamefully disavowed the treaties of
1815. Austria turned to Russia, or
to Prussia, or to both at once.</p>

<p>The old kingdoms, the historic nations,
are breaking in pieces. In
reality, it is the Prussian Empire that
has been founded, rather than the
German Empire restored. Germany
retains enough of Catholic life to
give her a tone of moral and intellectual
grandeur that render her superior
to Russia and the United
States. There is nothing to disturb
her but the future, and a future not
far distant, if the people of Southern
Europe continue to abandon themselves
to revolutionary principles.
We are far from believing that France
can never rise again. She rose after
1815: the same causes produce the
same effects. What concerns Europe
is that France will never resume her
<i>rôle</i> of agitator. Bonapartism is still
powerful. It prevails through the
habits and necessities which concentrate
and direct the whole political,
moral, and mental activity of France.
This storm over, the name of Napoleon
will again disturb the public
mind, and unite the suffrage. The
republic of 1870 is dragging along
in the old beaten track of imperialism.
It has merely set up the men
of 1848 or 1830&mdash;old, worn-out functionaries,
whose incapacity has increased
rather than diminished. It
is time for a reaction against childish
prejudices. The motto of the liberal
school is: Revolution and Progress!
It is well to know that a revolution
is, etymologically speaking,
a turn back. Our liberals cling to
the days of 1789. In a few years,
they will be a century behindhand.
France rapidly rose from her helplessness
of 1815 to the Spanish war
of 1823, and the conquest of Algiers.
Then a fatal revolution arrested its
progress, and it fell back to a state
bordering on that of ‘89. Louis
Philippe kept us in subjection eighteen
years. He was overthrown by
the socialism which he restrained,
but which with a bound returned to
the theories of ‘93 in the name of
progress! These sudden relapses
disorganize and destroy the social
machine. The Restoration alone
was successful, because it was the
regular government. The House of
Bourbon is able to give interior peace
to France. It is not the government
of a party, for it does not derive its
title from the popular vote. It appeals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
to the conscience and reason
like a natural law and a national necessity.
It has no other ambition
but to make France once more a
Christian kingdom by ensuring the
general peace of Europe on the basis
of a new public law. What great
power will dare refuse her its aid,
when so strongly interested in the
same cause?</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c630" id="c630">ENGLISH DOMESTIC FESTIVITIES.</a></h2>

<p class="pc1 reduct">BY AN ENGLISH CATHOLIC.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Mediæval</span> England was the home
of merriment and the scene of all
manner of family festivals and athletic
rejoicings. Heir to the old
Norse traditions of Yule-tide, she preserved
the spirit of innocent and
manly sport better perhaps than
those less hardy and more polished
lands of the Mediterranean whose
pleasures were mostly such as could
be enjoyed from the vantage-point
of a balcony, and the soft resting-place
of a gilded ottoman. In England,
the national pleasures are pleasures
of action as well as of sight;
and, even in those specially destined
to commemorate the glories of an
ancient feudal family, the members
of the family do not recline in
luxurious ease, patronizingly looking
on at the feasts provided to do
them honor, but mingle with the
people, share in their games, and
compete for prizes with the rest.
This it is that distinguishes English
festivities from any other, and stamps
them with an individuality which in
the sequel has no little political significance.
The sister countries share
in this attribute of hearty good-fellowship
among classes, and indeed
what is here said of England may
be said interchangeably of Scotland
and Ireland.</p>

<p>Still, things are not done in our
day in precisely the same lavish
and baronial way that was common
in Tudor times, and a revival of this
generous style of entertainment,
though not infrequent, cannot be
called other than a rarity. This
certainly enhances the interest attaching
to one of these social relics
of the past; and the great pageant
two years ago at S. Paul’s Cathedral,
London, in thanksgiving for the
recovery of the heir to the throne,
was perhaps the most brilliant and
successful modern attempt to revive
the glories of England’s “golden
age”; but yet, in some measure,
more individuality attaches to country
<i>fêtes</i> than even to such a national
event as the “Thanksgiving Procession.”</p>

<p>Then, too, they are so little known
beyond the rural neighborhood in
which they occur that to us across
the ocean they come as fresh revelations
of the inner structure&mdash;social,
political, and domestic&mdash;of the great
mother country, whose language is
now that of the greater half of the
civilized world. Such a festival is
also rendered still more interesting in
our eyes when it takes place in a
Catholic family, under Catholic auspices,
and is pervaded with the
broad spirit of Catholic generosity.
The best days of “merrie” were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
those of “Catholic” England, and
the national character, now universally
known as the British&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, moroseness
and gloom of disposition&mdash;is
wholly a graft of the unhappy
Lutheran Rebellion. Unquestionably,
the most English domestic festival,
the most characteristic, and
the aptest to exhibit Englishmen of
all ranks and stations in their best
aspect, is a “Coming of Age.” This
is celebrated on the twenty-first anniversary
of the birth of the heir
to a large property, and is essentially
an outgrowth of the institution of
primogeniture.</p>

<p>In the instance of which we speak,
the festival took place in a Catholic
house, on the estate of the largest
land-owner of one of the midland
counties of England. There was a
large family gathering bidden from
all parts of the country; relatives of
all denominations met in perfect
peace and friendship round the board
of the Catholic head of their house;
there were clergymen and government
clerks, married sisters with
large families, old aunts in sufficiently
quaint costume, young lawyers,
parliamentary men, soldiers and sailors,
some with years of service behind
them, some with their spurs yet
to win; in fact, each generation, from
that of “powder and patches” down
to that of the nursery of to-day, was
impartially and favorably represented.
The house, a large, roomy Tudor
building, was still too small to
accommodate all the guests, and the
lodges and even the inns of the
neighborhood, had to be put into requisition.
When we drove through
the park on Tuesday evening, 10th
of October, 18&mdash;, the first thing that
struck us was seeing moving lights
in front of the house; and, our carriage
being suddenly stopped, we
found that the lights were carried by
E&mdash;&mdash; and the servants to prevent our
being shipwrecked upon tent-ropes
and poles! By that dim light, we
discerned the outline of the immense
tent run out from the end window of
the drawing-room; and, as we looked
at the preparations, the work really
seemed as if carried on by fairies, so
quickly and perfectly was it accomplished.
The place was looking lovely;
some of the beautiful trees were
just touched with the first tints of
scarlet and gold, others still fresh
and green. At the east end of the
Terrace Garden is a very handsome
stone balustrade, between the flower-garden
and the straight walk leading
to the old Hall (a ruined house,
once the family mansion, and now
standing in the grounds as a picturesque
ornament, and also a convenient
place for school entertainments,
servants’ dances, etc.) “To any
prosaic mind,” said a friend of ours,
“there is always great amusement in
watching work of any kind; and the
object for which all was going on gave
me such a real interest in it that I
do not think any one entered more
fully than I did into even the minutest
details of preparation.” Lord
G&mdash;&mdash;, the owner of the house, and
the father of the young recipient of
these patriarchal honors, gave Captain
W&mdash;&mdash; <i>carte blanche</i> about many
little things, and was so kindly pleased
with every endeavor: all the people
worked with <i>such</i> eagerness and
good-will. Old Philip (a garrulous
old carpenter who knows the family
history far better than the family itself!)
and Captain W&mdash;&mdash; made fast
friends in no time. The entrance
tent became in a few days very
pretty&mdash;lined with scarlet and white,
the floor covered with red, marble
tables at the sides; and at one end
on a table was placed Lord G&mdash;&mdash;’s
bust, and a pier-glass behind it, the
two corners of the tent at each side
being filled with plants of variegated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
foliage. Just opposite the entrance
was hung the large picture of the
<i>fête</i> at Fort Henry when Lord
G&mdash;&mdash; came of age (thirty or more
years ago); and very quaint indeed
are the costumes and most charming
the “bonnets” of the “period”; but
we were assured by Philip they were
all perfect likenesses! There were
light chandeliers suspended from
the roof, which had a fine effect
even in daytime, and sofas were
placed round the walls, so that one
only felt what a pity it would be
when such a pretty entrance hall
would be demolished! At one end
was the entrance, and the passage
to the front door, all filled with
flowers. Much fun went on whilst
all these things were being placed,
and some even said the preparations
would be the best part of all.</p>

<p>The hero of the festivities himself
arrived a day or two after us. Being
in the army, as are most young men
of good prospects in England, he
had hitherto been away with his regiment,
and only obtained leave of absence
for this occasion. He seemed
delightfully happy, but most naturally,
not excitedly; and throughout the
whole no one could be more unaffected
or unspoilt by being the one
object of all these rejoicings. Where
many a young man might have
shown himself over-elated, he was
exactly himself, happy and cheerful,
but quiet, calm, and always self-possessed.
When all the preparations
were finished, nothing could be more
beautiful. It is not too much to say
that they were princely, yet all was
in perfect taste and keeping&mdash;nothing
of vain show and ostentation,
thoroughly refined, and so truly represented
by the word which to our
mind conveys the highest praise, <i>gentlemanly</i>;
above all, everything was
arranged for the happiness and rejoicing
of others, of high and low, of
rich and poor, and nothing overlooked
which could gratify the feelings
of participants. On each of the
different approaches to the house,
the banners, placed at different distances
on each side of the drives,
had a beautiful effect, as well as the
larger flags on the house, on the old
Hall, on the church-tower; and these
brilliant colors were set off by the
more varied and almost equally rich
tints of the trees. On Monday (the
16th October), the festivities began
in earnest. The first act was our all
going directly after breakfast up to
the old Hall to see the gigantic cask
of 21-years-old ale opened, and, as
in duty bound, to taste the ale to
Charlie’s health. The universal custom
in England of brewing a large
quantity of the very best ale the year
an heir is born, and keeping it untouched
until the day he comes of
age, when the cask is broached and
distributed in prudently moderate
quantities to the guests and tenants,
is of very ancient origin, and is most
religiously adhered to. Another custom
is that of planting an oak-tree
near the house the year of the heir’s
birth, to commemorate the event,
and the sapling is always called after
its human foster-brother. This tapping
the ale was like reading a page
out of some memoir of former times,
and reminded us of the stories of Sir
Walter Scott.</p>

<p>The cavernous cellar in which
stand the mysterious casks, the ivy-grown
ruin overhead, the brawny
men opening the family treasures,
and serving as rustic cup-bearers to
the guests, all made a thorough old-time
picture. Some of the party,
after this ceremony was over, left us
to go to the first village feast, the
prototype&mdash;a description of which
will equally fit all the others. There
are seven villages on the estates, and
each felt itself entitled to a separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
local entertainment. Ridlington,
which supplies the family with one
of its many titles, was the first to experience
its lord’s hospitality.</p>

<p>The feast consisted of an abundant
supply of meat, ale, and cakes
for men, women, and children alike,
with games on the village green,
races for simple prizes, such as articles
of useful clothing, etc. The
greased pole formed the chief attraction
for the men and boys, and of
course was productive of the greatest
merriment, through the harmless accidents
to which it inevitably exposes
the candidates for the honors of successful
climbing. During the repast,
speeches were freely made and
healths proposed, every one much
alike, but all interesting, through the
hearty reciprocity of feeling evinced
between landlord and tenant. Returning
home, the host and his
daughters prepared to receive their unexpected
guests, the greater number
of whom were to assemble that evening.
Our “prosaic-minded” friend
here interposed a characteristic comment,
in these words: “When the
influx of guests took place about
six o’clock that same evening, you
may conceive the feelings of the
‘family aunt’ descending the stairs
before dinner, as if one of the pictures
had stepped out of its frame to
mix in such a crowd of strangers, for
such are almost all to me!” As the
drawing-rooms were dismantled in
preparation for the ball, there was
only the oak corridor to sit in, and it
must be confessed it required some
tact to find seats; whilst, of course,
all the men crowded together, English
fashion, under the staircase!
Capt. W&mdash;&mdash; acquired the name of
“master of the ceremonies,” as he
and E&mdash;&mdash; (one of our young hostesses)
drew up the order of march
to dinner, and he was deputed to
tell every one who to take&mdash;rather
puzzling in an assemblage scarcely
one of whom he had ever seen before.
The “weighty” matter of
English precedence in such a company
is more important than any one
would suppose; and we cannot wonder
that such social punctiliousness
should raise a smile among people
of simpler though not less generous
habits.</p>

<p>The dinner was a most elaborate
affair; indeed, in England, it is always
the crowning portion of any
entertainment, and the test of a
genuine social success. The table
looked beautiful with the massive
silver plate: the épergne representing
a herd of stags (the white stag
is Lord G&mdash;&mdash;’s crest) feeding under
a spreading oak; the vases of classical
shape, formerly wine-coolers, but
now, more congenially to modern refinement,
filled with ferns or plants
of colored foliage, contrasting with
the frosted silver; flowers and fruit
in utopian abundance, and every
vase or dish raised on a stand of
crimson velvet, in artistic relief
against the delicate white damask
of the table-cloth&mdash;and this, of
course, every day the same. Among
the guests we may pause a moment
to mention a lady of whom a stranger
to her gave this characteristic
description: saying that she was
nicely but quietly dressed, had large,
soft eyes, an intelligent expression,
and a thoughtful look. She was
certainly the most interesting and
the cleverest person of the company,
if the inward history of a mind is to
count more than its outward covering.
Suffice it to say that a few of
those present knew how to appreciate
her, especially a clergyman of
the neighborhood noted for his historical
researches and antiquarian learning&mdash;the
Rev. G. H. Hill. Among
those whom social reticence does
not forbid us to distinguish by name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
was also an architect of rare merit,
under whose supervision part of the
building had been erected&mdash;a man
whose mind is thoroughly artistic,
and whose name, already the property
of the public, we need therefore
not hesitate to give&mdash;Mr. C. Buckler.
His testimony, characteristic as
it must be, will not be inappropriate
in this sketch; of the whole festival
he could say with truth, as he did in
a charming letter to his patron and
host, that it was thoroughly mediæval
in spirit. This is high praise in
the mouth of an Englishman and
an artist; for our national pride is
inseparably woven with feudal and
ancestral feelings, an admiration for
the open-handed generosity and lavish
display of baronial times&mdash;for
everything, in a word, that made
England a fit nurse for Shakespeare,
and an ideal for Washington Irving.</p>

<p>If our readers are not weary of
pen-portraits, here is one&mdash;that of
the daughter of the lady we have
just spoken of, which our dear old
friend, the “often-quoted,” thus incisively
draws: “She is a pretty little
thing, with a very white skin, delicate
wild-rose color, and very bright
and large eyes, and as much as possible
keeping close to her mother’s
side, but evidently fond of dancing,
and enjoying everything with perfect
freshness.” We are pleased to
notice here that this type of the
English girl is not so defunct as
some pessimists would have us believe,
and that, despite paint and
fastness, and the clumsy imitation
of Parisian vice, there is yet in store
for the future a generation of homeloving
wives and mothers. Of another
of the near relations of the
host, our friend says: “It suffices to
mention Lady L&mdash;&mdash;’s name to express
all that is bright, and kind, and
good; her presence was a charm,
but she was obliged to go away after
two days, and it was a blank not to
see her.”</p>

<p>This woman, whose social charm
is so irresistible, is none the less a
generous and devoted attendant on
a husband whose mind had given
way, and whose health was more
than precarious; it was his comfort,
indeed, which was the cause of her
short stay in the house of rejoicing.</p>

<p>The great charm of this thoroughly
pleasant gathering was that there
were no “grand people,” no “fashionable
people,” no “fast people”;
that all were natural and real, and
everybody seemed pleased and happy.
But our “prosaic” friend actually
was not satisfied, and complained
gently of the disappointment,
among so many young people, of
not being able to idealize any incipient
romance; for, she queried,
“would it not have thrown a charm
of poetry over the whole thing?”</p>

<p>No, truly, although the thought is
touching and pretty; for, after all,
the fairest ideal of love could not
live in a crowd, and the love we
read of in Elizabethan records was
more courtly than deep, more gallant
than true. Love is an angel,
not a Cupid.</p>

<p>One evening, there was a ball for
the county families, many of whose
houses were filled with their own
circle of friends, all of whom were
included in the invitations. The
rooms looked gay and brilliant; toilets
were resplendent, and the family
pictures, with which the walls
were literally covered, gazed down
on an assemblage almost as bright
as their own. In the hall was a
white stuffed stag, with hoofs and
antlers gilt, representing in life-size
the family crest. The next morning,
breakfast <i>began</i> at the usual hour
(ten), but few appeared; but, by two
o’clock, they gradually stole down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span>
when tea and coffee had given
place to luncheon. Wednesday evening,
there was the servants’ ball.
Every one went into the large tent,
which made a splendid ball-room.
The dancing was rather amusing to
watch, for it was not the <i>forte</i> of the
assemblage; but they all looked very
happy, and the dignity of their manners
to each other was quite edifying!
Still, we thought it a great
shame to criticise. Thursday, there
was the feast for other and nearer
villages, Exton, Barrow, and Cottesmore,
with games before the people
sat down. And it was a goodly sight
when all the tables were peopled; all
the men at dinner, and all the women
and children at tea. Lord G&mdash;&mdash;’s
health was drunk first. It was the first
occasion on which he had to speak,
and it utterly overcame him; for he
alluded to the former time when they
had all been thus assembled to welcome
him to E&mdash;&mdash; on his accession
to the title. But the warmth and heartiness
with which his few words were
received must surely have pleased
him. Then they drank his son’s
health, to which toast the young
man responded modestly and well.
Later on in the evening, there were
beautiful fireworks, which lit up the
whole place most gorgeously.</p>

<p>Fireworks are not a specialty with
Englishmen, but on this occasion
they really went off to the credit of
all concerned. The host has had
long experience in such things in
Italy, where the merest village can
shame London itself on this head.
The clusters of Chinese lanterns
among the trees bordering the drives,
the Bengal lights shooting up in
fitful illuminations across the broken
front of the church tower and the
old Hall, the steadier lamps along
the lines of the house itself, and the
reflection of all in the many little
lakes within the grounds, made the
display peculiarly attractive. Every
one enjoyed it to the uttermost.</p>

<p>Friday, the 20th of October, the
heir’s birthday, was <i>the</i> day, <i>par excellence</i>.
And here we are reminded
that we are among those who have
returned to the faith of old England,
and have brought back to the
original giver of the great free institutions
of the country&mdash;the Catholic
Church&mdash;all the gifts of intellect, education,
culture, and learning drawn
from her alienated universities and
the polished influence of her errant
sons. A solemn High Mass, with
appropriate ecclesiastical music, was
the first interest that gathered the
guests together. Many not of our
faith were there, joining reverently,
and as far as they could, in the beautiful
service; the domestic chapel,
almost in size a church, looked very
fair in the pale morning light that
streamed through its pointed windows;
the shadows of the beech-leaves,
turning to brown and gold,
were thrown fitfully across the Lady
Chapel, against whose outside walls
the great tree almost leans; bars of
dusky golden light lay on the stone
floor of the memorial chapel, where
the foundress sleeps; and, as the
white-robed choristers and acolytes
moved softly to and fro in the deep
choir, the beautiful contrast seemed
to force itself upon one’s imagination
between them and the worshippers
in the nave, clad in dark, quiet draperies,
and massed together in shadowy
corners&mdash;typifying so delicately
the restful life of the future, and
the toiling watch still to be kept in
the present. From this, the most
congenial and appropriate scene we
had yet witnessed, we turned regretfully
to the new pleasures of the day.
The first event was very momentous,
and was marked by great state, being
no less than the presentation of
a silver inkstand to the young hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
of the <i>fête</i>, Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, from the
servants. All the household was
drawn up at one end of the entrance-tent.
Poor good Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;, the
housekeeper, whom nearly twenty
years’ service had made a mother to
the host’s children, was quite unable
to restrain her tears, while behind
the large round table, with the inkstand
on it, stood J&mdash;&mdash;, the butler,
<i>pale</i> with the responsibility of his
coming speech. Lord C&mdash;&mdash; stood
opposite, with the family and guests
behind him. This was the most
touching scene of all, but none the
less the most formidable ceremony.
The presentation was very creditably
made, and as gracefully acknowledged,
to the equal satisfaction of all
parties; and, among the birthday
gifts, none was so valued by the recipient.
He had grown up among
these old friends; the few who had
not known him as a boy had heard
the tales of his childhood, and experienced
the kindness of his manner.
All felt as if he belonged to
them, and as though his interests
were theirs. This feeling, too, is one
of the relics of the past fast disappearing
from the heartless fabric of
modern society; and it is pleasant
to see traces of it yet left here and
there in the ancient baronial households
of England.</p>

<p>The concluding festivity was on a
gigantic scale, and proved the most
characteristic of any. This was the
grand ball and supper to the tenants,
which furnished the local newspapers
with materials for rapturous descriptions
and complimentary “leaders”
for at least a week afterwards. The
entrance tent was lined with the officers
of the yeomanry in full uniform
(scarlet), to the number of eighteen
or twenty; the band of their regiment
was also in attendance, and the land-steward,
to whose management much
had been entrusted, introduced each
party of the tenants as they arrived.
Nearly five hundred of these characteristic
guests were soon assembled,
Lord G&mdash;&mdash;, his daughters, and two
sons dancing in turn with all the
most prominent of them. The ball
opened with a country-dance; not the
formal quadrille, but the hearty, old-fashioned
performance, in which the
elderly and heavy are as comfortably
at home as the young and the supple.
The ball, however, brilliant as it was,
was but secondary to the supper,
which was the crowning-point of the
week’s doings&mdash;the occasion, long
looked forward to, of pleasant and
witty speeches, of hearty good-will,
and of manifestations of real and substantial
friendship. To borrow the
words of a weekly of the neighborhood,
the Lincolnshire <i>Chronicle</i>:
“At one o’clock, supper was served in
the marquee, which, tastefully decorated,
brilliantly lighted, and filled
with the gaily attired company, presented
a scene which will not soon
be forgotten by those who had the
pleasure of witnessing it. The yeomanry
band played ‘The Roast
Beef of Old England’ as the party
glided into the tent, and, when all had
taken their places, grace was said.
With the exception of a buck roasted
whole and sent to table with gilt
antlers, the whole of the viands were
cold, the <i>pièce de résistance</i> being a
splendid baron of beef. The birthday
cake occupied a prominent position
at a centre table, and among
other novelties was a fine peacock in
full plumage. Just before the toast
of the evening was given, the beautiful
present of plate purchased by the
tenantry was carried in and placed in
front of the young Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, on
the principal table.” “When all were
seated,” says another local paper,
“the <i>coup d’œil</i>, from the entrance
of the tent, was very striking; the gay
uniforms of the yeomanry, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
dresses of the ladies, combined with
the colored lining of the tent, the
numerous flags and banners, and
the innumerable chandeliers filled
with wax candles, presenting a
very brilliant effect. The Earl of
G&mdash;&mdash; and his distinguished visitors
were seated at a long raised table
facing the guests of the evening, and
immediately in front of him were two
other raised tables, upon one of which
was a baron of beef weighing between
30 and 40 stone, and a whole
roasted buck. There were also 21
joints of roast beef, 15 of pressed
beef, 17 galantines of veal, 24 game
pies, 14 large hams, 28 tongues, 15
turkeys, 8 boars’ heads, 15 rounds
of beef, 10 legs and 14 shoulders of
mutton, 72 roast fowls, 54 pheasants,
62 partridges, 20 plum-puddings, etc.
etc., making a total of 1,000 dishes.”</p>

<p>The speeches being the great
characteristic incident of the feast, we
will quote some parts of them, showing
in their simple energy how close
the ties of friendship still are between
the owner and the tiller of the soil.
Some of the speakers were farmers,
most of them prosperous and pushing
men. We take our quotations
from the Lincolnshire <i>Chronicle</i>:
“Mr. Berridge proposed the health
of the Earl of G&mdash;&mdash; as a nobleman,
a neighbor, and a friend.... The
noble earl had inherited from his
ancestors that military blood which
always ran through the veins of the
N&mdash;&mdash;ls [the family name of Lord
G&mdash;&mdash;]. If they looked round these
halls, they would see the portrait of
many an old warrior.... He understood
Lord C&mdash;&mdash; now belonged to
the army, and he would express a
wish that that young nobleman
might one day be commander-in-chief
of England (cheers). Speaking
of the family, he was reminded
of an anecdote. A friend of his was
taking a drive through the lanes in
the neighborhood of this house, when
he came in view of the mansion, and
said to an old laborer he met on the
road: ‘Who lives here, my man?’
‘Lord G&mdash;&mdash;,’ was the reply. ‘Is
it an old family?’ was the next inquiry.
‘They came here, sir, before
the Flood,’ was the response (laughter
and cheers).”</p>

<p>This <i>naïveté</i> of the old man reminds
one of the proud boast of
some old French family, that they had
an ark of their own at the time of the
Flood, and were quite independent
of Noe and his ship of refuge!</p>

<p>Lord G&mdash;&mdash;, in his earnest reply,
gracefully alluded in the following
words to the long tenure of land by
the farmers’ ancestors: “There can
be nothing more gratifying than the
existence of cordial good feeling
between the occupiers of land and
their landlords; and there can be no
better evidence of this happy state
of things than to find, upon reference
to records of the past, numbers of
families living upon the same estate
for generations&mdash;for a longer time,
perhaps, than the owners of the estate
themselves (hear, hear). I
believe there are many people here
whose ancestors have been for centuries
upon this property; and one can
only hope that the same families,
from father to son, may continue here
for centuries hereafter, and that what
has happened in years past will be
repeated in years to come, so that,
by your descendants and the descendants
of my son a long time
hence, the same mutual good feeling
may be evinced and similar occurrences
be witnessed as these we
celebrate this evening.”</p>

<p>Lord D&mdash;&mdash;, an early friend of the
host, proposed the health of the
young recipient of the day’s honors.
His speech, quite the best of all, is
worthy of notice. After a very apt
and graceful beginning, he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
“I am speaking to tenant-farmers
and breeders of stock, and you know
that, when you look upon a young
animal, you always inquire after his
sire&mdash;what he came from (laughter
and cheers); and you judge, from
what has been, what will be (renewed
cheering). But you know
what the N&mdash;&mdash;s are&mdash;what their
stock is (great cheering). They
have lived in this country among
you and before your eyes for generations.
You know they are a family
who love to live among their own.
They prefer spending their money
among their own people, and sharing
their interests, to going abroad, as so
many others do, and spending their
money away. Unfortunately, it is
not uncommon, in speaking of a man,
to say how few vices he has, and not
how many virtues; and many a time
I have heard it said, when there
were no virtues to speak of, ‘Well, he
is a good-natured fellow.’” He then
warmly eulogized his young friend,
whom he had known “ever since he
could crawl,” and ended by wishing
that he might be a worthy “chip off
the old block.” Then, with well-deserved
praise, he spoke thus of the
father:</p>

<p>“For I will say this of the father,
whom I have known most intimately
for the last twenty years: that he is
one of whom it may be truly said, in
the full meaning of the word, he is a
‘just man’ (hear, hear), and I hope
his son will walk in his footsteps.
May all health and happiness accompany
him through life, and, when his
time is up, and he is called away
from this world, may he leave a
memory behind him as of one who
lived blessing and blessed, and may
he be handed down to posterity as
one who did his duty to God and
man!”</p>

<p>Mr. Wortley&mdash;another principal
tenant, and the orator of his neighborhood,
a man whose kind heart is father
to his innocent pride of speech&mdash;then
stood forward on behalf of the
committee who had managed the
subscriptions for the birthday gift,
and spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“My Lord C&mdash;&mdash;: I have now the
great pleasure and the distinguished
honor to ask your acceptance of this
plate, which is contributed by tenants
and friends of the Earl of G&mdash;&mdash; on
the occasion of your coming of age, as
a substantial evidence from us of the
cordial manner in which we share
the general joy of this day, and of
the great respect we entertain towards
your noble father and the family
of the N&mdash;&mdash;s.... It is given to
you, my lord, just stepping, as it were,
on the threshold of active and responsible
life, with the earnest wish
that you may be largely blest with
those talents for which so many of
your family have been celebrated,
and may, like them, enjoy the high
blessing of a disposition to use them,
as they have used theirs, for the
greater benefit and advantage of their
fellow-creatures.” Then making his
favorite quotation, one largely used
on these occasions as strikingly appropriate,
he repeated sonorously the
well-known lines:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Kind words are more than coronets,<br />
And simple faith than Norman blood.”</p>

<p class="p1">“And still,” he went on, “we, the
living, have what past generations
could point to&mdash;the bright coronet
of old N&mdash;&mdash;l blood to boast of,
and their natural crest of real and
crowning charity to be thankful for
(cheers).”</p>

<p>The presentation plate was a beautiful
silver épergne, also convertible into
candelabra, thirty-nine inches high,
and a pair of flower-stands with finely
modelled figures of a stag and a doe
standing beneath an oak. According
to the universal custom in country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
neighborhoods, these costly articles
were not procured from London,
but from some local silversmith of
good standing; for in England everything
like centralization is instinctively
avoided. How much the
prosperity of every part of the kingdom
is thereby increased may be
seen at a glance. Mr. Wortley concluded
with these words: “It is
not presented with the power of
words, but it comes with the far
stronger power of hearts within and
without this gorgeous assemblage&mdash;warm,
devoted, and glowing hearts&mdash;hearts
joining with yours, my Lord
C&mdash;&mdash;, in wishing that you may
long remain the heir to the title
and estate; while we join most sincerely
with each other in the fervent
hope and humble prayer that
through life, in whatever clime or
condition, God’s blessing may be
your unfailing portion (cheers).”</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash; made a modest and
graceful acknowledgment in a few
well-chosen words, telling his guests
“what a value he should always set
on the testimonial as a remembrance
of the happy hours he and they had
been permitted to enjoy together”
and begging them “to take what he
had said for what it was worth.” “I
do not say this by way of any excuse
for what I am certain must be my
shortcomings, but I say it lest you
should think I am expressing myself
in any way too feebly, or with too
little warmth of feeling.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson (another tenant)
proposed the brother and sisters
of Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, and the younger
branches of the family. He said facetiously
enough: “Experience has probably
taught all of us that it is rather
a misfortune that there should be an
only child in a family, and that there
is very apt to be in this case a spoiled
urchin on one side, and not at all
unlikely two silly parents on the
other.” Of course, this produced
laughter, and the speaker went on in
the same strain, till he remarked
finally that he sincerely hoped “not
only that there would always be an
heir to the N&mdash;&mdash;l family, but
younger branches also.”</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash;’s younger brother answered
quite as well as he had been
addressed: “I was not prepared to
speak to you on the present occasion.
I was flattering myself I
should get through the whole of
these proceedings without having to
pass through this ordeal.... As
younger branches, we grow out further
and further from the parent
stem, until we are at length lost
among the other trees of the forest,
while the other and older branch
continues to tower upwards.”</p>

<p>A speaker, whom we cannot resist
designating by a synonyme which is
no longer a disguise, “Lothair,” and
who shared these festivities, proposed
“the ladies” in a humorous speech,
beyond which we must make no further
quotations. “Somebody,” he
remarked, “in speaking of these festivities,
has said that this entertainment
had some peculiar features
distinguishing it from other entertainments
of its kind; as, for instance,
it is now half-past three in the morning,
instead of about five or six in
the afternoon (laughter). It has also
this peculiar feature, ... that it is
not confined to a lugubrious class of
men in black, talking nonsense about
the army, navy, militia, and volunteers
(renewed laughter). Here we
have a few toasts brought in as
an interlude in the middle of an
entertainment of which it may be
said, ‘It is not good for man to be
alone,’ whatever Mr. Spurgeon may
have observed to the contrary.”</p>

<p>The speaker has since been the
subject of an ovation fully as demonstrative
as that in which he took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
secondary part last October, and we
may hope that, in years to come,
Cardiff may rival Rutland in the
mediæval character of its princely
entertainments.</p>

<p>The birthday cake was home-made,
and a <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of the family
housekeeper. Its weight was 120
lbs., and its structure four tiers of
confectionery, displaying medallions
of the arms and crest of the family;
the silk banner (besides many smaller
flags) surmounting it bearing the
name and date of birth of Lord
C&mdash;&mdash;. Never, indeed, could there
have been more gratifying feelings
manifested, and never could a series of
the kindest hospitalities have passed
off with more perfect satisfaction.
Throughout the whole week there
was nothing but good feeling, every
one vying with each other to do the
utmost to make all succeed. Not a
<i>contretemps</i> occurred&mdash;all as Lord
G&mdash;&mdash; could have wished, and so
well deserves it should be. There
were most regretful faces the next
day, when, after breakfast, the time
of parting came; all, we believe,
heartily wishing it could begin again.</p>

<p>This sketch, which to us has all
the personal attraction of a family
record, may perhaps not be uninteresting
to some descendants of those
old English families, who are as worthily
represented on this side of the
Atlantic as they are in the mother
country.</p>

<p>The poetry of the olden times has
not yet quite departed from the feudal
soil of England; and, in these
meetings of true friendship between
two of the most powerful classes of
the country, we may read a promise
of a common cause being made by
their united influence against the
sickening aggression of insensate
communism, and the spread of licentious
ideas. In this all good men
and true, whether of Old or New
England, are heartily agreed. But
what strikes us even more is the
beautiful picture here displayed of
the revived spirit of the olden faith,
quickening the pulses, guiding the
lives, and hallowing the pleasures of
a new generation of Englishmen.
Here are the senators, the lawgivers,
the soldiers of the future, assembled
under the auspices of the old church,
putting into generous practice her ideas
of ample hospitality and unquestioning
charity; here are England’s best
men bowing like happy children to the
customs and the influence of the faith
brought to them by Augustine and
Wilfrid; here is the church represented
by the best blood and the
most chivalrous class of England’s
sons, who take their place and raise
their voice to-day in society, in the
courts, and in the senate, with a fearlessness
and a freedom which a hundred
years ago would have cost them
their heads! The Catholic Church
stands now in a proud and high position,
a social conqueror on the same
soil which she conquered once already
by the splendor of her learning,
and the resources of her material
energy. The lands her monks
reclaimed from barrenness, the universities
her friars adorned with their
matchless genius, after having been
torn from her by violence, are virtually
holding out their arms to her
again, and the Gothic chapels that
crown the abbey demesnes of new
and wealthy converts are but the
practical translation of that better
wealth poured back into her bosom
by the converts of the schools and
universities. In England, more than
in any other land, the Christian may
exclaim in triumph: <i>Christus regnat,
Christus imperat</i>, and, for the encouragement
of the future, may confidently
point to the records of the
past, and say with Constantine: <i>In
hoc signo vinces.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><i>The Expressions of the Emotions in
Man and Animals</i> is the title of the
latest work written by Charles Darwin.
This author has already gained
a pretty widespread name by his
two volumes on the <i>Descent of Man</i>,
and on <i>The Origin of Species</i>. In all
these, he advocates the theory of
only one parent and progenitor, common
both to man and to the animal.</p>

<p>Man is the offspring of the brute.
The only distinction between them
is that of a more perfect development.
Man is a monkey perfectly
developed. This developing process
is no other than habit transmitted,
imitation, and practice.</p>

<p>This theory is supposed in the
volume before us&mdash;<i>The Expressions</i>,
etc. It is, indeed, taken for granted,
and Mr. Darwin merely seeks confirmatory
proofs in this work. How
he does so we shall see.</p>

<p>The reasoning of the entire volume
may be summed up in the following
syllogism: The expressions of the
emotions in man and animals are,
for the most part, similar, nay, alike.
Now, this could not be so, did man
not descend from the animal; therefore,
man is the offspring of the brute.</p>

<p>Of course, he will have to admit
some accidental differences in the
expressions of each. But these he
easily gets over by saying that in
man those external expressions of
the emotions are already perfected,
matured, and developed, while in
animals they are as yet budding,
developing, and perfecting.</p>

<p>The principle of evolution would
seem to account for all differences.
The animal, by evolving its faculties
in a long series of years, rises gradually
to a higher species, and finally,
having walked on all fours, comes to
the conclusion it would be better and
more sensible to use only two feet.
Having looked downward for a long
time, it begins to think it would be
more honorable and decent to assume
an upright posture. And then,
grunting and howling are by no
means as becoming as speaking
French, or Italian, or Chinese; hence,
Mr. Orang comes to the conclusion
that he has been silent long enough,
and that it is time that he, too, should
have his say about matters.</p>

<p>We do not say that this is all expressed
in so many words in the volume
before us. Oh! no; Mr. Darwin
is too adroit to do that. Like
the devil, he sometimes assumes the
garment of light, and puts on an
appearance of virtue. His words
are characterized by a tone of modesty
and humility and even diffidence
which is not common to that
class of writers. He does not directly
affirm anything; but he asks questions
that contain a negative answer.
He insinuates. He does not tell us
man is a monkey, but he affirms that
man expresses his feelings in the
same manner as do these animals.
Hence how explain this similarity, if
they be not brothers?</p>

<p>We call attention to this fact. It
alone can render his work dangerous
to youthful or unguarded minds.
We think there is little to fear that
its frivolous arguments will excite
anything but laughter and ridicule
among men of solid erudition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ideas embodied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
in this book are the creed of many
enlightened persons, even, of this
“progressive” age. This alone accounts
for the favor and widespread
circulation Darwin’s writings have
acquired. Protestantism has done its
work only too well. Casting off all
authority in matters of faith, it has
paved the way to all errors, and its
theory has merely been developed
by our modern materialists.</p>

<p>We are not disposed to deny the
great labor and varied research employed
in the work before us; but,
we must say, seldom has it been our
lot to witness such shallowness of
argument, such loose connection between
premises and conclusions. It
will astonish the intelligent reader
that so earnest a student as Mr. Darwin
evidently is, could make use of
logic in a manner discreditable to
any tyro.</p>

<p>But we must not wonder at this.
The drunkard sees things turning
topsy-turvy, when in reality they
stand still. One who wears green
spectacles will behold objects in a
green or pale color. We are apt to
judge things according to preconceived
ideas or a certain state of
mind. So Mr. Darwin: his great
hobby is to make man a monkey,
and <i>vice versa</i>. Hence, he takes
slight resemblances between the two
as certain proof of his theory. Thus,
he says: “With mankind, some expressions,
such as the bristling of the
hair under the influence of extreme
terror, can hardly be understood except
on the belief that man once existed
in a much lower and animal-like
condition. The community of
certain expressions in distinct though
allied species, as in the movements
of the same facial muscles during
laughter by man and by various
monkeys, is rendered somewhat more
intelligible if we believe in their
common progenitor. He who admits
on general principles that the
structure and habits of all animals
have been gradually evolved, will
look at the whole subject of expressions
in a new and interesting light.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>This language is clear and unmistakable,
though its meaning be artfully
disguised. The logic of his
conclusions, however, is not equally
satisfactory. Why trace man’s origin
to the monkey, because, forsooth, his
hair bristles when angry? Or is it
really so necessary to make man a
brute because the same facial muscles
move during laughter? We had
always thought that these accidental
resemblances were more than sufficiently
explained by the simple fact
that man, besides his immortal soul,
is possessed of a body also, which,
being material, is subject in many
respects to the laws of other animals.
We say, in fact, man is a rational
animal. He is composed of
matter and spirit. As regards his
body, he is subject to the same laws
as those which regulate animals.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin has in his conclusions
what is not contained in his premises,
and hence he falls into a grave error
in regard to the first principles of
logic and sound reasoning. It is
quite logical and perfectly true to
say man has some exterior or bodily
motions and expressions similar to
those of other animals, and therefore
that his bodily organs have some relation
and similarity with those of
the lower animals; nay, we may even
infer the same essence to be common
to the bodily organs of both. Thus
much strict logic will allow. Thus
much sound philosophy has always
admitted. But then, we may ask,
How far does this resemblance extend?
Does it merely exist in the
bodily organs, or does it perhaps
show itself in all external actions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
even those of the intellect and the
will? Does it extend to all the essential
elements in both, or is it merely
accidental, relating simply to minor
actions? The answer cannot be
doubtful even to the most superficial
observer. We ask, therefore, Is this
resemblance of an essential, or rather
an accidental, character? We can
only admit that the latter is the case.
There is, it is true, a manifold similarity;
but after all, even where this
is most striking, is there not a vast
discrepancy? With the lower animal,
all is routine&mdash;machine-like, habitual,
ever the same under similar
circumstances, nor can it combine
means with the end. In man, these
same external actions are regulated
by the will, and can be omitted or
done at pleasure.</p>

<p>Now, will Mr. Darwin say this is
merely a trifle&mdash;that this, too, can
be acquired by the brute after a long
experience and a lapse of years?
Reason and sound philosophy teach
that the sensations of brutes are
essentially distinct from, and in nowise
contain, reason or intelligence.
How, then, could reason be the product
of evolution? How, then, can
that be evolved which does not at
all exist?</p>

<p>We repeat it: Darwin’s conclusion
is similar to this: “A dog is a cat,
because, forsooth, both sleep.” He
finds in man and brutes some partial
similarities in mere external actions,
and straightway he concludes that
they are both of the same essence
and parentage. As well might he
say burning lamps are emanations
from the sun, because they, too, give
light.</p>

<p>Instinct is almost entirely left out
of account, and all expressions and
external actions are attributed solely
to habit and exercise repeated.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> We
by no means doubt that habit and
exercise have a great deal to do with
external actions. But can they all
be accounted for in such a manner?
When we ask, How do children, from
the very first day of their birth, make
use of their hands and feet, and employ
their mouths in the proper way
for imbibing nourishment? Mr. Darwin
may answer: “This habit, too,
was transmitted from parent to offspring,
and indicates a long series of
generations” (p. 39).</p>

<p>But we cannot very well see how
this answer will satisfy even the most
credulous reader. Habits may be to
a certain extent transmitted by parents
to their children; but generally
it is, in an imperfect state, the
“tendency” or inclination, rather
than the act, that is transmitted.
An intemperate parent may transmit
to his offspring a “tendency” to that
vice; but we have not yet heard of a
born drunkard.</p>

<p>Moreover, is this principle applicable
in a general manner even in
regard to merely accidental habits?
Experience tells us quite the contrary.</p>

<p>Weak-minded parents often give
birth to most gifted children. On
the contrary, many most cultivated
and intelligent parents have children
who are dull and slow of understanding.</p>

<p>But even granting that habits may
be transmitted from parent to offspring,
we ask, What is the nature
of such habits? Are they essential
elements of nature, or merely minor
and trifling motions? Mr. Darwin’s
own example on the point will confirm
our assertion that they are of
the latter sort: “A gentleman of
considerable position was found by
his wife to have the curious trick,
when he lay fast asleep on his back
in bed, of raising his right arm slowly
in front of his face up to his forehead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
and then dropping it with a
jerk, so that the wrist fell heavily on
the bridge of his nose. The trick
did not occur every night, but occasionally,
and was independent of any
ascertained cause. Sometimes it was
repeated incessantly for an hour or
more. The gentleman’s nose was
prominent, and its bridge often became
sore from the blows which it
received” (p. 34). His son, too, inherited
this trick. The only difference,
however, consisted in the son’s
nose not being quite so prominent,
and therefore less exposed to the
tricky and mysterious blows.</p>

<p>Now, what does a fact of this sort
prove? Simply that slight, bodily
actions, such as the one alleged, can
be transmitted.</p>

<p>“Language,” he tells us, “has
been invented by man in a slow
and tedious process, completed by
innumerable steps half consciously
made” (p. 60). It is somewhat
amusing to listen to his description
of this process of inventing language.
“The sexes,” he says, “of many animals
call for each other during the
breeding season, etc. This, indeed,
seems to have been the primordial
use and means of development of
voice” (p. 84).</p>

<p>As an example, he alleges the cow
calling for her calf, the ewes bleating
for their lambs (p. 85). This theory
is at least amusing, if not clear and
convincing. It only adds another
specimen of Mr. Darwin’s loose
logic. His argument can be thus
presented: There is a resemblance
between the sound of a cow calling
for her calf and the voice of man;
therefore, the latter is derived from
the former, being merely its development&mdash;they
are both identical in
germ. The one is perfected by the
principle of evolution, which has the
wonderful capacity of transforming
all sorts of things.</p>

<p>This is truly making light of that
noble gift bestowed upon man by
his Creator&mdash;language. But, ingenious
as Mr. Darwin strives to be in
assigning the origin of language, he
overlooks two little points. Language
he confounds, first, with mere
inarticulate sounds. Secondly, he
forgets that there may be a distinction
between the sound or voice as a
sign of an idea or of a mere sensation.
To confound the two would
be like comparing the tones of a
piano, as produced by the hands of
an artist, to the same sounds brought
forth by some monkey trying his
paws on the instrument.</p>

<p>We do not know whether Mr. Darwin
has much of a musical ear. If he
has, even in a very slight degree, we
think he would soon find a very
great and specific distinction between
the production of the musician and
the jargon of the monkey. He
would tell us, in the one case, the
sounds are expressive of the musical
combination and ideas of the artist,
while, in the other, they are mere
unmeaning sounds. So it is with
language. Words express ideas. We
can use them as we choose, nay,
even wilfully change or disguise their
true meaning. What similarity exists,
then, between language and the
sounds of animals? If any, it is in
the sound. Does this justify the
conclusion that they are both identical
in germ; that the one is a development
of the other? As well
might we say the whistling of the
wind among the leaves of trees, and
the howling of the storm, are identical
with the voice of man. All
these sounds of nature are no less
sounds than those of man and the
brute; but will any man of sound
mind identify them?</p>

<p>Still, Mr. Darwin goes on with
an air of perfect self-complacency:
“From this fact, and from the analogy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
of other animals, I have been led to
infer that the progenitors of man
probably uttered musical tones before
they had acquired the power of
articulate speech” (p. 87).</p>

<p>Of course, our progenitors here
are none other than monkeys. It is
quite apparent that Darwin’s notion
of language is extremely inadequate
and confused. He must allow us to
refresh his memory a little on the
subject. A word is an external sign
whereby an internal thought or idea
is made known to others, just as
smoke is a sign of fire. Still, words
are not expressive of ideas by any
natural aptitude. In fact words are
naturally so little adapted to express
any particular concept of the mind
that they may be distorted from
their meaning. They are conventional
signs: and except so far as they were
given to our first parents by God,
they have been adopted and used by
positive authority, custom, or agreement
to serve as a medium of
thought.</p>

<p>Herein lies one of the specific differences
of human speech from the
sound of animals. These give forth
sounds <i>naturally</i> adapted to express
some feeling. Moreover, their utterances
are not chosen by themselves,
but dictated by nature. They cannot
change them; while man selects,
varies, and changes his words at will.
Hence, language is defined: “The
articulate voice of man, having signification
by the agreement of men.”
Words are parts of a sentence, which is
defined: “An assemblage of words
intended to mean something.”</p>

<p>We here waive the question
whether language was invented by
man at all. Our doctrine is that it
was not invented, but was communicated
directly by God to our first
parents, Adam and Eve. But this
is of no importance at present; for,
whether invented by man, or directly
communicated by God, Mr. Darwin’s
theory is equally untenable.</p>

<p>We sum up the differences of
sound or language in man and in
animals as follows:</p>

<p>1. In man, language is the expression
of thought and judgment, while
the sounds of animals are merely spontaneous
and natural utterances.</p>

<p>2. Language in man is the product
of reasoning; it presupposes a perception
of the relation of the subject
and the predicate. For instance,
when I say, Man is immortal, I must
perceive the relation of the attribute
immortality to man. Now, the
sound of the animal is merely expressive
of some solitary feeling.</p>

<p>3. Man directs his words, while the
brute’s sound is ever the same.</p>

<p>Another instance of Darwin’s logic
is found in tracing the origin of the
expression of sulkiness in man, especially
in children. This feeling,
he says, is expressed by a protrusion
of the lips, or, as it is called, “making
a snout.” Now, he continues,
“young orangs and chimpanzees
protrude their lips to an extraordinary
degree, when they are discontented,
somewhat angry, or sulky”
(p. 234).</p>

<p>But, lo! what is his conclusion?
Therefore, he infers, this habit of
man was a primordial habit in his
“semi-human progenitors,” who are,
of course, no less than the aforesaid
honorable monkeys. Let us hear his
words: “If, then, our semi-human progenitors
[<i>i.e.</i> Messrs. Orang and Chimpanzee]
protruded their lips when
sulky or a little angered in the same
manner as do the existing anthropoid
apes, it is not an anomalous though
a curious fact that our children should
exhibit, when similarly affected, a
trace of the same expression” (p. 234).
Mr. Darwin is cunning. He wishes
tacitly to infer that man comes from
the animal, because both can make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
“snouts.” Of course, even he must
concede that the monkey can make
a better or at least a longer “snout”
than man. And hence the principles
of evolution in this case at least
would imply retrogression, not progress.
His mode of reasoning is
strange indeed. When he finds an
expression in man, he searches
whether there is anything like it
among the monkeys or other animals;
and, when he has discovered even a
slight trace, he triumphantly exclaims,
Behold the progenitors of man! He
does not yet call them genitors; they
are not the immediate parents, but
simply grandfathers and grandmothers.
Nor are these progenitors
quite human; they are as yet semi-human,
being about half-way between
the monkey phase and that
of man. Speaking of man, he says:
“The lips are sometimes protruded
during rage in a manner the meaning
of which I do not understand,
unless it depends on our descent
from some ape-like animal” (p. 243).
Mr. Darwin manifests a strange partiality
for the ape-like animals.</p>

<p>But it is no wonder he cannot
understand the plainest facts, which
every Catholic child can tell him.
He sets aside all revealed truths.
He knows nothing about the simple
but sublime narrative in the first
chapter of Genesis. He ignores the
creative act bringing forth, not one
kind, but “the living creature in its
kind, cattle, and creeping things, and
beasts of the earth according to their
kinds.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> To him, this is of no meaning.
True, the Scripture records the
solemn creation of man as entirely
distinct from that of animals. “Let
us make man,” God said, “to our
image, and likeness; and let him
have dominion over the fishes of the
sea, and the fowls of the air,” etc.
“And God created man to his own
image: to the image of God he created
him, male and female he created
them.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> True, Darwin will say,
according to the Scripture, “God
breathed into his [man’s] face the
breath of life, and man became a
living soul.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>But what care I for the Scriptures,
when my own private and infallible
reason leads me to think that God
did not directly breathe into man
an intelligent soul&mdash;made after God’s
own image and likeness&mdash;but rather
that man received it from the animal?
Such is, indeed, the result of
the revolt of reason against God.
Like Satan, who was cast from
heaven in a moment, when desirous
of elevating his throne to a level
with that of God, so man falls and
degrades himself when he becomes
too proud to listen to God’s Word,
making reason the supreme and
sole criterion of truth and certitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin seems to admit a
Creator of the universe, but holds
that only one, or at most four, species
were created. Now, we must not
forget, as he certainly does, that
the Creator was an infinitely intelligent
being, and therefore had some
object in view in creation. Every
intelligent being must act for some
end. We call him a fool who
knows not what he is doing, and
therefore is foolish. Hence, in creation,
God destined each creature
for some end, to accomplish a certain
task. The Creator must, however,
give to each creature the necessary
means to attain its end. It
would be unintelligible that God
should destine me to walk, without
giving me feet; or create me to earn
my livelihood by the labor of my
hands, without giving me hands to
work with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this principle, so universally
exhibited in nature, will easily and
satisfactorily explain all expressions
in animals as well as in man, without
obliging us to have recourse to
the monkey theory so fondly adhered
to by Darwin.</p>

<p>We come now to another proof
adduced by Darwin to establish his
beloved ape-descending theory. It
is taken from the state of an insane
person (p. 245). We will allow him
to speak for himself: “Its symptoms
are the reappearance of primitive
instincts, a faint echo from a far
distant past, testifying to a kinship
which man has almost outgrown”
(p. 245). These are the words of Dr.
Maudsley, cited and approved by
him. The state of insanity in man
is compared to the normal state of the
animal. Again, he asks, “Why should
a human being, deprived of his reason,
ever become so brutal in character
as some do, unless he has the
brutal nature within him?” (p. 246).</p>

<p>A more silly or childish mode of
reasoning could scarcely be thought
of. As well might he say the sun
returns to its primitive state when in
an eclipse, or an engine is working
properly when the boilers explode
and spread death and consternation
all around.</p>

<p>We say of the idiot, He has lost his
mind. Not that it really is entirely
extinct: it is merely out of working
order. Its clearness is darkened by
some disorder. The idiot is in a
state repugnant to his natural condition.
How, then, infer from such a
condition a former kinship? A machine
or clock out of order will, when
left to itself, work indeed; not, however,
returning to its normal state,
but destroying itself. So it is with
the idiot. It was, therefore, perhaps
rather superfluous for Mr. Darwin to
spend so much time and labor, and
give his readers so much trouble, for
the sake of finding out in how many
ways idiots resemble his dear monkeys,
chimpanzees, and orangs.</p>

<p>We wonder why the case of Nabuchodonosor
did not occur to him.
It would have so well illustrated his
theory. For he, without becoming
permanently an idiot, was seized with
an irresistible propensity to return,
as Mr. Darwin would say, to his own
brethren, and renew his old friendships
and acquaintances. And so
well was that gentleman pleased with
his company that he remained in it
not less than seven years, until it
pleased God to restore him to his
more intelligent and polite brothers.</p>

<p>We would suggest to Mr. Darwin
a similar experiment. He ought to
be sociable, and from time to time
imitate Nabuchodonosor: let his
hair and beard grow until they become
long feathers; his ears, too,
could be extended somewhat, and
the nails of his hands and feet might
very well become claws; he ought
also to eat grass for a while. Thus
he would be fulfilling a duty to his
rustic brethren, and he could at the
same time enlighten them a little on
bipedal civilization, especially as they
will one day get to be men themselves,
and therefore should try to do
honor to their future relatives.</p>

<p>Darwin may tenderly call monkeys
“our nearest allies” (p. 253), or say:
“The playful sneer or ferocious snarl
in man reveals his animal descent”
(p. 253); or again: “We may readily
believe, from our affinity to the anthropomorphous
apes, that our male
semi-human progenitors possessed
great canine teeth” (p. 253)&mdash;he
may say all this, and still, we fear, he
would not like to have himself introduced
at the court of London as the
brother of the long-tailed and widely
known orang-outang. And why?
Because his whole moral nature
would revolt at such an indignity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
and thus furnish the strongest proof,
perhaps, that all his talk about ape-affinity
and descent is nonsense.
Human nature rebels at such a degradation.
It protests instinctively
against such an alliance. It is unconscious
of such a relationship.</p>

<p>Now, how is it, otherwise, that our
nature is so tender with regard to
all kindred? How is it that brothers
and sisters and relatives love each
other so much and without effort; that
in all men there is a feeling of affinity
toward their fellows? How, we ask,
does our nature, otherwise so tenderly
inclined to all relatives, even
the most distant, forget in this one
instance alone a relationship at once
the most sacred and tender&mdash;that of
a child to its parent? For we, says
Mr. Darwin, are the grandchildren at
least of the animal.</p>

<p>All the materialistic cavils and
speculations of so-called philosophers
will suffer shipwreck on this
rock&mdash;the moral feeling of the dignity
and specific difference of man.
But we will explain the symptoms
of lunacy to Darwin in a direct
manner.</p>

<p>We grant that man has the brutish
“nature within him.” We do not
concede, however, that he has only
the brutish nature and no other.
Man has a soul as well as a body.
As regards the nature of the body,
we cheerfully grant all that Mr. Darwin
could desire. It is of the same
substance as that of his dear orang.
It has, moreover, the same violent
passions and downward tendencies;
nay, it can&mdash;as experience teaches
in fact it has&mdash;outdo the brute
in violent bursts of passion. It is,
moreover, regulated by the same laws
of climate, food, life, etc.</p>

<p>But this is all we concede. It has
not the same origin, being directly
created by God in its natural state.
Much less do we admit that man is
endowed with no higher nature, entirely
and specifically distinct from
his body. He has a soul that thinks&mdash;a
soul that is entirely spiritual and
intelligent, not merely sensible.</p>

<p>We therefore answer that the state
of idiots shows, indeed, that man has
the brutish nature within him, but by
no means that he has no other nature.
Only a little logic would have
shown Darwin that his conclusions
embody far more than his premises
will allow. It seems plain enough
that this simple truth is the key to
the fullest explanations of human
nature itself, and its similarities with
the nature of mere animals. Man
was defined by the ancients as “a
rational animal.” S. Thomas and
the scholastics took up and perpetuated
this definition. Man is an animal,
because he has a body like all
animals, and a soul which is created
to be the form of that body. Man is,
moreover, a rational being, because,
unlike all the other animals, he has a
soul which has a separate existence
of its own, is created immediately by
God, and is essentially spiritual.</p>

<p>This distinction, if only borne in
mind by our monkey theorists, would
have aided them not a little, we
opine, in their brain-cracking researches;
nor would they have found
so many mysteries where everything
is plain and intelligible.</p>

<p>We now proceed to another principle
advanced in the book before
us. Darwin says: “That the chief
expressive actions exhibited by man
and by the lower animals are innate
or inherited&mdash;that is, have not
been learnt by the individual&mdash;is now
admitted by every one” (p. 351).</p>

<p>He must allow us to say that such
a proposition is, in our estimation,
not admitted by every one. With
the exception of the author and a
few monkeyists, we know of no one
who ever advocated any such principle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
It is indeed conceded that a
“tendency” to most of our expressive
actions may be innate or inherited;
but, as to the actions and
expressions themselves, it is commonly
taught by all the schools that
they are performed by instinct and
reason, and perfected by imitation
and experience. What Mr. Darwin
means when he calls expressions
innate and inherited is not the
former&mdash;the tendency&mdash;but the action
itself as transmitted from the father
to the son. He illustrates his meaning
by an example, not quite suitable
for our pages, which may be
found by the curious on p. 44 of his
work. If anything, this example
shows that dogs, and wolves, and
jackals are guided by no reason, and
do not apply the proper means to
attain an end. But does it follow
that man, too, has inherited his external
movements from such progenitors
as monkeys? Does not man
direct even all his external actions by
reason? It is true, he may be led
away by passion; but that is an exception,
and only proves the rule.</p>

<p>But we go further. The Catholic
Church teaches that the human race
is descended from one common pair&mdash;Adam
and Eve. From them the
whole human race was propagated.
Darwin, too, teaches the unity of
mankind. But his is quite a different
unity. Not only do all men descend
from a common human parent, according
to him, but both animals
and men have a common parent; so
that originally there existed one animal,
from which all the rest, men
included, derive their origin.</p>

<p>Now, we should naturally expect
that so grave an inference would be
based upon a no less weighty proof.
But herein we are sadly mistaken.
His whole argument rests upon a
resemblance of some external actions
common to mankind: “I have endeavored
to show in considerable
detail that all the chief expressions
in man are the same throughout the
world. This fact is interesting, as it affords
a new argument in favor of the
several races being descended from a
single parent stock, which must have
been almost completely human in
structure, and to a large extent in
mind, before the period at which
races diverged from each other” (p.
361).</p>

<p>This argument may do very well
to confirm the doctrine of the church;
but we do not see how it will establish
the ape theory, any more than it
would to infer that the sun and
moon are alike because they both
shine. It is really amusing to hear
our author so innocently say: “We
may confidently believe that laughter,
as a sign of pleasure or enjoyment,
was practised by our progenitors
long before they deserved to be
called human” (p. 362).</p>

<p>From all this it is at least evident
that our poor progenitors had to undergo
a long novitiate to become
invested with the habits proper to
man. Theirs, indeed, must have been
a tedious process before attaining human
activity. One thing, however,
he forgets to tell us. It is the period
when such a change of the species
occurred. Theory may sound very
well; but we know of no fact of
the kind. How is it that, as long as
the world can remember, no monkey
ever became a man, or a tree a pig?
We cannot exactly agree with Darwin,
therefore, when he calls the
“anthropomorphous apes our nearest
allies and our early progenitors”
(p. 363). We are quite aware of the
answer he gives to this objection in
his book, on <i>The Origin of Species</i>. But
it may well be compared to the method
of those romance writers who
take good care to place the scene of
the heroic exploits of their heroes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
far distant lands as yet unknown and
unexplored. Thus they may write
volume after volume, without any
danger of being convicted of telling
stories and building castles in the
air. So Darwin. In his <i>Origin of
Species</i>, he pretends that the change
from one species to another is so
long and gradual that it may comprise
even millions of years. As a
conjecture, this may pass; but as an
argument in support of a most elaborate
system, we fail to see its efficacy.</p>

<p>We will now pass to another argument.
Speaking of frowning as shading
the eyes, he says: “It seems
probable that this shading action
would not have become habitual
until man had assumed a completely
upright position; for monkeys do not
frown when exposed to a glaring
light” (p. 363). This phrase can
be made plainer when paraphrased
as follows: It is a theory, established
by me beyond any doubt, that man
is the offspring of the monkey. Now,
the monkey does not frown or shade
his eyes, even when exposed to the
most glaring light of the sun. Hence,
it follows that frowning is an action
peculiarly adapted only to an upright
position. And hence, too, no
wonder that the orang did not make
use of it as long as he was walking
on all fours and bent downwards.
Hence, we must infer that frowning
became a habit, then, only when the
ape, thinking that he had walked
long enough on all fours, and that
he might, without any particular inconvenience
to himself, dispense with
two feet, stood upright, and became
a man. This is the meaning of his
words. On the same principle the following
conjecture is based: “Our
early progenitors, when indignant,
would not hold their heads erect until
they had acquired the ordinary carriage
and upright attitude of man”
(p. 363). Its sense is: As our first
parents were brutes, and as we find
that in no instance they held their
heads erect when angry or indignant,
it follows, of course, that this
action was acquired only after they
made use of their hind feet to walk,
and when the fore paws became
hands.</p>

<p>Blushing is considered by Darwin
an expression that requires attention
to one’s personal defects. Now, as
it has not been observed in any
monkey or other animal, he of course
infers that it became habitual only
when, having emerged from the
monkey phase of existence, we became
semi-human.</p>

<p>“But it does not seem possible”&mdash;these
are his words&mdash;“that any animal,
until its mental powers had been
developed to an equal or nearly
equal degree with those of man,
would have closely considered and
been sensitive about its own personal
appearance” (p. 364).</p>

<p>Thus far we perfectly agree with
him. Blushing is an act predicable
only of an intelligent being. Hence,
it is quite logical to say that animals
could not possess it, unless almost
as perfect as man. But we by
no means so readily coincide with
his conclusion, namely: “Therefore,
we may conclude that blushing originated
at a very late period in the
long line of our descent” (p. 364).</p>

<p>If this were true, it would likewise
follow that man ought to become
more prone to blushing as he advances
in years. This, however, it
will be confessed, is not the case.
Quite the reverse frequently happens.
Youth and innocence blush,
while age and vice grow daily more
barefaced and unblushing. Now, if
blushing were a mere habit acquired
and developed by physical
evolution, how does it come to pass
that full-grown men who are given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
to immorality lose that blush which
rose to their cheeks when young and
innocent? Daily experience only
too well tells the tale how the maiden
blush becomes dimmer and
fades entirely when the career of sin
and shame has been once entered
upon. Where, then, is the philosophy
of Darwin’s principle?</p>

<p>It is quite true, he tells us, that
“we cannot cause a blush by any
physical means. It is the mind
which must be affected” (p. 310);
“that the causes of blushing are shyness,
shame, and modesty; the essential
element in all being self-attention”
(p. 326). Again, he continues:
“Many reasons can be assigned
[as causes of blushing] for believing
that originally self-attention
directed to personal appearance in
relation to the opinion of others was
the exciting cause. Moral causes
are only secondary; the same effect
being subsequently produced
through the force of association by
self-attention in relation to moral
conduct” (p. 326).</p>

<p>This shows that, with Darwin, morality
is a mere matter of etiquette.
“But modesty,” he continues, “frequently
relates to acts of indelicacy;
and indelicacy is an affair of etiquette,
as we clearly see with the
nations that go altogether or nearly
naked. He who is modest, and
blushes easily at acts of this nature,
does so because they are breaches
of a firmly and wisely established
etiquette” (p. 335).</p>

<p>From this, then, it is clear that
morality, chastity, and every species
of virtue are nothing more than the
external code of regulations which
society has agreed upon in its social
intercourse. In other words, all virtue
and morality consist in what we
call good breeding. We blush, not
because we break the law of God,
but because we violate the precept
of man. Darwin’s ten commandments,
we think, might well be summed
up as follows: First commandment:
Society is the Lord God of
man; thou shalt adore it alone, by
minutely observing all its external
regulations, called etiquette. 2d.
Thou shalt not take its name in vain
by saying that man and society can
commit any wrong, or be anything
but perfect. 3d. Thou shalt keep
holy the Sabbath; that is, go to church
on Sunday, because others do so, and
etiquette demands it. 4th. Honor
thy father and thy mother, because
it is customary to do so. 5th. Thou
shalt not be so common a criminal
as to kill a man by direct physical
means; but remember that thou must
hold every man to be a rogue and a
knave until he proves the contrary.
Thou mayest even, especially when
thou art a congressman, take an
oath, without being particular as to
the truth of thy statement. 6th and
9th. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Now, as marriage is merely an ordinary
contract, that can of course
be dissolved when the parties mutually
agree, go to court, obtain a divorce,
and thou canst marry the wife
of another. As to thoughts against
the sixth commandment, thou must
not trouble thy head too much
about them. They are nature’s legitimate
ebullitions. 7th. Thou shalt
not steal in open daylight, but get as
much as thou canst without being
detected. This would constitute the
moral code of Darwin. If morality
is reduced to etiquette, it is evident
that its obligation is merely external.</p>

<p>Finally, we come to another point
in the book on <i>The Expressions</i>, etc.
It is a curious instance of our former
propensities in a primeval state. At
some time or other, we are told, we
were possessed of long ears, and
movable at that, such as we see in
the mule and dog. The elephant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
also, would afford a pretty good specimen,
its ears being long and quite
flexible.</p>

<p>But let us hear him: “If our ears
had remained movable, their movements
would have been highly expressive,
as is the case with all the
animals which fight with their teeth;
and we may infer that our early progenitors
thus fought” (p. 365). Well,
we do not by any means doubt that
these movables would be highly expressive
in man. Just imagine, for
instance, Mr. Darwin going through
the streets of New York with a pair
of long ears, moving and flapping to
his heart’s content! Why, the New
York papers would hail it as a godsend,
and the urchins on Broadway
would go in ecstasies over it.</p>

<p>Our interesting author winds up
his somewhat lengthy dissertations
with the inference that his reasonings
on the “expression of emotions” afford
another confirmatory proof of
his theory that man is the offspring
of the monkey. His two volumes on
the <i>Descent of Man</i> were intended as
the corner-stone of his building. This
later work was to finish it. The
great pity is that he is building a
castle in the air. He gives no proof.
Similarities in man and animals may
afford ground for suppositions, but
can never cause conviction.</p>

<p>“We have seen,” he says, “that
the study of the theory of ‘expression’
confirms, to a certain limited
extent, the conclusion that man is
derived from some lower animal
form, and supports the belief of the
specific or sub-specific unity of the
several races” (p. 367).</p>

<p>We are now done with Darwin.
In perusing the volume, we confess
it was not without a feeling of deep
sadness at so much blindness combined
with no ordinary degree of
learning and research. Darwin is a
student of no mean class. His research
shows that no pains were
spared. His numerous examples demonstrate
that he is perfectly at
home in natural sciences. Mixed
up with error, there is in his book
a great deal both interesting and
highly instructive. His conclusions
might perhaps be correct if there existed
no God, no revelation, and no
eternity. He is a striking example
of men who set aside the revealed
Word of God, and take reason as
their sole guide and standard in the
search after wisdom.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to subjoin a
few general principles that will refute
even more fully the sophisms of the
author.</p>

<p>We lay it down as a certain proposition
that sensation is essentially
distinct from intelligence. Sensation
is defined: “A certain impression
present to the mind, caused by an
external agent on an animated
body.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>This external impression is received
by five sensible organs, viz.:
touch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight.
These are evidently material organs,
having size, weight, figure, extension,
distance, number, motion, and rest.
The same is the case with the object
causing the impressions.</p>

<p>Now, is there any specific difference
between sensation and intelligence?
Is the understanding of man entirely
different from the sensation of the
brute? Or is it merely a development
of the latter? If we believe Darwin,
there is no real difference, except
that the one is more perfect than the
other. In the monkey, there exists
the same faculty of intelligence as in
man. In the former, however, it is
in its incipient stage; in the latter,
it is matured and developed. Can
such a theory be reconciled with
philosophy? We believe not. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
fact, the difference between sensation
and intelligence can be given as
follows: 1. Sensations are external
impressions which are not produced
by the mind, but merely received;
hence they are passive; whilst the
understanding of man is essentially
the actor, and not merely the recipient.
2. Again, “Sensations are particular
facts which never leave their
own sphere.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Intelligence forms
ideas that are universal and absolute,
being applicable to all individuals.</p>

<p>Moreover, sensation does not distinguish
one object from the other,
neither does it compare them. The
illustrious Spaniard whom we have
already quoted illustrates this by
saying: “The sensation of the pink
is only that of the pink, and that of
the rose only that of the rose. The
instant you attempt to compare
them you suppose in the mind an
act by which it perceives the difference;
and, if you attribute to it anything
more than pure sensation, you
add a faculty distinct from sensation,
namely, that of comparing sensations,
and appreciating their similarities
and differences.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>This, indeed, is evident. Sensation
is simply the external impression received.
As such, it is an isolated
act. It does not compare or judge.</p>

<p>The idea, for instance, of the triangle
is one, and is common to all
triangles of every size and kind; the
representation or sensation is multiple,
and varies in size and kind.</p>

<p>Again, the idea or thought of the
mind is fixed and necessary; the
representation changeable.</p>

<p>The idea, <i>e.g.</i>, of the triangle is
“the same to the man born blind,
and to him who has sight; and the
proof of this is that both, in their
arguments and geometrical uses, develop
it in the same manner.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>From what has been thus far said,
it is evident that there exists a dividing
line between the intellect and
sensation; that the one is in no sense
contained in the other, and cannot
by any process be derived from it.
Darwin is a mere sensist. He understands
little of the nature and
faculties of the human soul. He
ignores any essential distinction between
the intellect and sensation.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, it may be observed,
a close connection between the
two. Sensation is the condition of
the exercise of the intellect while
we are in this life. It supplies food
for the intelligence. It always precedes
and accompanies the intellectual
act. Thus, when we think of
God’s mercy, we easily imagine God
as a kind father, etc.</p>

<p>But such is the case only in human
intelligence. We have a spirit
in a material and sensible body. Our
intellect, by its substantial union
with the body, is bound to adapt its
exercises to the conditions imposed
by this union. But unless we deny
all revelation, we must admit the existence
of celestial spirits who are
not possessed of and encumbered by
any body. These, then, need no visible
organs, no external sensation,
no sensible representation, to arouse
and excite their intellect to action.
Hence, it follows that the connection
existing between sensation and intelligence
is not essential.</p>

<p>We shall now examine some other
acts of the intellect, to confirm what
we have said. Judgment is one of
the principal acts of the mind. It
is defined: “The perception and affirmation
of the identity or diversity
of two ideas or propositions obtained
by comparing them.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Thus, in the
proposition, “Man is mortal,” the
mind compares the ideas man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
and “mortal,” and affirms their
identity. The sensation, however, is
an isolated impression on the mind,
a single fact. Another feature of
human actions is the purpose or end
for which a thing is done. The dog
may do things that have great similarity
to human actions; but close
observation will easily convince one
that the brute does so in a uniform
manner, and consequently is impelled
by natural instinct. Man, however,
sits down and deliberates. He proposes
some object to be accomplished,
and carefully selects the means
best calculated to attain that end.
He changes his means at will, according
to the circumstances of the case.
Does any animal, even be it Darwin’s
darling monkey, do anything of the
kind? Moreover, the end or purpose
may be inherent in the act itself; thus,
the sun gives heat and light. An
end, however, may not arise essentially
out of the nature of things, but
may be freely intended; thus, man
chooses different objects, while animals
necessarily perform them.
Again, man observes order in his
actions. Order is defined: “A proper
disposition of things, giving to each
its place”;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> or, “A composition, and
arranging things according to their
proper place.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> This arrangement
may be made either in relation to the
matter, or time, or the object. Now,
do we ever behold animals displaying
order in their actions? Has
even Darwin ever seen a monkey
arranging books in a library in such
a manner as to place alongside each
other those relating to one subject?
We doubt it. We conclude this review
by summing up, in Darwin’s
words, the principles by which he
contends that all our ideas are
acquired. The first is the principle
of serviceable associated habits.
According to it, we gradually acquire
all those habits, ideas, and expressions
that conduce to our interest or
gratification. The second is that of
antithesis&mdash;that is, when something
offered to our interest occurs, we
adopt contrary actions and ideas.
The third is styled by Darwin the principle
of actions due to the constitution
of the nervous system, independently,
from the first, of the will, and
independently, to a certain extent, of
habit. This last principle is simply
what is commonly called instinct. No
one denies that it causes many actions
pertaining to our welfare; but no
man of sound mind will derive from
it intelligence. The first and second
principles can be reduced to that of
utilitarianism. In plain language, it
amounts to this: if all the actions,
thoughts, and desires of man are
regulated merely in accordance with
each one’s private gratification, there
would be no such thing as being
concerned about the welfare of
others. We finish by recalling the
fundamental idea underlying this
work. There are, Darwin tells us,
striking similarities between the external
expressions exhibited by man
and the animal. These cannot be
explained except on the supposition
that the former descends by a long
and slow process of generation from
the latter. This is styled natural
evolution.</p>

<p>There is, we admit, a germ of
truth in the theory of evolution.
The mistake is in applying it without
limit. The Catholic Church teaches,
1. that the soul of man is immediately
created by God. 2. That the
human body also was created in like
manner. This latter, however, is not
so explicitly defined as the former.
3. It is a commonly received opinion
of theologians that all the principal
species of the animal were
created directly by God. 4. That,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
however, imperfect species, such as
hybrids and those generated by
corruption, perspiration&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, fleas&mdash;were
created only in germ, or <i>potentiali
modo</i>.</p>

<p>From this, it is not difficult to see
how far a Catholic may accept
the theory of evolution. Scientists
should not forget that reason is the
handmaid of revelation.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">BY THE AUTHOR OF THE “HOUSE OF YORKE.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="pc1">“SOWING THE WIND.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> cottage where the Geralds
lived was almost the entire inheritance
that had fallen to Miss Pembroke
from those large estates which,
it seemed, should have been hers;
but her wishes were submitted to her
circumstances with a calmness that
looked very like contentment. Mother
Chevreuse called it Christian
resignation, and she may have been
at least partly right. But it was
contrary to Miss Pembroke’s disposition
to fret over irreparable misfortunes,
or even to exert herself very
much to overcome difficulties. She
liked the easy path, and always
chose it when conscience did not
forbid. She made the best of her
circumstances, therefore, and lived a
quiet and pleasant, if not a very delightful,
life. Mrs. Gerald was friendly;
their little household was sufficiently
well arranged and perfectly
homelike; they had agreeable visitors,
and plenty of outside gaiety. On
the whole, there seemed to be no
reason why anything but marriage
should separate the owner from her
tenants.</p>

<p>Of marriage there was no present
prospect. Several gentlemen had
made those preliminary advances
which are supposed to have this end
in view, but had been discouraged
by the cool friendliness with which
they were received. The wide-open
eyes, surprised and inquiring, had nipped
their little sentimental speeches
in the bud, and quite abashed their
killing glances. Miss Pembroke had
no taste for this small skirmishing, in
which so many men and women fritter
away first what little refinement of
feeling nature may have gifted them
with, and afterward their belief in the
refinement of others; and not one
true and brave wooer had come yet.</p>

<p>People had various explanations to
give for this insensibility, some fancying
that the young woman was ambitious,
and desirous to find one who
would be able to give her such a position
as that once occupied by Mrs.
Carpenter; others that she had a vocation
for a religious life; but she
gave no account of her private motives
and feelings, and perhaps could
not have explained them to herself.
She certainly could not have told
precisely what she did want, though
her mind was quite clear as to what
she did not want. Mr. Lawrence
Gerald’s real or imaginary love for
her did not, after the first few
months, cause her the slightest embarrassment,
as it did not inspire her
with the least respect. The only
strong and faithful attachment of
which he was capable was one for
himself, and his superficial affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
were so numerous as to be worthy
of very little compassion, however
they might be slighted.</p>

<p>Sweet-brier Cottage, as it was called,
might, then, be called rather a
happy little nest.</p>

<p>Nothing could be prettier than the
apartment occupied by the owner of
the house, though, since she had her
own peculiar notions regarding the
relative importance of things, many
might have found the mingling of
simplicity and costliness in her furnishing
rather odd. An upholsterer
would have pronounced the different
articles in the rooms to be “out
of keeping” with each other, just as
he would have criticised a picture
where the artist had purposely slighted
the inferior parts. The deal
floors were bare, save for two or three
strips of carpeting in summer, and
sealskin mats in winter; the prim
curtains that hung in straight flutings,
without a superfluous fold, over
the windows, around the bed, and
before the book-case, just clearing
the floor, were of plain, thin muslin,
plainly hemmed, and had no more
luxurious fastenings than brass knobs
and blue worsted cords to loop them
back; but a connoisseur would have
prized the few engravings on the
walls, the candlesticks of pure silver
in the shrine before the <i>prie-dieu</i>,
and the statuette of our Lady that
stood there, a work of art. In cleanliness,
too, Miss Pembroke was lavish,
and one poor woman was nearly
supported by what she received for
keeping the draperies snowy white
and crisp, and wiping away every
speck of dust from the immaculate
bower. No broom nor brush was allowed
to enter there.</p>

<p>“It is such a pleasure to come
here,” Mother Chevreuse said one
day when she came to visit Honora;
“everything is so pure and fresh.”</p>

<p>“It is such a pleasure to have you
come!” was the response; and the
young woman seated her visitor in the
one blue chintz arm-chair the chamber
contained, kissed her softly on
the cheek, removed her bonnet and
shawl, placed a palm-leaf fan in her
hand, then, seated lowly beside her,
looked so pretty and so pleased that
it was charming to see her. These
two women were very fond of each
other, and in their private intercourse
quite like mother and daughter.
Theirs was one of those sweet affections
to which the mere being together
is delightful, though there
may be nothing of importance said;
as two flames united burn more
brightly, though no fuel be added.
It might have been said that it was
the blending of two harmonious
spheres; and probably the idea
could not be better expressed. The
sense of satisfying companionship,
of entire sympathy and confidence,
the gentle warmth produced in the
heart by that presence&mdash;these are
enough without words, be they
never so wise and witty. Yet one
must feel that wit and wisdom of
some kind are there. There is all
the difference in the world between
a full and an empty silence, between
a trifling that covers depth, and a
trifling that betrays shallowness.</p>

<p>Our two friends talked together,
then, quite contentedly about very
small matters, touching now and
then on matters not so insignificant.
And it chanced that their talk drifted
in such a direction that, after a grave
momentary pause, Miss Honora lifted
her eyes to her friend’s face, and,
following out their subject, said
seriously: “Mother, I am troubled
about men.”</p>

<p>But for the gravity that had fallen
on both, Mother Chevreuse would
have smiled at this naïve speech; as
it was, she asked quietly: “In what
way, my dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span></p>

<p>“They seem to me petty, the greater
part of them, and lacking in a fine
sense of honor; lacking courage, too,
which is shocking in a man.”</p>

<p>“Oh! one swallow does not make
a summer,” said Mother Chevreuse,
thinking that she understood the
meaning of this discouragement.
“You must not believe that all men
fail because some unworthy ones do.”</p>

<p>“It is not that at all,” was the
quick reply. “You think I mean
Lawrence. I do not. He makes
no difference with me. I mean the
men from whom one would expect
something better; the very men
who seem to lament that women
are not truer and nobler, and who
utter such fine sentiments that you
would suppose none but a most exalted
and angelic being could please
them or win their approval. I have
heard such men talk, when I have
thought with delight that I would
try in every way to improve, so as to
win their admiration, and be worthy
of their friendship; and all at once,
I have found that they could be
pleased and captivated by what is
lowest and meanest. It is disappointing,”
she said, with a sigh. “It is
natural that women should wish to
respect men; and I would be willing
to have them look down on me,
if they would be such as I could look
up to.”</p>

<p>“Has any one been displeasing
you?” Mother Chevreuse asked,
looking keenly into the fair and
sorrowful face before her. She suspected
that this generalizing sprang
from some special cause. But the
glance that met hers showed there
was at least no conscious concealment.</p>

<p>“These thoughts have been coming
to me at intervals for a good
while,” Miss Pembroke answered
calmly. “But, of course, particular
incidents awaken them newly. I
was displeased this morning. I met
a lady and gentleman taking a walk
into the country, and I did not like
to see them together.”</p>

<p>“But why should you care, my
dear?” asked Mother Chevreuse,
with a look of alarm. She understood
perfectly well that the two
were Mr. Schöninger and Miss
Carthusen.</p>

<p>The young woman answered with
an expression of surprise that entirely
reassured her friend: “Why should
I not care for this case as well as
another? He is a new-comer, and
all my first impressions of him were
favorable. I had thought he might
prove a fine character; and so it is
one more disappointment. But I am
making too much of the matter,”
she said, with a smile and gesture
that seemed to toss the subject aside.
“I really cannot tell why I should
have thought so much about it.”</p>

<p>She bent and gaily kissed her
friend’s hands; but Mother Chevreuse
drew her close in an embrace
that seemed by its passion to be striving
to shield her from harm. She
understood quite well what Honora
did not yet know: that the nature
which the Creator defined from the
beginning when he said: “It is not
good for man to be alone,” had
begun to feel itself lonely.</p>

<p>“I would try not to think of these
things, my dear,” she said earnestly.
“Trust me, and put such thoughts
away. There are good men in the
world, and one day you will be convinced
of that; but it is never worth
while to look about in search of some
one to honor. Think of God, and
pray to him with more fervor than
ever. Add a new prayer to your devotions,
with the intention of keeping
this useless subject out of your mind.
Remember heaven, work for the poor,
and the sinful, and the sick, and,
above all, do not fancy that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
going to make you happy though
you should be acquainted with the
finest men, or win ever so much their
esteem. It isn’t worth striving for,
even if striving would win it. Nothing
on earth is worth working for
but bread and heaven.”</p>

<p>Miss Pembroke looked a little disappointed.
She had expected sympathy
and reassurance, and had received
instead a warning. “I hope,
mother, you do not think me bold in
speaking on such a subject,” she said,
dropping her eyes; and then Mother
Chevreuse knew that she had better
have spoken lightly.</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” she answered,
laughing. “Do you think I fear
you are going to lecture on woman’s
rights?”</p>

<p>And so the little cloud passed
over; and, when her visitor went
away, Honora had quite dismissed
the subject from her mind. There
were her simple household duties to
perform; then Lawrence came home
to take an early luncheon and dress
to go to Annette Ferrier’s, where
there was to be a musical rehearsal;
and, as soon as lunch was over, who
should come in but F. Chevreuse!</p>

<p>Lawrence had a mind to escape
unseen; but the priest greeted him so
cordially, pointing to a chair close
beside his own, that it would have
been rude to go. And having overcome
the first shyness that a careless
Catholic naturally feels in the presence
of a clergyman, he found it
agreeable to remain; for nobody
could be pleasanter company than F.
Chevreuse.</p>

<p>“I beg unblushingly,” he owned
with perfect frankness, when they
inquired how his collecting prospered.
“To-day, I asked Dan McCabe
for a hundred dollars, and got
it. He looked astonished, and so
does Miss Honora; but he showed no
reluctance. At first blush, it may
seem strange that I should take
money that comes from gambling
and rumselling. My idea is this:
Dan is almost an outlaw; no decent
person likes to speak to him, and he
has got to look on society and religion
as utterly antagonistic to him.
He is on the other side of the fence,
and the only feeling he has for decency
is hatred and defiance. He
takes pride in mocking, and pretending
that he doesn’t care what people
think of him. But it is a pretence,
and his very defiance shows that he
does care. It is my opinion that to-day
Dan would give every dollar he
has in the world, and go to work as a
poor man, if he could be treated as a
respectable one. He is proud of my
having spoken to him, and taken his
money, though I dare say he will
pretend to sneer and laugh about it.
You may depend he will tell of it on
every opportunity. Better than that,
he will feel that he has a right to
come to the church. Before this, he
had not, or at least people would
have said he had not, and would
have stared at him if he had come.
Now, if he should come in next
Sunday, and march up to a front
seat, nobody could complain. If
they should, he would have the best
of the argument, and he knows that.
Then, once in the church, we have
a chance to influence him, and he
a chance to win respectability. He
isn’t one to be driven, nor, indeed,
to be clumsily coaxed. The way is
to assume that he wishes to do right,
then act as if he had done right. He
never will let slip a bait like that.
He will hold on to that if he should
have to let everything else go, as
he must, of course. I knew, when I
saw him look ashamed to meet me,
that he wasn’t lost. While there’s
shame, there’s hope. So much for
Dan McCabe. Am I not right,
Larry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span></p>

<p>Lawrence stooped to pick up F.
Chevreuse’s hat, which had fallen, and
by so doing escaped the necessity
of answering. One glance of the
priest’s quick eyes read his embarrassment,
and saw the deepening color in
Honora’s face.</p>

<p>“I am sure you are quite right,
father,” Mrs. Gerald said hastily, with
a tremor in her voice. “Perhaps
Dan would never have been so bad
if too much severity had not been
used toward his early faults. And
so your collecting goes on successfully.
I am so glad.”</p>

<p>The priest, who perceived that he
had, without meaning it, stirred deep
waters, resumed the former subject
briskly:</p>

<p>“Yes, thank God! my affairs are
looking up. But there was a time
when they were dark enough. I
have been anxious about Mr. Sawyer’s
mortgage. He is not so friendly
to us as he was, or else he needs
the money; for he would grant no
extension. Well, I raked and scraped
every dollar I could get, and I
knew that, before next week, I
couldn’t hope to collect above one
or two hundreds in addition; and
still it did not amount to more than
half of the two thousand due. So
I wrote off to a friend in New York
who I thought might help me, and
set my mother praying to all the
saints for my success. For me, I
don’t know what came over me.
Perhaps I was tired, or nervous, or
dyspeptic. At all events, when the
time came for me to receive an
answer to my letter, all my courage
failed. I was ashamed of myself,
but that didn’t help me. While
Andy was gone to the post-office, I
could do nothing but walk to and
fro, and shake at every sound,
and watch the clock to see when
he would be back. I always give the
old fellow half an hour. I wasn’t strong
when he went. In ten minutes I
was weak, in fifteen minutes I was
silly, in twenty minutes I was a fool.
‘I can’t wait here in the house for
him,’ I said; ‘I’ll take to the sanctuary,
and, whatever comes to me
there, it can’t kill me.’ So I left
word for Andy to bring my letters to
the church, and lay them down on
the altar steps, and go away again
without speaking a word; and out I
went, and knelt down by the altar,
like an urchin who catches hold of
his mother’s gown when somebody
says bo! to him. By-and-by, I
heard Andy coming. I knew the
squeak of his boots, and the double
way he has of putting his feet down&mdash;first
the heel, then the toe, making a
sound as though he were a quadruped.
Never had he walked so slowly,
yet never had I so dreaded his
coming. I counted the stairs as he
came up, and found out that there were
fifteen. For some reason, I liked
the number; perhaps because it is
the number of decades in the rosary.
I promised in that instant that, if
he brought me good news, I would
climb those stairs on my knees, saying
a decade on every stair in
thanksgiving. Then I put my hand
over my face, and waited. He lumbered
in, panting for breath, laid
something down before me, and
went out again. I counted the fifteen
steps till he was at the bottom
of them, then snatched up my letter,
and broke the seal; and there was
my thousand dollars! When I saw
the draft, I involuntarily jumped up,
and flung my <i>barrette</i> as high as
I could fling it, and it came down to
me with a mash that it will never get
over. But, my boy,” he said, turning
quickly, and laying his hand on
Lawrence Gerald’s knee, “that your
hat may never be mashed in a worse
cause!”</p>

<p>Lawrence had been listening intently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
and watching the speaker’s
animated face; and, at this sudden
address, he dropped his eyes, and
blushed. Alas for him! his hat had
more than once been mashed in a
cause little to his credit.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued F. Chevreuse,
with triumph, “I have at
home in my strong desk two thousand
dollars, lacking only fifty, and
the fifty is in my pocket. After this,
all is plain sailing. There will be no
difficulty in meeting the other payments.”</p>

<p>The ladies congratulated him
heartily. In this place, the interests
of the priest were felt to be the interests
of the people. Making himself
intimately acquainted with their
circumstances, he asked no more
than they could reasonably give; and
they, seeing his hard and disinterested
labors, grieved that they could
give so little.</p>

<p>Presently, and perhaps not without
an object, F. Chevreuse spoke
incidentally of business, and expressed
his admiration for pursuits
which one of the three, at least, despised.</p>

<p>“There is not only dignity but
poetry in almost any kind of business,”
he said; “and the dignity does
not consist simply in earning an honest
living, instead of being a shiftless
idler. There is something fine
in sending ships to foreign lands, and
bringing their produce home; in setting
machinery to change one article
into another; and in gathering grainfields
into garners. I can easily understand
a man choosing to do business
when there is no necessity for
it. I have just come from a sugarstore
down-town, where I was astonished
to learn that sugar is something
besides what you sweeten your tea
with. It was there in samples ranged
along the counter, from the raw
imported article, that was of a soft
amber-color, to lumps as white and
glittering as hoar-frost. Then there
were syrups, gold-colored, crimson,
and garnet, and so clear that you
might think them jewels. I remembered
Keats’</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">‘Lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon.’</p>

<p class="pn1">They asked me if I would like to
taste these. Would I taste of dissolved
rubies and carbuncles? Why
not I as well as Cleopatra? Of
course I would taste of them. And
how do you suppose they presented
this repast to me? On a plate or a
saucer, a stick or a spoon? By no
means. The Ganymede took on his
left thumb a delicate white porcelain
palette, such as Honora might spread
colors on to paint roses, heliotropes,
and pinks with, and, lifting the jars
one by one with his right hand, let
fall on it a single rich drop, till there
was a rainbow of deep colors on the
white. When I saw that, the sugar
business took rank at once beside the
fine arts. And it is so with other
affairs. If I were in the world, I
would prefer, both for the pleasure
and the honor of it, to be a mechanic
or a merchant, to being in any profession.”</p>

<p>When the priest had gone, Lawrence
Gerald went soberly up to his
chamber, thinking, as he went, that
possibly an ordinary, active life
might, after all, be the happiest. The
influence of that healthy and cheerful
nature lifted for a time, if it did
not dispel, his illusions, as a sudden
breath of west wind raises momentarily
the heavy fogs, which settle
again as soon as the breath dies. For
one brief view, this diseased soul saw
realities thrusting their strong angles
through the vague and feverish
dreams that had usurped his life.
On the one hand, they showed like
jagged rocks that had been deceitfully
overveiled by sunlighted spray;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
on the other, like a calm and secure
harbor shining through what had
looked to be a dark and weary way.</p>

<p>He opened a handkerchief-box, and
absently turned over its contents, rejecting
with instinctive disdain the
coarser linen, curling his lip unconsciously
at sight of a large hemstitching,
and selecting one that
dropped out of fold like a fine, snowy
mist. A faint odor of attar of roses
floated out of the box, so faint as
to be perceptible only to a delicate
sense. The same rich fragrance embalmed
the glove-box he opened
next, and the young man showed the
same fastidious taste in selecting.</p>

<p>It appeared trivial in a man, this
feminine-daintiness; yet some excuse
might be found for it when one contemplated
the exquisite beauty of
the person showing it. It seemed
fitting that only delicate linen and
fine cloth should clothe a form so
perfect, and that nothing harsh should
touch those fair hands, soft and rosy-nailed
as a woman’s. Yet how much
of the beauty and delicacy had come
from careful and selfish fostering,
who can tell? Physical beauty is
but a frail plant, and needs constant
watching; it loses its lustre and freshness
in proportion as that care is
given to the immortal flower it bears.
Both cannot flourish.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind doing business
after it was well established,” he muttered,
carefully arranging one lock
of hair to fall carelessly over his temple,
in contrast with its pure whiteness.
“It is the dingy beginning I
hate. I hate anything dingy. People
mistake when they fancy me extravagant,
and that I like show and
splendor. I do not like them. But
I do like and must have cleanliness,
and good taste, and freshness, and
light, and space.”</p>

<p>What he said was in some measure
true; and “pity ‘tis, ‘tis true” that
simple good taste can, in the city at
least, be gratified only at an extravagant
price, and that poverty necessarily
entails dinginess.</p>

<p>He glanced about the room, and
frowned with disgust. The ceiling
was low, the paper on the walls a
cheap and therefore an ugly pattern,
the chairs and carpet well kept,
but a little faded. Plain cotton
blinds, those most hideous and bleak
of draperies, veiled the two windows,
and an antiquated old mahogany
secretary, the shape of which could
have been tolerable only when the
<i>prestige</i> of new fashion surrounded
it, held a few books in faded bindings.</p>

<p>The young man shrugged his
shoulders, and went toward the door.
As he opened it, the draught blew
open another door in the entry, and
disclosed the shaded front chamber,
with its cool blue and snowy white,
its one streak of sunshine through
a chink in the shutter, and its wax
candle burning before the marble
Madonna.</p>

<p>“That is what I like,” he thought,
and passed hastily by. Annette would
be waiting for him.</p>

<p>The sensible thoughts inspired by
F. Chevreuse lasted only till the
quiet, shady street was passed. With
the first step into South Avenue, and
the first glance down its superb length,
other feelings came, and cottages and
narrow ways dwindled and were again
contemptible. The high walls, and
cupola, and spreading wings of his
lady’s home became visible, and he
could see the tall pillars of Miss Ferrier’s
new conservatory, which was
almost as large as the whole of the
house he lived in. The fascination
of wealth caught him once more, and
the thought of labor became intolerable.</p>

<p>Miss Ferrier was indeed on the
lookout, and, brightening with joyful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
welcome, came out to the porch to
meet her visitor as he entered the
gate. He had so many times forgotten
her invitations that she had
not felt sure of him, and the pleasant
surprise of his coming made her look
almost pretty. Her blue-gray eyes
shone, her lips trembled with a smile,
and a light seemed to strike up
through her excessively frizzled flaxen
hair. If it had only been Honora!
But, as it was, he met her kindly,
feeling a momentary pity for her.
“Poor girl! she is so fond of me!”
he thought complacently, feeling it
to be his due, even while he pitied
her. “But I wish she wouldn’t put
so much on. She looks like a
comet.”</p>

<p>For Miss Ferrier’s pink organdie
flounces streamed out behind her in
a manner that might indeed have
suggested that celestial phenomenon.
She had, however, robbed Peter to
pay Paul; for, whereas one end of her
robe exceeded, the other as notably
lacked.</p>

<p>“Mamma has not yet come back
from her drive,” she remarked, leading
the way into the drawing-room.
“It is astonishing what keeps her so
long.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s one of her distribution
days, isn’t it?” Lawrence asked, with
a little glimmer of amusement that
brought the blood into his lady’s
face.</p>

<p>Two mornings of every week, Mrs.
Ferrier piled her carriage full of parcels
containing food and clothing, and
drove off into some of the poorest
streets of the town, where her pensioners
gathered about her, and told
their troubles, and received her sympathy
and help. The good soul, being
very stout, did not once leave
her carriage, but sat there enthroned
upon the cushions like some bountiful
but rather apoplectic goddess,
showering about her cotton and flannels,
and tea and sugar, and tears
and condolences, and perhaps a few
complaints with them. It is more
than probable that, under cover of
this princely charity, Mrs. Ferrier had
a little congenial gossip now and
then. Among these poor women
were many no poorer than she had
once been, and they were much nearer
to her heart and sympathies than
those whom Annette brought to her
gorgeous drawing-rooms. Mrs. Ferrier
was far from wishing to be poor
again, but for all that she had found
wealth a sad restriction on her tastes
and her liberty. To her mind, the restraints
of society were worse than
a strait-jacket, and it required all Annette’s
authority to keep her from
defying them openly. But here she
was at home, and could speak her
own language, and at the same time
be looked on as a superior being.
Jack and John could leave the carriage,
and step into the little ale-house
at the corner; and, if one of them
should bring her out a foaming glass,
the simple creature would not resent
it. There was always an idle urchin
about who was only too proud to
stand at the horses’ heads while Mrs.
Ferrier had a chat with some crony,
who leaned toward her over the carriage-steps.</p>

<p>Miss Annette was sometimes troubled
by a suspicion that her mother
did not always maintain with her <i>protégées</i>
as dignified a distance as was
desirable; but she was far from guessing
the extent of the good lady’s condescension.
Her hair would have
stood on end had she seen that glass
of ale handed into the carriage, and
the beaming smile that rewarded
John, the footman, for bringing it.
Her misgivings were strong enough,
however, to make her blush with mortification
when Lawrence spoke of the
distribution days. The pleasure with
which she had anticipated a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with her intended husband
died away, and she seated herself in
a window, and anxiously watched for
her mother’s coming.</p>

<p>She was not kept long in suspense.
First there appeared through the
thickly flowering horse-chestnut trees
a pair of bright bays so trained and
held in that their perpendicular motion
equalled their forward progress;
then a britzska that glittered like
the chariot of the sun. In this vehicle
sat Mrs. Ferrier in solitary state.
One might have detected some apprehension
in the first glance she
cast toward the drawing-room windows;
but, at sight of the young
man sitting there beside her daughter,
she tossed her head, and resumed
her self-confidence. She had a word
to say to him.</p>

<p>Jack brought his horses round in
so neat a curve that the wheels missed
the curbstone by only a hair’s
breadth; and John descended from
the perch&mdash;whence during three hours
he had enjoyed the view of a black-leather
horizon over-nodded by the
tip of Mrs. Ferrier’s plume of feathers&mdash;and
let down the step.</p>

<p>We are obliged to confess that
Mrs. Ferrier descended from her
carriage as a sailor descends the
ratlines, only with less agility. But,
what would you? She was already
of a mature age when greatness was
thrust upon her, and had not been
able to change with her circumstances.
Moreover, she was heavy and
timid, and subject to vertigo.</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you, John,”
she said, finding herself safely landed.
“Now, if you will bring that
parcel in. I’d just as lief carry it
myself, only....”</p>

<p>A glance toward the drawing-room
window finished the sentence. Of
course, Miss Annette would be shocked
to see her mother waiting on herself;
and, in all matters relating to social
propriety, this poor mother stood
greatly in awe of her daughter, and,
indeed, led quite a wretched life with
her.</p>

<p>As the lady walked through the
gate and up the steps, with a half-distressed,
half-defiant consciousness
of being criticised, one might find
a slight excuse for the smile that
showed for an instant on the lips of
her intended son-in-law; for it must
be owned that in decoration Mrs.
Ferrier was of a style almost as Corinthian
as her house-front. A rustling
green satin gown showed in tropical
contrast with a yellow crape
shawl and a bird-of-paradise feather;
she had curls and crimps, she had
flounces and frills, she had chains
and trinkets, she had rings on her
fingers, and we should not be surprised
if she had bells on her toes.</p>

<p>“O mamma!” cried Annette,
running out into the hall, “what
made you go out dressed like a
paroquet?”</p>

<p>“Why, green and yellow go together,”
mamma replied stoutly.
“I’ve heard you say that they make
the prettiest flag in the world.”</p>

<p>The young woman made a little
gesture of despair <i>à la Française</i>.
“Of course, colors can’t help going
together when they’re put together,”
she said. “The question is whether
they are in good taste. And cannot
you see, mamma, that what is very
fine for a banner isn’t proper for a
lady’s dress? But no matter, since
it cannot be helped. And now, I
have something to tell you. I read
in a book this morning that fleshy
people could make themselves thinner
by giving up vegetables and
sweets, and living on rare beef and
fruits, and using all the vinegar they
could on things. That’s worth your
trying.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t like raw beef and
vinegar,” cried the mother in dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is not a question of liking,”
replied the young woman loftily. “It
is a question of health, and comfort,
and good looks. It certainly cannot
be to you a matter of indifference
that the whole neighborhood laugh
behind their blinds to see you back
down out of the carriage.”</p>

<p>“Let ‘em laugh,” said the mother
sulkily. “They’d be willing to back
out of carriages all their lives if they
could have such as mine.”</p>

<p>Annette drew herself up with great
dignity: “Mamma, I do not consider
anything trivial when it concerns
the credit of the family. To keep
that up, I would starve, I would work,
I would perform any hardship.”</p>

<p>To do the girl justice, she spoke
but the truth.</p>

<p>“You might take claret with lemon
in it, instead of vinegar,” she added
after a moment. “And, by the way,
I have ordered dinner at half-past
four, so as to be through in time for
an early rehearsal. Mr. Schöninger
is engaged for the evening, and they
are all to be here by half-past five.
Do be careful, ma. Mrs. Gerald is
coming up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for ‘em!” Mrs. Ferrier
burst forth. “I’m tired of
having to mince and pucker for the
sake of those Geralds. What are
they to me? All they want of us is
our money.”</p>

<p>Annette hushed her mother, and
tried to soothe her, leading the way
into a side room; but, having begun,
the honest creature must free her
mind. “You’ve had your say, and
now I want to have mine,” she persisted,
but consented to lower her
voice to a more confidential pitch.
“I’m going to have a talk with
Lawrence to-day when dinner is over.
I sha’n’t put it off. If company
comes before I get through, you
must entertain them. My mind is
made up.”</p>

<p>“Oh! gracious, mamma!” cried
Annette, turning pale.</p>

<p>“There are some things that you
know best, and some that I know
best,” the elder woman went on,
with a steady firmness that became
her. “I give up to you a good
deal, and you must give up to me
when the time comes. I shall talk
to that young man to-day; and, if
you know what is best for you, then
say no more about it. You are not
fit to take care of yourself where
he is concerned, and I’m going to
do it for you. No matter what I
want to say to him. It is my
place to look out for that. All you
have to do is to be quiet, and not
interfere.”</p>

<p>Annette was silent; and, if you
had looked in her face then, you
would have seen that it by no means
indicated a weak character. She
was looking at facts sharply and
bravely, considering which of two
pains she had better choose, and
swiftly coming to a decision. Strong
as was her will in that province
where she ruled, it was but a reed
compared with the determination
her mother showed when her mind
was made up. The daughter would
sometimes yield rather than contend,
and she was always ready with reasons
and arguments to prove herself
right. But the mother had none of
that shrinking, on the contrary, took
pleasure in having a little skirmish
now and then to relieve the tedium
of her peaceful existence; and, not
being gifted in reasoning, was wont
to assert her will in a rather hard
and uncompromising manner. Moreover,
having once said that she
would or would not act in any certain
manner, she never allowed herself
to be moved from that resolve.
This was so well known to her family
and intimates that they took care
not to provoke her to a premature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
decision on questions that affected
their interests.</p>

<p>“Well, mamma,” Annette said,
looking very pale as she yielded,
“you must do as you please. But
don’t forget that Lawrence has not
been used to rough words. And
now it is time for you to change
your dress.”</p>

<p>At these words, the sceptre changed
hands again. Mrs. Ferrier sighed
wearily, remembering the happy days
when she could put on a gown in
the morning, and not take it off till
she went to bed at night.</p>

<p>John, the footman, sat in the hall
as the two ladies came out of the
library, and, instead of going directly
up-stairs as her daughter returned
to the drawing-room, Mrs. Ferrier
made a little pretence of looking
out through the porch, to learn the
cause of some imaginary disturbance.
When at length she went
toward the stairs, she was fumbling
in her pocket, and presently drew
out a small parcel, which she tossed
down over the balusters to John,
standing under. The paper unfolded
in falling, and disclosed a gorgeous
purple and gold neck-tie,
which the footman at once hid in
his pocket.</p>

<p>“Do you like the colors, John?”
she asked, leaning over the rail, and
smiling down benignantly.</p>

<p>He nodded, with a quick, short
answering smile, which shot like
lightning across his ruddy face, disturbing
for only an instant its dignified
gravity.</p>

<p>“Ma, are you going up-stairs?”
called Annette’s sharp voice from the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Yes; if you’ll give me time,” answered
“ma,” hastening on.</p>

<p>There was no reason why she
should not buy, now and then, a
little gift for her servants, and there
was no need of proclaiming what she
had done, and so making the others
jealous. Or perhaps John had asked
his mistress to exercise her taste
in his behalf, himself paying for the
finery. He was a very sensible, independent
man, and did not need
to be pecuniarily assisted.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs, the mistress
of the house met Bettie, the
chambermaid, who had been a witness
to this little scene.</p>

<p>“How do you get along, Bettie?”
the lady asked, trying to patronize.</p>

<p>The girl turned her back and
flounced away, muttering something
about some folks who couldn’t get
along so well as some other folks,
who could go throwing presents over
the balustrade to other folks.</p>

<p>Poor Bettie! perhaps she envied
John his neck-tie.</p>

<p>The rich woman went into her
chamber, and shut the door. “I declare,
I’m sick of the way I have
to live,” she whimpered, wiping her
eyes. “I don’t dare to say my
soul’s my own. I’m afraid to speak,
or hold my tongue, or move, or sit
still, or put on clothes, or leave ‘em
off, or to look out of my eyes when
they’re open.” She wiped the features
in question again. “And now I’m
likely to be starved,” she resumed
despairingly; “for, if Annette sets
out to make me do anything, she
never lets me rest till I do it. I was
happier when I had but one gown
to my back, and could act as I
pleased, than I’ve ever been with all
the finery, and servants, and carriages
that are bothering the life out of me
now. It’s all nonsense, this killing
yourself to try to be like somebody
else, when what you are is just as
good as what anybody is.”</p>

<p>Which was not at all a foolish conclusion,
though it might have been
more elegantly expressed.</p>

<p>She stood a moment fixed in
thought, her face brightening. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
declare,” she muttered, “I’ve a good
mind to&mdash;“ but did not finish the
sentence.</p>

<p>A wavering smile played over her
lips; and as she sat on the edge of
the sofa, with a stout arm propping
her on either side, and her heavily
jewelled hands buried in the cushions,
Mrs. Ferrier sank into a reverie
which had every appearance of being
rose-colored.</p>

<p>When she was moderately pleased,
this woman was not ill-looking,
though her insignificant features
were somewhat swamped in flesh.
Her eyes were pleasant, her complexion
fresh, her teeth sound, and
the abundant dark-brown hair was
unmistakably her own.</p>

<p>She started, and blushed with apprehension,
as the door was briskly
opened, and her daughter’s head
thrust in. What if Annette should
know what she had been thinking
of?</p>

<p>“Ma,” said that young woman,
“you had better wear a black grenadine,
and the amethyst brooch and
ear-rings.”</p>

<p>Having given this brief order, the
girl banged the door in her energetic
way; but, before it was well shut,
opened it again.</p>

<p>“And pray, don’t thank the servants
at table.”</p>

<p>Again the Mentor disappeared,
and a second time came back for
a last word. “O ma! I’ve given
orders about the lemons and claret,
and you’d better begin to-day, and
see how you can get along with such
diet. I wouldn’t eat much, if I were
you. You’ve no idea how little food
you can live upon till you try. I
shouldn’t be at all surprised if you
were to thin away beautifully.”</p>

<p>At last she departed in earnest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrier lifted both hands,
and raised her eyes to the ceiling.
“Who ever heard,” she cried, “of
anybody with an empty stomach sitting
down to a full table, and not
eating what they wanted?”</p>

<p>This poor creature had probably
never heard of Sancho Panza, and
perhaps it would not much have
comforted her could she have read
his history.</p>

<p>We pass over the toilet scene,
where Nance, Miss Annette’s maid,
nearly drove the simple lady distracted
with her fastidious ideas regarding
colors and shapes; and the dinner,
where Mrs. Ferrier sat in bitterness
of soul with a slice of what she called
raw beef on her plate, and a tumbler
of very much acidulated claret and
water, in place of the foaming ale
that had been wont to lull her to her
afternoon slumber. These things
did not, however, sweeten her temper,
nor soften her resolutions. It
may be that they rendered her a
little more inexorable. It is certain
that Mr. Gerald did not find her remarkably
amiable during the repast,
and was not sorry when she left the
dining-room, where he and Louis
Ferrier stopped to smoke a cigar.</p>

<p>She did not leave him in peace
though, but planted a thorn at parting.</p>

<p>“I want to see you in the library
about something in particular, as
soon as you have got through here,”
she said, with an air that was a little
more commanding than necessary.</p>

<p>He smiled and bowed, but a slight
frown settled on his handsome face
as he looked after her. What track
was she on now? “Do you know
what the indictment is, Louis?” he
asked presently, having lighted a cigar,
turned his side to the table, on
which he leaned, and placed his feet
in the chair Annette had occupied.
“Milady looked as though the jury
had found a bill.”</p>

<p>Louis Ferrier, whom we need not
occupy our time in describing, didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
know what the row was, really;
couldn’t tell; never troubled himself
about ma’s affairs.</p>

<p>Lawrence smoked away vigorously,
two or three lines coming between
his smoothly-curved eyebrows; and,
as the cigar diminished, his irritation
increased. Presently he threw the
cigar-end impatiently through an
open window near, and brought his
feet to the floor with an emphasis
that made his companion stare.</p>

<p>“If there is anything I hate,” he
cried out, “it is being called away
into a corner to hear something particular.
I always know it means
something disagreeable. If you want
to set me wild, just step up to me
mysteriously, and say that you wish
to speak to me about something particular.
Women are always doing
such things. Men never do, unless
they are policemen.”</p>

<p>Young Mr. Ferrier sat opposite
the speaker, lolling on the table with
his elbows widespread, and a glass
of wine between them, from which he
could drink without raising it, merely
tipping the brim to his pale little
moustache. He took a sip before
answering, and, still retaining his
graceful position, rolled up a pair of
very light-blue eyes as he said, in a
lisping voice that was insufferably
supercilious: “Ma never does, unless
it’s something about money. You
may be pretty sure it’s something
about money.”</p>

<p>The clear, pale profile opposite him
suddenly turned a deep pink, and
Lawrence looked round at him with
a sharp glance, before which his fell.
The little drawling speech had been
delivered with more of a drawl than
that habitual to Mr. Ferrier, perhaps,
and it seemed that there was a slight
emphasis which might be regarded as
significant. Gerald had not taken any
great pains to conciliate his prospective
brother-in-law, and Louis liked to
remind him occasionally that the advantages
were not all on one side.</p>

<p>Lawrence rose carelessly from the
table, and filliped a crumb of bread
off his vest. “I say, Louis,” he
remarked, “do you know you have
rather a peculiar way of putting your
head down to your food, instead of
raising your food to your mouth?
Reminds one of&mdash;well, now, it’s a
little like the quadrupeds, isn’t it?
Excuse me, that may be taken as a
compliment. I’m not sure but quadrupeds
have, on the whole, rather
better manners than bipeds. Grace
isn’t everything. Money is the
chief thing, after all. You can gild
such wooden things with it. I’m
going to talk about it with your mother.
Good-by! Don’t take too
much wine.”</p>

<p>He sauntered out of the room,
and shut the door behind him.
“Vulgar place!” he muttered, going
through the entries. “Worsted rainbows
everywhere. I wonder Annette
did not know better.” A contrasting
picture floated up before his
mind of a cool, darkened chamber,
all pure white and celestial blue, with
two little golden flames burning in
a shady nook before a marble saint,
and one slender sun-ray stretched
athwart, as though the place had
been let down from heaven, and the
golden rope still held it moored to
that peaceful shore. The contrast
gave him a stifled feeling.</p>

<p>As he passed the drawing-room
door, he saw Annette seated near it,
evidently on the watch for him. She
started up and ran to the door the
moment he appeared. Her face had
been very pale, but now the color
fluttered in it. She looked at him
with anxious entreaty.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind if mamma is rather
... odd,” she whispered hurriedly.
“You know she has a rough way of
speaking, but she means well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked down, and only just
suffered her slender fingers to rest on
his arm.</p>

<p>“I would help it if I could, Lawrence,”
she went on tremulously.
“I do the best I can, but there are
times when mamma won’t listen to
me. Try not to mind what she may
say ... for my sake!”</p>

<p>Poor Annette! She had not yet
learned not to make that tender plea
with her promised husband. He
tried to hide that it irritated him.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I begin to think
that something terrible is coming,”
he said, forcing a laugh. “The
sooner I go and get it over, the better.
Don’t be alarmed. I promise
not to resent anything except personal
violence. When it comes to
blows, I must protect myself. But
you can’t expect a man to promise
not to mind when he doesn’t know
what is going to happen.”</p>

<p>A door at the end of the hall was
opened, and Mrs. Ferrier looked out
impatiently.</p>

<p>“‘Anon, anon, sir!’” the young
man cried. “Now for it, Annette.
One, two, three! Let us be brave,
and stand by each other. I am
gone!”</p>

<p>Let <i>us</i> stand by each other! Oh!
yes; for ever and ever! The light
came back to the girl’s face at that.
She no longer feared anything if
she and Lawrence were to stand
together.</p>

<p>Mr. Gerald walked slowly down
the hall. If his languid step and
careless air meant fearlessness, who
can tell? He entered the library,
where Mrs. Ferrier sat like a highly
colored statue carved in a green
chair, her hands in her lap (her
paws in her lap, the young man
thought savagely). She looked
stolid and determined. The calm
superiority which he could assume
with Annette would have no effect
here. Not only was Mrs. Ferrier not
in love with him, which made a vast
difference, but she was incapable of
appreciating his real advantages over
her, though, perhaps, a mistaken
perception of them inspired her at
times with a sort of dislike. There
is nothing which a low and rude
mind more surely resents and distrusts
than gentle manners.</p>

<p>The self-possessed and supercilious
man of society quailed before the
<i>ci-devant</i> washwoman. What would
she care for a scene? What shrinking
would she have from the insulting
word, the coarse taunt? What
fine sense had she to stop her at
the point where enough had been
said, and prevent the gratuitous
pouring out of all that anger that
showed in her sullen face? Lawrence
Gerald took a strong hold on
his self-control, and settled instantly
upon the only course of action possible
to him. He could not defy the
woman, for he was in some way in
her power. He could marry Annette
in spite of her, but that would
be to make Annette worse than
worthless to him. Not one dollar
could he ever hope to receive if he
made an enemy of Mrs. Ferrier; and
money he must have. He felt now
with a new keenness, when he perceived
himself to be in danger of
loss, how terrible it would be to
find those expectations of prosperity
which he had been entertaining
snatched away from him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrier looked at him glumly,
not lady enough to point him to
a seat, or to smooth in any way the
approaches to a disagreeable interview.
There was no softness nor
delicacy in her nature, and now her
heart was full of jealous suspicion
and a sense of outraged justice, as
she understood justice.</p>

<p>The young man seated himself
in a chair directly in front of her&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
would not act as though afraid
to meet her gaze&mdash;leaned forward
with his arms on his knees, looked
down at the eyeglasses he held, and
waited for her to begin. A more
polite attitude would have been
thrown away on her, and he needed
some little shield. Besides, her
threatening looks had been so undisguised
that an assumption of smiling
ease would only have increased her
anger.</p>

<p>The woman’s hard, critical eyes
looked him over as he waited there,
and marked the finish of his toilet,
and reckoned the cost of it, and
snapped at sight of the deep purple
amethysts in his cuff-buttons, not
knowing that they were heir-looms,
and the gift of his mother. He was
dressed quite like a fine gentleman,
she thought; and yet, what was he?
Nothing but a pauper who was trying
to get her money. She longed
to tell him so, and would have expressed
herself quite plainly to that
effect upon a very small provocation.</p>

<p>“I want to know if you’ve broken
that promise you made me six
months ago,” she said roughly, having
grown more angry with this survey.
“I hear that you have.”</p>

<p>“What promise?” he asked calmly,
glancing up.</p>

<p>“You know well enough what I
mean,” she retorted. “You promised
never to gamble again, and I
told you what you might depend on
if you did, and I mean to keep my
word. Now, I should like to know
the truth. I’ve been hearing things
about you.”</p>

<p>A deep red stained his face, and
his lips were pressed tightly together.
It was hard to be spoken to in
that way, and not resent it. “When
I make a promise, I usually keep it,”
he replied, in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>“That’s no answer to my question,”
Mrs. Ferrier exclaimed, her
hands clenching themselves in her
lap. “I’ll have the truth without any
roundabout. Somebody&mdash;no matter
who&mdash;has told me you owe fifteen
hundred dollars that you lost
by gambling. Is it true or not?
That is what I want to know.”</p>

<p>Lawrence Gerald raised his bright
eyes, and looked steadily at her. “It
is false!” he said.</p>

<p>This calm and deliberate denial
disconcerted Mrs. Ferrier. She had
not expected him to confess fully to
such a charge; neither, much as she
distrusted him, had she thought him
capable of a deliberate lie if the
charge were true&mdash;some sense of his
better qualities had penetrated her
thus far&mdash;but she had looked for
shuffling and evasion.</p>

<p>He was not slow to see that the
battle was at an end, and in the
same moment his perfect self-restraint
vanished. “May I ask where
you heard this interesting story?”
he demanded, drawing himself up.</p>

<p>Her confusion increased. The
truth was that she had heard it from
her son; but Louis had begged her
not to betray him as the informant,
and his story had been founded on
hints merely. “It’s no use telling
where I heard it,” she said. “I’ll
take your word. But since you’ve
given that, of course you won’t have
any objection to giving your oath.
If you will swear that you don’t owe
any gambling debts, I’ll say no more,
unless I hear more.”</p>

<p>He reddened violently. “I will
not do it!” he exclaimed. “If my
word is not good, my oath would
not be. You ought to be satisfied.
And if you will allow me, I will go
to Annette now, unless you have
some other subject to propose.”</p>

<p>He had risen, his manner full of
haughtiness, when she stopped him:
“I haven’t quite got through yet.
Don’t be in such a hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not seat himself again,
but, leaning on the back of a chair,
looked at her fully.</p>

<p>“I wish you would sit down,”
she said. “It isn’t pleasant to have
you standing up when I want to
talk to you.”</p>

<p>He smiled, not very pleasantly,
and seated himself, looking at her
with a steady gaze that was inexpressibly
bitter and secretive. She
returned it with a more piercing regard
than one would have thought
those insignificant eyes capable of.
She had not been able to understand
his proud scruple, and her suspicions
were alive again.</p>

<p>“If all goes right,” she began,
watching him closely, “I’m willing
that you and Annette should be
married the first of September. I’ve
made up my mind what I will do
for you. You shall have five hundred
dollars to go on a journey with,
and then you will come back and
live with me here two years. I’ll
give you your board, and make Annette
an allowance of five hundred
a year, and see about some business
for you. But I won’t pay any debts;
and, if any such debts come up as
we have been talking about, off you
will go. If this story I’ve heard
turns out to be true, not one dollar
more of mine do you ever get, no
matter when I find it out.”</p>

<p>“I will speak to Annette about
it,” he said quietly. “Is that all?”</p>

<p>She answered with a short nod.</p>

<p>Annette was anxiously waiting for
him. “What is it?” she asked,
when she saw his face.</p>

<p>He snatched his hat from the
table. “Come out into the air,” he
said; “I am stifling here.”</p>

<p>She followed him into the gardens,
where an arbor screened them from
view. “Did you know what your
mother was going to say to me?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No!” It was all she had
strength to utter.</p>

<p>“Nothing of it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Lawrence. I saw that
she did not mean to tell me, so I
would not ask. Don’t keep me in
suspense.”</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment. Since
she did not know, there was no need
to tell her all. He told her only
her mother’s plans regarding their
marriage.</p>

<p>“You see it’s a sort of ticket-of-leave,”
he said, smiling faintly.
“We are to be under <i>surveillance</i>.
Hadn’t you better give me up, Annette?
She will like any one else
better.”</p>

<p>The sky and garden swam round
before her eyes. She said nothing,
but waited.</p>

<p>“I only propose it for your sake,”
he added more gently, startled at
her pallor. “In marrying me, you
run the risk of being poor. If that
doesn’t frighten you, then it’s all
right.”</p>

<p>Her color came back again; but
no smile came with it. These shocks
had been repeated too many times
to find her with the same elasticity.</p>

<p>“This cannot go on a great
while,” she said, folding her hands
in her lap, and looking down.
“Mamma cannot always be so unreasonable.
The best way now is to
make no opposition to her, whatever
she proposes. I may be able to influence
her as we wish after a while.
You may be sure that I shall try.
Meantime, let us be quiet. I have
learned, Lawrence, never to contend
unless I can be pretty sure of victory.
It is a hard lesson, but we have to
learn it, and many harder ones, too.
The best way for you is to laugh
and seem careless, whether you feel
so or not. The one who laughs
succeeds. It is strange, but the
moment a person acts as if he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
humiliated, people seem to be possessed
of a desire to humiliate him
still more. It doesn’t do in the
world to confess to any weakness or
failure. I have always noticed that
people stand in awe of those who
appear to be perfectly self-confident
and contented.”</p>

<p>Lawrence Gerald looked at her in
surprise as she said this in a calm
and steady way quite new to him.
Some thought of her being strong
and helpful in other ways besides
money-bringing glanced through his
mind. “You know the world at
least, Annette,” he said, with a half-smile.</p>

<p>No smile nor word replied. She
was looking back, and remembering
how she had learned the world.
She, a poor, low-born girl, ignorant
but enthusiastic and daring, had been
suddenly endowed with wealth, and
thrown upon that world with no one
to teach her how to act properly.
She had learned by the sneers and
bitterness, the ridicule and jibes, her
blunders had excited. Mortification,
anger, tears, and disappointments
had taught her. Instead of
having been led, she had been spurred
along the way of life. She had
seen her best intentions and most
generous feelings held as nothing,
because of some fault in their manifestation;
had found the friendships
she grasped at, believing them real,
change to an evasive coldness with
only a surface-froth of sweet pretence.
Strife lay behind her, and,
looking forward, she saw strife in the
future. As she made this swift review,
it happened to her as it has
happened to others when some crisis
or some strong emotion has forced
them to lift their eyes from their immediate
daily cares; and as the curtain
veiling the future wavered in that
breeze, they have caught a glimpse
of life as a whole, and found it terrible.
Perhaps in that moment Annette
Ferrier saw nothing but dust
and ashes in all her hopes of earthly
happiness, and felt a brief longing to
hide her face from them for ever.</p>

<p>“Your company are coming,”
Lawrence said. He had been
watching her with curiosity and surprise.
It was the first time she had
ever disregarded his presence, and
the first time he had found her really
worthy of respect.</p>

<p>She roused herself, not with a
start, as if coming back to a real
present from some trivial abstraction,
but slowly and almost reluctantly, as
though turning from weighty matters
to attend to trifles.</p>

<p>“Can you be bright and cheerful
now?” she asked, smiling on him
with some unconscious superiority in
her air. “These little things are not
worth fretting for. All will come
right, if we keep up our courage.”</p>

<p>As she held out her hand to him,
he took it in his and carried it to his
lips. “You’re a good creature!” he
said most sincerely.</p>

<p>And in this amicable frame of
mind they went to join the company.</p>

<p>Crichton was eminently a musical
city. In the other arts, they were
perhaps superficial and pretentious;
but this of music was ardently and
assiduously cultivated by every one.
Wealthy ladies studied it with all
the devotion of professional people,
and there were not a few who might
have made it a successful profession.
Among these was Annette Ferrier,
whose clear, high soprano had a
brilliant effect in <i>bravuras</i> or compositions
requiring strong passion in
the rendering. All this talent and
cultivation the Crichton ladies did
not by any means allow to be wasted
in private life. Clubs and associations
kept up their emulation and
skill, and charitable objects and public
festivals afforded them the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
for that public display without
which their zeal might have languished.
The present rehearsal was for
one of these concerts.</p>

<p>They were to sing in the new conservatory,
which was admirable for that
purpose. It was only just completed&mdash;an
immense parallelogram joined to
the southwestern corner of the house,
with a high roof, and tall pillars making
a sort of porch at the end. No
plants had yet been arranged, but
azaleas and rhododendrons in full
bloom had been brought in and set
in a thicket along the bases of the
pillars, looking, in all their airy roseate
flush of graduated tints, as if a
sunset cloud had dropped there.
Against this background the benches
for the singers were ranged, and
Annette’s grand piano brought out
for Mr. Schöninger, their leader.
Sofas and arm-chairs were placed
near the long windows opening into
the house for a small company of
listeners.</p>

<p>“I wish Mother Chevreuse could
have come,” Mrs. Ferrier said, surveying
the preparations with complacent
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Mother Chevreuse was employed
much more to her own liking than
she would have been in listening to
the most excellent music in the
world: she was waiting for her son
to come home from his collecting,
and take tea with her in her cosy
little parlor. If the day should
prove to have been successful to him,
then he could rest a whole month;
and, in expectation of his success,
she had made a little gala of it, and
adorned her room and table with
flowers. The curtains next the
church were looped back, to show a
group of sunlighted tree-tops and
an edge of a bright cloud, since the
high walls hid the sunset from this
room. The priest’s slippers and
dressing-gown were ready for him,
and an arm-chair set in his favorite
place. He must rest after his hard
day’s work. The evening paper lay
folded within reach.</p>

<p>Mother Chevreuse looked smilingly
about, and saw that all was ready.
The green china tea-set and beautiful
old-fashioned silver that had
been preserved from her wedding
presents made the little table look
gay, and the flowers and a plate of
golden honeycomb added a touch
of poetry. Everything was as she
would have wished it&mdash;the picture
beautifully peaceful and homelike.</p>

<p>“What would he do without me?”
she murmured involuntarily.</p>

<p>The thought called up a train of
sad fancies, and, as she stood looking
out toward the last sunny cloud
of evening, long quivering rays
seemed to stretch toward her from
it. She clasped her hands and raised
her eyes, to pray that she might
long be spared to him; but the words
were stopped on her lips. There
was a momentary struggle, then
“Thy will be done!” dropped faintly.</p>

<p>At this moment, she heard a familiar
step on the sidewalk, the street
door opened and banged to again,
and in a moment more F. Chevreuse
stood on the threshold, his face
bright with exercise and pleasure.</p>

<p>“Well?” his mother said, seeing
success in his air.</p>

<p>He drew himself up with an expression
of immense consequence,
and began to declaim:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“‘Dick,’ says he,</p>
<p class="pp6">‘What,’ says he,<br />
‘Fetch me my hat,’ says he,<br />
‘For I will go,’ says he,<br />
‘To Timahoe,’ says he,<br />
‘To the fair,’ says he,<br />
‘To buy all that’s there,’ says he.”</p>

<p class="p1">“You’ve made out the whole
sum!” was her joyful interpretation.</p>

<p>“Yes; and more,” he answered.
“I am rich, Mother Chevreuse. All
the way home, my mind has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
running on golden altar-services and
old masters.”</p>

<p>Mother Chevreuse seated herself
behind the tea-tray, set a green and
gold cup into its appropriate saucer,
and selected a particular spoon
which she always gave her son&mdash;one
with a wheat-ear curling about the
quaint, half-effaced initials; he, insensible
man that he was, unconscious
whether it was silver or tin.</p>

<p>“While you have a resting-place
for the Master of masters, you need
not give much thought to any other,”
she said. “But I own that my
thoughts often run on a golden altar-service.
Only to-day I was reckoning
that what I possess of my own
would buy one.”</p>

<p>“O vanity!” laughed the priest.
“You want to make a show, mother.
Instead of being content to
help with the brick and mortar, or
the iron pillars, you must approach
the very Holy of Holies, and shine
in the tabernacle itself. Fie, Mother
Chevreuse!”</p>

<p>“I mentioned it to F. White,” she
said, “and he almost reproved me.
He said that there was more need
of feeding the hungry than of buying
golden altar-vessels. I told him
that gold endures, but bread is soon
eaten; and he answered that, if the
eating of bread saved from theft or
starvation, and put hope into a
breaking heart, it was making finer
gold than could be wrought into a
chalice. A good deal of grace may
be found in a loaf of bread, said F.
White.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” answered the priest
cheerfully. “F. White has sense,
though he grudges me a gold chalice.
I’ll remember that when he comes
here begging for his organ. F.
White, says I, it’s sheer vanity to talk
of organs when there are suffering
poor in the world. A tobacco-pipe
is better than an organ-pipe, when it
stops an oath in the mouth of a poor
hod-carrier who has no other comfort
but his smoke. Much grace
may be found in a clay pipe, F.
White, my darling.”</p>

<p>Merry, foolish talk, but innocent
and restful.</p>

<p>“And, by the way,” resumed the
priest, “that same F. White has gone
away, and I must go and attend a
sick call for him. I got the telegram
as I came along.”</p>

<p>“Not to-night!” the mother exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, to-night. I sent word that I
would come. The man is in danger.
Besides, I could not spare time to-morrow
forenoon. I can drive the
five miles before ten o’clock, stay
the rest of the night there, and come
home in the morning in time to say
Mass at six o’clock. That is the best
plan. I don’t care to be out very late.”</p>

<p>“It is the better way,” she said,
but looked disappointed. “I don’t
like to have you out late at night, it
gives you such headaches.”</p>

<p>“Headache is easier to bear than
heart-ache, mother,” said the priest
brightly, and went to the window to
give Andrew his order for the carriage.
“Have it ready in front of
the church at a quarter before nine
o’clock,” he said. “And, Andrew,
light the gas in the sacristy.”</p>

<p>Mother Chevreuse anxiously served
her son, urged him to take a muffler,
lest the night air should prove chilly,
poured a second cup of tea for him,
and, when he was ready to start, stood
looking earnestly at him, half in
pride of his stalwart manliness, half
in tender, motherly anxiety lest some
accident should befall him on the
long, lonely drive.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better take Andrew
with you?” she suggested.</p>

<p>“And why should I take Andrew
with me?” the priest asked, putting
a stole in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why ...” she hesitated, ashamed
of her womanish fears.</p>

<p>“An excellent reason!” he laughed.
“No, madam; I shall take no
one with me but my good angel.
My buggy holds but two. Good-night.
Sleep soundly, and God bless
you!”</p>

<p>She stood with her lips slightly
parted, watching him earnestly, as if
fearful of losing some slight word or
glance; but his cheerful talk woke no
smile in her face.</p>

<p>He would not appear to notice
anything unusual in her manner, and
was going out, when she stopped
him.</p>

<p>“Give me your blessing, dear, before
you go,” she whispered, and fell
on her knees before him; and, when
he had given it, she rose and tried to
smile.</p>

<p>The priest was disturbed. “Don’t
you feel well to-night, mother?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite well,” she replied gently.
“Perhaps I am foolish to be so
nervous about your going. It seems
a lonely drive. Go now, or you will
be late.”</p>

<p>She followed him to the door, and
stood there till she saw him come
out of the church, step into his
buggy, and drive away.</p>

<p>“Good-night! good-night!” she
said, listening till the last sound of his
carriage-wheels died into stillness;
then, breathing a prayer for his safety,
she went back to her own
room.</p>

<p>Jane had cleared away the table,
drawn the curtains, and lighted a
lamp, and had gone down to her
company in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“What does make me so lonely
and fearful?” exclaimed the lady,
wringing her cold hands.</p>

<p>She busied herself in little things,
trying to drive the trouble away;
refolded the paper her son had not
found time to read, pushed his arm-chair
nearer the table for herself, and,
discovering a flake of smooth-pressed
clay which his boot had left on the
carpet, took it up, and threw it into
the fireplace. That homely little
service brought a faint smile to her
face.</p>

<p>“The careless boy!” she said
fondly. “He never could remember
to wipe his boots on coming in, even
when he was a mere lad. I can see
his bright face now as it looked
when he would argue me out of
scolding him. His mind was occupied
with lofty matters, he said;
he could not bring it down to boots
and mud. It sounded like a jest;
but who knows if he might not even
then have been about his Father’s
business!”</p>

<p>Dropping into his chair, she sat
thinking over the old time and her
boy’s childhood. How happy and
peaceful their life had been! Half
chiding herself, as if she knew he
would have called it folly, she went
into her bedroom, and brought our
a little trunk, in which were preserved
<i>souvenirs</i> memorable in her life and
his.</p>

<p>There was his christening-robe.
She shook out the length, and pushed
two of her fingers through the tiny
embroidered sleeve.</p>

<p>“How little we dream what the
future is to be!” she murmured.
“I wonder how I would have felt
if, when I was embroidering this,
there had risen before my eyes the
vision of a chasuble hanging above
it? But I couldn’t have been prouder
of him than I was. He was a
fine healthy boy, and had a will of
his own even then. When he was
baptized, he got the priest’s stole in
his baby fist, and I had to pull it
away finger by finger, the little fellow
clinging all the time.”</p>

<p>There were boyish toys, schoolbooks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
adorned with preposterous
pencil-drawings, in which the human
figure was represented by three
spheres set one over the other, and
supported on two sticks; there were
letters written his mother while he
was away from home, at school or
college, and a collection of locks of
hair cut on successive birthdays, till
the boy had laughed her out of the
custom. She placed these side by
side now, ranging them according to
their dates, and studied the gradual
change from the silken-silvery crescent
of a curl cut from the head of
the year-old babe, through deepening
shades, to the thick brown
tress cut on his twentieth birthday.
Every little lock had its story to tell,
and she went over each, ending with
a kiss, in fancy kissing the child’s
face she seemed again to see. And
as she sat there conning the past,
memory struck every chord of her
heart, from the sweet, far-away
vibration when her first-born was
placed in her arms, and coming
down through deepening tones to
the present.</p>

<p>She lifted her face, that had been
bent over these mementos. “Now
he is Father Chevreuse, and I am
an old woman!” she said; and, sighing,
rose and put the souvenirs all
away. “We have had a glad and
prosperous life; how little of sorrow,
how little of adversity! I never before
realized how much I have to be
thankful for.”</p>

<p>Presently she put a veil over her
head, and went out through the
basement into the church to say her
prayers. She always said her evening
prayers before the altar; and
now she had double cause to be
scrupulous. She must atone for
past unthankfulness, and pray for
her son’s safe return.</p>

<p>By ten o’clock, the house was
closed for the night, and the inmates
had all gone to their quiet slumber.
Mother Chevreuse’s uneasiness was
all gone, and, after devotions of unusual
fervor, she felt an unwonted
peace. “Father, into thy hands I
commit my spirit!” she said, and
sank to sleep as soon as her head
touched the pillow.</p>

<p>About midnight, she started up,
wide-awake, and listened. There
was a low, stealthy sound, as of a
door being softly opened. Could
her son have changed his mind, and
come home again? Some one was
certainly in his room. She stepped
out of bed, and listened keenly.
There was a faint noise like the rattle
of a latch or lock, and then a soft
step retreating.</p>

<p>“It is he come back!” she thought
joyfully; and, even in thinking so,
was smitten by a wild and sudden
fear. She slipped on a dressing-gown
and sandals, and hurried toward
the door. “My son!” she
said breathlessly as she opened it.</p>

<p>Faintly seen in the dim light, a
man’s form was leaving the room by
the entry. A shawl or cloak wrapped
him from head to foot, and he held
a little chest in his hand. In that
chest F. Chevreuse kept his money.</p>

<p>All personal fear deserted his
mother’s heart at that sight. She
thought only that the fruit of her
son’s long labors was being carried
away under her eyes, and that, after
the brief joy of his success, he would
come home to bitterness and disappointment.</p>

<p>She ran after the retreating figure,
and caught it by the arm. “Shame!
shame!” she cried. “It is the money
of the poor. It belongs to God.
Leave it, in God’s name.”</p>

<p>The man bent down, and wrapped
his form still more closely from recognition,
as he wrenched himself
loose. But while forced to let go
his arm, she caught at the casket he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
held, and clung with all her strength,
calling for help.</p>

<p>“Let go!” he said, in a hoarse
whisper. “Let go, or I shall do you
harm!”</p>

<p>As she still clung and cried for
help, they stood at the head of the
stairs leading to the basement of the
house. Steps were heard below, and
Jane’s voice calling Andrew, and
screaming from the window.</p>

<p>The man made one more fierce
effort to free himself. Drawing back
from the stairs, he turned quickly,
and threw himself forward again.
There was a sharp cry, “My son!”
and a fall. Then a fainter cry, “My
God!” and then silence.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c676" id="c676">TRAVELLERS AND TRAVELLING.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">What</span> does one gain by travelling?
says some old wiseacre, with a
shake of the head. Better the man
that settles down and grows with
his native or adopted dwelling-place.
“The rolling stone gathers no moss,”
is a venerable saying. Men who
stay only a short time in one place
can never be sufficiently known or
loved by any people, and hence their
credit and fortune cannot increase.</p>

<p>What does one not gain by travelling?
says the boy who is just old
enough to relish <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>,
whose natural curiosity is feverish for
knowledge. For him, all countries are
more interesting than his own. He
longs to climb the hill that bounds
his native plain, to see what lies
beyond. No one for him so interesting
as the soldier or sailor come back
from foreign lands, and he asks, with
deep, attentive inquiry, “if there are
boys in such places, too, and whether
they are born there, or if they also
went away from here?” Power,
wealth, beauty, have no charm for
him. Money he values merely because
it opens his path to distant
lands; and his instinctive desire to
know is the passion of his youth.
This is the story of all of us, at least
all of us boys. It is only when our
curiosity is satisfied either by personal
experience or by credible hearsay,
when we meet members of the whole
human family, and find them seeking
in our country that peace and beauty
which we used to ascribe to theirs&mdash;it
is then we realize that life is not
poetry; that one’s native land is generally
happiest for him; and that the
best thing for one to do is to choose
a spot thereof, and, as “H. G.” used
to say, “to settle down and rise
with it.”</p>

<p>Between the sturdy proverb of
the oldest inhabitant and the boundless
dream of the boy exists the
medium wherein we shall find the
uses of travel. There is nothing
which may not be abused, and travelling
may degenerate into a passion
in individuals; but the strength
of the ties of country, home, and
family, whereby nature has bound
us, forbids any but solitary instances
of men who have wandered, useless
vagabonds on the earth, trespassing
on all countries, and aiding none;
while, if the Holy Ghost call forth
some apostle from his kindred to
sound the trump of faith among
many peoples, the Lord, who gives
him an extraordinary mission, will
endow him with special grace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
the world will gain by his vocation.
This is the greatest traveller: who
goes forth, not to his own gain, nor
to further his nation’s weal, but to extend
the kingdom of God on earth;
to enlighten those who sit in darkness,
and bring them to the knowledge of
the truth.</p>

<p>Why do people travel? People
travel for health, for pleasure, for
business, and for knowledge. Some
fifty thousand Americans travelled
in Europe last summer with one or
other of these objects in view. Have
they all gained by their trip? Has
the nation profited? Are they healthier,
happier, richer, wiser, for their
tour in Europe? A general answer
to these questions cannot be given.
All depends on the character of the
individuals who composed that large
army. Their particular circumstances
and characteristics may have
caused some to gain, others to lose,
both when there is question of health,
as well as when we speak of enjoyment,
riches, and useful knowledge.
I was one of that invading army
that descended on Europe last
year, and will try to make others
partakers of whatever is communicable
of the advantages derived from
the trip which under advice I took
to the other hemisphere. We will
see who are they that lose by going
abroad, what danger and damage
they incur, and the reasons why.
We will also find what persons profit
by the excursion, what dispositions
are required for this; and, by contrasting
and comparing each, we
shall be enabled to conclude how
much of loss and how much of gain
there is in travel, how the one is
avoided, and the other achieved.
All this I will make bold to illustrate
from my own experience.</p>

<p>A change of air is well known to
influence one’s health very much;
for a man lives as much on good
air as on what are commonly considered
the elements of sustenance.
I heard a gentleman state that the
change from Newburg to New York
in summer had caused him to gain
eleven pounds in a fortnight. It was
all in the change. A citizen flying
from this pent-up atmosphere to the
expanded vision and pure breezes
of that delightful town could hardly
have gained more in the same period.
Hence the doctors prescribe
change of air so frequently. An
English physician says: “It is undoubted,
explain it how we may,
that a change of air, diet, and scene
rouses the faculties, improves the
appetite, and raises the spirits.
When you set out for France, then,
on your little trip of twenty-five
miles across the channel, pray Heaven
you may get thoroughly sea-sick,
that nothing old or vitiated may
make a bad foundation for the new
man you are going to build up.”
People from the plain gain by a
change to the mountains; people
from the mountain by visiting the
plains. People from inland by
going to the sea-shore, and those
from the beach by retiring to the
meadows. As with the body, so
with the mind. Our faculties become
as it were choked up and
stagnant by continual monotony;
even the most brilliant conversation,
music, the best jokes of a friend, fail
at last to please or rouse the spirit.
Activity and exercise are necessary
for the mind and soul as well as
for the body, and are obtained by
seeking contact and conflict with
new ideas, sights, and wonders to
move the imagination; and the consequent
enlivening of the spirits acts
at once on the body, and does more
to restore physical power than any
material food. It is by visiting foreign
places; seeing strange customs
which excite our curiosity; wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
at Alpine heights and Rhenish castles;
sympathizing with the decayed
glories of Venice and old Rome; confronting
ourselves with the soul-entrancing
beauty of the Bay of Naples
and the awe of that burning mountain
which stirs the depths of the spirit&mdash;it
is thus we produce that friction,
that reaction requisite for rousing
soul and body from tepidity and the
stagnancy of hypochondria and disease.
Our spirits rise, the circulation
is quickened by the winds of
France and the music of Italy, the
strange <i>cuisine</i> of other lands start all
our organs into activity, and happiness
and health are the result.</p>

<p>There are those, however, who
travel, and yet gain neither in spirits
nor in health. What often makes
the difference, other things being
equal, is the bigotry and contrariety
of certain individuals. Some persons
are so ignorant, and therefore so bigoted,
that they will never tolerate
customs different from their own,
hold all who think otherwise than
they in profound contempt, and will
persist in following their own ways no
matter where they go, and although
the habits and opinions of an entire
nation are opposed to them. Such
persons never gain good spirits; for
they will not open the windows of
their miserable little souls, to let in
the rays of happiness in which the
people about are basking. An Englishman
of fifty years ago, for instance,
sets out with the notion that
whatever is not English is contemptible.
Hence, he is disgusted with
the pleasant sounds of the French
tongue; the agreeable politeness of
the lady in the restaurant irritates
him&mdash;perhaps he feels angry that a
Frenchwoman should be so much at
ease in his presence; the play he despises,
because his taste is too debased
to rise to its enjoyment, or because
Parisians applaud it. He will have
his beefsteak in the morning and his
heavy slices of bread, no matter
though the whole French nation
should think a light breakfast more
healthful. Hence, it is impossible
that this man’s health should improve.
Instead of getting mentally
sea-sick (he can’t help getting bodily
so; and the prouder he is, the more
amusing his appearance then), and
throwing off prejudice, he keeps in
his mind a bile that jaundices his
views, and corrodes every healthy
idea that may possibly enter his
soul. He follows his own notions
at the table; and, as the food and
habits of his northern isle do not
suit southern latitudes, of course he
gains nothing in health, and often
becomes sick, and returns home disgusted
with dons and messieurs,
signors and mynheers, and tells you
“there’s no use in travel&mdash;he tried
it.” The first requisite, then, is, when
you go to Rome, to do as the Romans
do. The customs of a place
show what its inhabitants prefer; and
it is silly in any man to set his own
little ideas against the experience of
a whole people.</p>

<p>My friend and I had the misfortune
to meet one of this class on setting
out on our trip, and thrown together
as we necessarily were on an
ocean steamship, it caused us a great
deal of inconvenience. The poor
man was actually yellow from dyspepsia
and bigotry. I am sorry to
say he passed for an American.
Whether his bigotry caused that viselike
fastening up of his better nature,
and, reacting on his body, ruined his
digestion, as might easily be, or
whether the desperate state of his
chylopoetic fluids produced a corresponding
straitness in his soul,
which we assumed as the more charitable
supposition, I can’t say; but
certainly all the benefit of new and
entertaining society, all the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
of sea air, change of diet, etc.,
were lost, necessarily lost to him.
What was the cause of his old-fogyism?
One dreadful incubus&mdash;you
might call it a standing evil, a
nightmare (diurnal as well as nocturnal)&mdash;was
the presence at the same
table, and in the willing association
of those whom he also preferred, and
whose company he courted, of us
two priests. The man could not
look us in the face, could not accept
the salt at our hands, would not “do
us the pleasure of wine,” as they say
on English ships; in fact, his bigotry
stood between him and his own enjoyment
and good appetite, rendered
our position disagreeable, caused
the rest of the company (Protestants
themselves) to condemn his behavior
in the strongest terms on deck, and
ruined the pleasure of our voyage, at
least during the time spent at table.
One of his acquaintances was a
whole-souled, honest, generous gentleman,
a Methodist from Brooklyn.
He, on his part, took every opportunity
to throw sunshine about him,
and to be polite to us especially, as
if to make up for the fellow’s savageness;
and one day, when the dyspeptic
was complaining to the waiter as
bitterly as if he were being flayed
alive, the other turned to him, and
said aloud: “Ebenezer, if I was an
undertaker getting up a funeral, I’d
hire you for chief mourner.” John
invited us to his cabin, and the other
turned away from its door when he
saw us within. John proposed to
take his cheerful, amiable wife to
Ireland first; Ebenezer declared his
abhorrence of the Irish and his contempt
for Killarney. “He wouldn’t
advise anybody to go to Ireland;
he’d been there three times, and
there was nothing to see but beggars.”
John took him up before the company:
“Why did you go there the
second and third time, Eben?”&mdash;a
question which disconcerted the
dyspeptic, and caused intense amusement
to the passengers. Such an
one had no use to go travelling for
health or anything else. You must
open the windows of your soul, slacken
the risible muscles of your face,
and reduce yourself to a soft, pliable,
impressionable condition, if you want
to benefit by change of air, scenery,
and society. Dry, hard wax does not
receive the impression of the seal.
But let a man set out with proper
dispositions, leave care and prejudice
behind, be ready to speak of men
and things as he will find them, let
no thought of business come up for
a while, but move along easily and
quietly through the scenes and people
of other lands, and he will experience
the advantages of travelling for
health.</p>

<p>Another motive for travel is business.
The post and the telegraph
afford wonderful facilities for carrying
on commercial relations between
different firms and branches of the
same house in different countries; but
many circumstances render personal
visits and interviews often necessary.
Hence, the number of travellers on
business is very large. Many New
York houses send trusty men to Europe
annually or oftener to buy the
stuffs and to inspect and select the
styles which fickle fashion imposes
on her votaries.</p>

<p>The American is not satisfied with
looking through foreign eyes, for he
knows that short or long-sightedness
is often the defect of even business
men in those old countries. Hence,
he goes to see and inspect for himself,
and commonly finds an opening
where the Frenchman, the German,
even the Englishman, did not suspect
its existence; throws a bridge over a
chasm which to them seemed impassable;
works his way through difficulties
they thought unsurmountable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
and pushing on over precipices and
untrodden ways, “that banner with
the strange device, Excelsior,” in his
hands, astonishes the natives, and
secures the trade of the world. Thus
Singer, the sewing-machine man,
goes to the ancient mediæval city of
Nürnberg, amongst other places&mdash;a
city seemingly so dead as to have
recently erected another monument
to Albrecht Dürer, the artist, the only
statue in the town; as if the last man
of push and note they produced was
dead 350 years. Singer goes to this
sleepy old city, and, in spite of the
depth and inflexibility of the old
channels in which trade had been
running for a thousand years, attempts
to revolutionize it all at once
with his sewing-machine. In spite
of the opposition of the tailors, which
similar endeavors in parts of Great
Britain failed to overcome, he succeeds;
for, instead of hiring a plain
office, in the simple manner of the
country, and cautiously investing a
little capital at the outset, the American,
with characteristic enterprise and
self-approved wisdom, spends hundreds
in advertising and thousands in
erecting a building the most imposing
and expensive of its kind in the venerable
city, astonishes the slow Bavarians
while attracting them by the employment
he gives, makes them believe
that he is indeed the bringer of
the great good he claims, obtains their
trade, and, while filling his own
pockets, is a herald of his country’s
genius and enterprise. Another instance:
while sailing down the
Rhine last October in one of those
steamers which approach nearest to
the graceful beauties of our own
rivers, and which are therefore most
highly praised by tourists, we were
a little surprised and considerably
proud at seeing “Lent’s Floating
American Circus” (like a vast floating
bath) paying a visit to one of
the cities of that noble stream, up
and down whose banks it for ever
roves, catering for the amusement
and instruction and picking up the
loose thalers of Fatherland with as
much <i>sang-froid</i> as Dan Rice on our
Mississippi. When the people of the
Continent behold the Americans coming
three thousand miles over the sea,
passing inside England, from whom
we learnt these very institutions, whose
child our nation was, they naturally
form a very high opinion of the superior
enterprise and skill of the
republic, so that our democratic
institutions gain respect and our flag
honor, while English influence gradually
decays. Thus George Pullman
goes over and steps in before John
Bull, and secures the sleeping-car
business on the Continent. Nay, it
is only now that, roused by his
aggressive boldness, England begins
to adopt our great improvements in
travel, afraid of being left still more
shamefully behind. Thus does the
business traveller, while making his
own fortune, advance his country’s
name and influence; and his successful
policy is always that of generosity,
accommodation, and politeness.</p>

<p>A class of men called commercial
travellers is very numerous in England
and Ireland. They are a relic
of the period preceding this great
advertising age, and go about from
town to town soliciting orders and
selling goods of which they carry
samples. Many of them are peddlers
also, and sometimes carry great value
in money, jewelry, etc., and offer
story-tellers an attractive field for
wild tales of robbery on lonely roads,
and murder in wayside inns. They
all have some story of this kind to
relate. In Ireland, a room in every
hotel is set apart, called the commercial
room, for the exclusive use
of these men, whose business transactions
and responsibility require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
special care and convenience, and
where they can deposit their valuables
without danger of loss or damage.
I was in a car once with one
of these lonely gentlemen, and he
told me he travelled from the 1st of
January to the 23d December.</p>

<p>The company of a wife is not considered
conducive either to economy
or to profit; but their life must be
a dreary one, especially in Ireland,
where the accommodation on the
railroads and in some of the country
hotels is not only very poor, but even
dangerous to health. In England
even, they have just begun to heat
their cars, which are far below those
on the Continent; and in Ireland, at
least in winter, I have had to sleep
in a room with a quarter inch of
mildew dank and dark upon the
walls. Persons travelling for pleasure,
however, are not generally subjected
to this last inconvenience, as
the localities frequented by tourists
are furnished with whatever is needful
for their comfort.</p>

<p>Pleasure is, doubtless, the object
of most travellers; but it includes
much more than the word in its
usual acceptance might imply. The
wealthy English travel in the mild,
genial climates of southern Europe
during the prevalence at home of that
indescribably abominable weather
which sits on London like a plague
during the autumn and winter. Some
of them also go abroad because they
cannot afford to reside at home.
They revel in the atmosphere of
Rome and Naples&mdash;so mild that
oranges bloom and flowers deck the
walls all through the wintry season.
The sun is bright, while the weather
is not so mild as to interfere with
balls, parties, concerts, etc.; and
hunting the fox, the wild boar, and
the deer, with the intoxicating pleasures
of the carnival, and visits to the
interesting monuments of pagan and
Christian times, make up a round of
diversion and entertainment peculiar
to Italy.</p>

<p>The American tourist partakes of
the same enjoyments, only that his
pleasure is sometimes interrupted
and marred by the workings of his
practical and ever-active brain. I
heard of one of our countrymen paying
a moonlight visit to that noblest
of ruins, the Coliseum, in company
with a party composed of various
nationalities. While they gazed in
silent, entranced contemplation at its
dark majesty, with the rays of the
pale planet making its black recesses
visible by contrast; while they pictured
to themselves 100,000 fair women
and brave men seated in its circuit,
witnessing the bloody tragedy
of the dying gladiator or the triumphant
martyr of Christ, the Yankee
was asked his impressions, and replied,
on reflection, that “it was
rayther large, but money might be in
the concern if ‘twas only roofed in
and whitewashed!”</p>

<p>I need not go to great length to
show the pleasure which travelling
affords; the delight which all take
in seeing new and strange places,
customs, works of art, ruins of antiquity,
cataracts, mountains, rivers,
etc.&mdash;all of which have a wonderful
charm in lightening one’s heart,
wearied by care; in purifying and
strengthening the brain, dimmed and
dizzied by labor, and filling us with
pure and exquisite delight. Besides,
many find in travel a refuge from
the routine of fashion, and the prospect
of that lingering pain which follows
her severe, artificial, often painful
enjoyments. In other countries
you do as you please. You are not
criticised if you be not absolutely <i>en
rapport</i> with the usages of the tyrant
fashion at home, because she has
stayed there; nor with the ways of
her sister abroad, because no one extages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
pects you to be <i>au fait</i> in customs
not your own. Moreover, you can
live more cheaply, and your health
is benefited by the change. Hence,
families broken down often leave
England and go abroad for economy’s
sake, thus obtaining freedom
by their apparent misfortune.</p>

<p>The student of history and the
classics is the one who finds most
pleasure in visiting foreign lands.
Every town, every river, plain, mountain
range, and country, has an indescribable
attraction for him, and
he gazes still charmed upon scenes
which may very soon sate the curiosity
of others. His pleasure is
one which, if you are a reader, you
will appreciate; and, if not, it would
be impossible for me to make you
understand. See one of these visiting
Lake George. His imagination
covers the water with the three hundred
boats in which Montcalm advanced
to the siege of Fort William
Henry. He sees Leatherstocking
and Uncas plodding through the
forest on their war-path, dropping
silently down the stream by night,
and putting up their heads from under
the water for a stolen breath of
air, while the bushes on the bank are
filled with savages watching for their
scalps; stopping to eat and drink in
the middle of the forest at what we
now call the Congress Spring at
Saratoga. Let him gaze for the first
time on the coast of Ireland&mdash;what
an interest has that venerable and
lovely land for him! He at once
looks out for the ruined castles of
her decayed nobility; he seeks thirstingly
a sight of those round towers
which stand old but fresh monuments
of that time “when Malachy wore
the collar of gold which he won from
the proud invader”; and he remains
alone, apart on the deck, recalling in
sad satisfaction the scene that presented
itself long ago, when abbeys,
churches, and schools crowned the
fair hill-tops of Erin. Let him stroll
companionless through London’s
busy streets&mdash;he is not alone. David
Copperfield, Pickwick, Micawber,
Sim Tappertit, Agnes, Little Dorrit,
Bill Sykes, and Fagin are always
passing and repassing; acting their
parts for his entertainment. Let him
view the tall, white cliffs of Dover,
and he sees Cæsar’s fleet approaching
to the conquest of Albion. Calais recalls
the days of Catholic England’s
greatest military glory. Every spot of
France, Germany, Italy lives again
for him in one short space its life of
two or three thousand years; for all
the events of its history, all the heroes
of its glory, are present to his
memory and imagination even more
than their present phases to his vision
to-day. He sees the tradesmen
of Flanders, the butchers, bakers,
weavers, smiths, combining for the
liberation of their country at the
battle of the Golden Spurs, so called
from the immense number of these
articles found on the field, representing
the number of professional soldiers
of knightly rank slain by these
bold democrats, whose liberties they
came to invade. He feasts his eyes
upon the “vine-clad hills of Bingen,
fair Bingen on the Rhine,” which his
boyish imagination had pictured and
laid back in the most loving recesses
of his heart. In Switzerland, the
mountain-passes are crowned for him
by the native heroes, sons of Tell,
and of those others who, in the days
of Catholic Switzerland, rose against
the Austrian despot, and in a band
of 1,300 patriots defeated 60,000
hirelings of tyranny at the battle of
Morgarten. At Innsbruck, he venerates
the soil consecrated by the
deeds of the citizen-soldier and martyr
of liberty, Andreas Höfer; at
Venice, he recalls the glories of the
republican queen of the seas; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
his interest and pleasure reaching
their height in the city of the popes,
he pursues a boundless career of enjoyment
as he gazes on the monuments,
walks over the localities, peoples
again the streets and forums,
making all the heroes, poets, and
great women of royal, republican,
imperial, and Papal Rome live their
lives and do their great deeds over
again, and all for him, all for him.
No amount of reading or meditation
at home can supply the pleasure derived
from visiting the famous places
of history, while the previous
reading creates the desire and predisposes
for the pleasure. Hence it
is that all students like so much to
travel, and to travel on foot.</p>

<p>Those who travel expensively
lose a great deal of the benefit and
interest of travel. The magnificent
hotels are filled with English and
Americans, principally those who
affect that rank and demand that
obsequiousness abroad to which
they could not aspire at home.
Many of them are very ignorant,
and the waiters, for their sake,
speak a mongrel kind of English,
which is simply unbearable when
it is not absolutely needed. The
latter affect English ways; and,
though you may desire to practise
your college French, German, or
Italian, they insultingly reply in
your own tongue, as if to spare you
any further exhibition of your ignorance,
and because their avarice
makes them more anxious to learn
English than that you should acquire
a foreign tongue. I asked
one of these servants once how
much I was to pay the hackman.
My question was in German, his
answer in English; but I was on the
point of paying thirty-six cents for
the lesson I gave him in our language,
as he told me to give the man
eighty-four kreutzers instead of forty-eight,
because he didn’t know
how to translate <i>acht und pfierzig</i>.
The tourist who, through his ignorance
of the language or his desire
of display, frequents these English
hotels, learns nothing of the languages,
nothing of the customs of
the people, scarcely anything of the
<i>cuisine</i>, but becomes a target for the
attacks of interpreters, guides, lying
<i>ciceroni</i>, and a host of hangers-on,
who impose on him in proportion to
his ignorance, and palm off falsehoods
on him suited to his bigoted
preconceptions on every subject. In
the drawing-room and at the table,
he may as well be at home in London
or New York, as far as language,
habits, etc., are concerned, and he
often leaves a country with less real
knowledge of it than he had before
he came.</p>

<p>The artist, the student, the gentleman
bachelor, who stroll about for
their own pleasure, and pay no unnecessary
homage to fashion or humbug&mdash;these
are the ones who derive
genuine pleasure from the novelty
and constant surprises of new customs,
languages, and people. I have
seen such persons, some of them
men of independent fortune, travelling
in omnibus or on foot about
Germany, Switzerland, and Italy.
They send their trunks on to some
known hotel in a place fifty miles
off, and then, carrying simply a
knapsack with necessaries for a few
days, take a stick and perhaps a
pencil and paper, and leisurely walk
along the fine roads of those countries,
meeting a village every few
miles, where they can take some refreshment,
or stay over night. This
is seeing a country, and knowing its
language, customs, people, by personal
observation, and not through
the uncertain medium of hotel guides.
And who would compare the restrained
formality of fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
moving about to the glorious freedom
of this? The students of the
English College at Rome used to
travel thus two or three together
during vacation, and spend the time
delightfully.</p>

<p>When visiting the ancient, interesting
city of Nürnberg last August&mdash;its
old castle where the peace of
Westphalia was signed, and where
many of the Western emperors resided;
its curious walls and fortifications;
its old mediæval houses, with
six stories, under an oblique roof; its
curious fountains; and the residence
of Albrecht Dürer&mdash;I entered a magnificent
temple of old Catholic times,
that of S. Lawrence, now devoted
to Lutheran worship. All the crucifixes,
pictures, and statuary with
the altars still remain; for Luther
was a much more intelligent man
than many who imitated his rebellion.
I was admiring the tabernacle
of marble tracery, which reaches
from the pavement seventy feet up
to the roof along one of the pillars,
and is the most exquisite piece of
poetry in miniature stone I ever saw,
when my attention was drawn to
two students, boys of sixteen or
seventeen, who were likewise visiting
the church. They were very plainly
dressed; for the old Catholic universities
are free in Europe, and good
conduct only is required as a condition
of membership. On their backs,
they had knapsacks with straps coming
over the shoulders, and containing
doubtless a change of clothing,
while the long German pipe was
seen stuck into the bundle. They
carried sticks in their hands, and one
had a guide-book, and was reading
therefrom, and pointing out to his
companion the objects of interest existing
in the church. I watched the
boys with great interest, and felt
how happy they were in their simple
manners and pure friendship&mdash;happy
in the possession of knowledge more
than if they had the Rothschilds’
wealth or Bismarck’s power; they
were in love with and betrothed to
wisdom, and independent of the
world. Walking about afterwards
round the great moat and curious
turreted walls of this famous town, I
came across my two friends, seated
on a bench in the shaded, turf-set
promenade which girds part of the
city, taking their frugal meal of the
inevitable sausage and brown bread
of the country. Thus they strolled
about from town to town, living
plainly and simply as their means&mdash;the
gift, perhaps, of some patron&mdash;required,
but happy in the
banquet which their own erudition
and friendship provided. I have
seen many travellers, and they have
remained longer or shorter in my
memory; but the picture of the
two students of Nürnberg will remain
with me always.</p>

<p>Among those who travel we
may include that class so numerous
in our own day in proportion
to the increase of the enemies
of the supernatural&mdash;those who, to
satisfy their devotion, visit holy places.
The sight of persons or localities
associated with supernatural
events or with the lives of those
whose heroic sanctity we venerate,
impresses us beings of half spiritual,
half corporeal formation in a wonderful
degree. I need not dilate on
this. It is the reason why, in all
ages, such multitudes have traversed
land and sea, spent years even of
their lives in visiting the Holy Land,
Rome, Loretto, Compostella. That
they obtained pleasure and sensible
satisfaction you may easily imagine;
and that they aided the faith by supplying
constant information relative
to the locality of sacred events, and
thus kept up the strength of tradition,
cannot be denied; but I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
console those whose responsible care
of family or office, whose want of
means or leisure, prevent their assuming
the pilgrim’s scrip and staff,
with the words of Thomas à Kempis:
<i>Qui multum peregrinantur, raro
sanctificantur</i>.</p>

<p>There is so much to distract one
in the strangeness and novelty of
foreign places, so much disturbance
of order in one’s manner of life, that,
as a rule, one is likely to come home
less single-minded and less edifying
than when he set out. However, I
must bear witness to an exception,
though it is not calculated to be an
example for any one here. It is
that of a Frenchman, a youth of
twenty, dressed in the national
blouse (as a duster in the cars over
a decent suit of black), whom I met
on the way to the famous shrine of
Lourdes. His faith was so simple,
his modesty so perfect, his tongue so
<i>straight</i> (to use an Indian idiom),
that I felt that the true Christian is
gentlemanly no matter to what class
of society he may belong. I was
confounded and ashamed when I
compared my faith and hope with
his, and knew that for the first time
I addressed a man who had never
breathed the atmosphere of heresy
and unbelief, who had never felt a
doubt or recognized a difficulty regarding
the truths of religion or the
pious beliefs of Catholics. Reflecting
on the difference between what
is termed “the world” in all the
conceitedness of its ignorance, and
the class whom he represented, I
could not wonder that God should
show his preference for the simple,
truthful people even by the most
stupendous miracles. However, he
was still in France. Were he on
an American railroad-car, he might
have allowed some of the mire of
the world to adhere to his garments.</p>

<p>I will not rest long on the subject
of the Lourdes pilgrimage, as the entire
press has been forced to notice
it, and has given full reports of the
appearance of the shrine, the gatherings
of pilgrims, and the wondrous
works. Although the people of the
village are said to be gradually losing
their simple, amiable qualities, on account
of the enlivened trade and
the continual distraction consequent
on the arrival and departure of perhaps
a thousand strangers daily in a
village of 2,000 inhabitants, yet we
could not help remarking the piety
of the matrons, the modesty of the
maidens, and the straightforwardness
of the men&mdash;characteristics more refreshing
to us than the breezes coming
down from the passes of the
Pyrenees. It is delightful to get out
of an artificial state of society, and to
see men and women as God made
them. I will have occasion to refer
to this subsequently when I speak
of the Irish people. The peasantry
of Lourdes, whom God chose for this
manifestation, are poor but not slovenly,
simple but not uncouth, comparatively
illiterate but not ignorant.
Education is not at all incompatible
with ignorance of reading
and writing; while barbarism is not
seldom found united with these accidental
accomplishments.</p>

<p>One evening, having prayed at
the famous grotto, which was most
exquisitely decorated with candles
supplied by the pilgrims, we strolled
toward a farm-house, and, seeing
some peasants just finishing their
day’s labor, stopped and addressed
them. Lord Chesterfield would
have been charmed to see the ease
and grace with which the farmer
rose from his task, and inquired our
pleasure. His conversation was
pure, straight, and full of faith. He
spoke of things miraculous just as he
did of other events, evidently not
thinking how people can question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
God’s power, or wonder at his goodness.
He had been one of that
20,000 who at times witnessed the
ecstasies of Bernadette; and, after describing
what he saw, he concluded:
“Ah! sirs, who ever visits that
grotto treads blessed earth.” My
friend complimented him on the
purity of his language, and the politeness
he had shown us, and which,
indeed, we strangers scarce expected
from one in his dress and employment.
“Why,” said he, “gentlemen,
if you take kindness and good grace
out of the world, after all, what is
there worth living for?” We were
charmed. There spoke a Frenchman&mdash;one
of those who made some
one say: “They are a nation of
gentlemen.” We visited his poor
habitation, and were still more pleased
with his filial and conjugal affection,
as evidenced by his regard for his
wife, and care of his bedridden mother.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> of this subject of travelling
for pleasure, it was very beautiful
to watch from a height the pilgrims,
1,500 in number, winding
around the road, crossing the bridge,
and going down the hillside to the
grotto. First came the cross-bearer
with the crucifix shining in the sun,
then the women and children in the
dark dresses which distinguish the
inhabitants of the region. Some of
them bore lighted candles; others
carried baskets on their arms and
heads; others had jars containing
wine for their lunch, or intended to
be filled with the miraculous water.
They sang the Litany of Loretto,
some priests along the ranks directing,
as they walked in double file.
After these came the men; then the
altar boys in full dress, and thirty or
forty in number; then the clerics,
priests, and canons in their robes;
and finally the Bishop of Perpignan,
in sacred vestments, who had thus
come with his people to visit the
spot favored by the Immaculate Virgin.
I never before saw the expression,
“The bishop and his flock,”
more perfectly illustrated.</p>

<p>We were particularly struck by
the behavior of these people in the
church&mdash;a beautiful marble structure
built on the rock, under the side of
which the waves of the passing river
had formed the grotto. They had
none of the superstitious reverence
of Mahometans nor the cold decency
of Protestants; but acted with
that quiet respect, alike remote from
fear and levity, which characterizes
well-reared children in their father’s
house and presence. After
performing their devotions with intense
faith and childlike fervor, they
sat down before the grotto, on the
sweet level bank of the river which
skirts the rock, and, in a spirit of
Christian recreation, began their frugal
lunch.</p>

<p>So familiar are fervent Catholics
with the wonderful works of God
that they who can talk and laugh
when the communion thanksgiving
is ended found no difficulty in innocent
relaxation after paying their
respects and perhaps witnessing miracles
at the shrine consecrated by the
apparition of Mary. They reminded
me of the <i>αγαπη</i> of the first Christians,
and of the feast we school-boys
used to have long ago, after closing
our retreat with receiving the body
of Jesus Christ; and I could not but
acknowledge that these people were
most likely to be favored with supernatural
manifestations by him who
said: “Unless you become as little
children, you shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven.”</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">FROM THE FRENCH OF M. L’ABBE CASGRAIN.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;DETROIT.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Are</span> you familiar with that fertile,
laughing country, so rich in historical
souvenirs, whose virgin soil
was first trodden by our French
ancestors? Are you familiar with
these green and undulating prairies,
watered by limpid streams, and shaded
by maples, plane-trees, figs, and
acacias, in the midst of which rises,
brilliant in youth and prospective
greatness, the flourishing city of
Detroit? If you wish to enjoy fully
the enchanting picture that this
charming country presents&mdash;whose
climate need not be envious of the
Italian sun&mdash;ascend the Detroit River
some fresh spring morning, when
Aurora has shaken her dewy wings
over these vast plains, and when the
bright May sun has thrown its luminous
rays through the transparent
mists of morning. Nowhere is
there a clearer sky or more ravishing
nature. Nowhere are the wavy
lines of the blue horizon more distinctly
traced. Here are wild and
uncultivated sites, romantic landscapes,
little wooded islands, like
baskets of verdure, all re-echoing
the mocking laughter of multitudes
of birds. Pretty promontories whose
round arms encircle gulfs full of
shadows and sunlight; whose waves,
caressed by these warm breaths,
deposit along the shore a fringe of
silver foam. Hills and valleys, covered
with luxuriant verdure, mirror
themselves in the neighboring wave.
On either side the shore stretches
along, covered with pebbles or fine
gray sand; sometimes embroidered
with a lace-like turf, or bristling
with tall reeds, crowned with little
tufts, among which the timid kingfishers
perch, and take flight at the
least noise. Here the fresh murmuring
rivulets flow under the flowery
arches of interlacing boughs; there
tiny paths, edged with strawberries
and forget-me-nots, wind over the
brow of the hill; and, more distant,
the fresh spring zephyr trembles on
the green meadows, and perfumes
the air with a delicious fragrance.
The thousand confused noises of
the water and the rustling foliage,
the warbling of birds, the buzz of
human voices, the lowing of herds,
and the distant and silvery echo of
the bells of the steamers that ply
along the river, ascend from time to
time through the air, and diffuse an
indefinable charm in the soul and
through the senses. At short distances
apart, pretty little villages
stretch along the shore, or group
themselves on the banks of a stream,
or again on the slope of a hill, or
crowning its summit like a diadem.
Finally you arrive at Detroit, with
its steeples and roofs glittering in
the sunlight. Hundreds of boats,
engaged in commercial interests, are
constantly arriving at or leaving
its quays, furrowing the river in
every direction. Were I a poet, I
would compare this charming city
to the superb swan of this country,
which, on awakening in the midst of
the rushes on the river’s bank, shakes
its white wings in taking flight, and
showers around a rain of dew and
down; or, better still, to the stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
magnolia growing on the banks of
the stream, when, shaken by the
aromatic breath of the morning
breeze, it covers the wave in which
it is mirrored with the fertile dust of
its corolla.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;THE PIONEER.</h3>

<p class="p1">Founded in the year 1700, by
M. de la Mothe-Cadillac, Detroit remained
for a long time under the
Canadian government. It was taken
by the English in 1760, and remained
in their possession until the war
of 1812. Then the United States
became the happy possessor of this
charming country, which F. Charlevoix
has so justly called “the garden
spot.” “Detroit,” says the Canadian
historian, “has preserved, in spite of
its many vicissitudes, the characteristics
of its origin, and French is still
the language of a large portion of its
population. Like all the cities founded
and settled by this great people&mdash;the
monuments of whose genius are
landmarks in America&mdash;Detroit is
destined to become a great business
centre, on account of its favorable
situation between Lake Huron and
Lake Erie.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Toward the year
1770 or 1780, Detroit was far from
presenting the flourishing aspect
which it offers to the stranger to-day.
It was only a small fort surrounded
by weak ramparts, and a stockade
in which lived a few hundred Canadian
colonists&mdash;a veritable tent in the
wilderness. The fort was the advanced
sentinel of the colony, and
by consequence constantly exposed
to the attacks of the Indians. Around
the fortifications the colonists had
cleared a few acres of land, which
they could only cultivate at the risk
of their lives, holding a pickaxe in
one hand, and a gun in the other;
while beyond, before, behind, to the
right, to the left, everywhere a wilderness,
everywhere interminable forests,
whose gloomy shades concealed
multitudes of beings a thousand times
more cruel, a thousand times more
formidable and to be feared, than
the wild beasts and reptiles which
shared alike the tenebrious shelter.
It is easy from this to imagine what
indomitable courage these hardy pioneers
possessed who dared to come
and plant the standard of civilization
in the midst of these distant solitudes,
in the face of such multitudinous
perils. One of the grandest pictures
that the history of the New World
presents, after the sublime figure of
the missionary, is that of the Canadian
pioneer. He is the father of
the strongest race that has been
implanted on the American continent&mdash;the
Canadian race; and the
noblest blood that has ever flowed
in human veins, flows through his&mdash;the
French blood. Everywhere on
the continent the Canadian pioneer
is to be found, and everywhere can
be traced by his blood. Travel
through North America, from Hudson’s
Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, from
Halifax to San Francisco, and on the
snows of the North Pole and the
golden sands of California, along the
Atlantic strand, and on the moss-covered
slopes of the Rocky Mountains,
you will find the print of his
footsteps. An insatiable activity consumes
him. Onward! is his watchword,
and he only rests when he
has reached the goal of his ambition.
But it is not alone the love of adventure
nor the violent thirst for gold
that stimulates him to action: a nobler
ambition urges him on, a more
legitimate instinct animates and
guides him. He has a mission to accomplish&mdash;a
mysterious apostleship.
Turn for a moment to the pages of
our history, and especially to the
accounts of the Jesuits, and you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
see the Canadian pioneer throughout
animated by the most admirable zeal
for the conversion of the savages,
opening a way for the missionaries
by the most heroic efforts, and frequently
himself making the most
wonderful conversions. We find
united in him the three grandest
types of manhood: priest, laborer,
soldier. Priest!&mdash;by his ardent piety,
his lively faith, his zeal for the salvation
of vacillating souls and obdurate
hearts, drawing to the faith entire
settlements. Was there ever a
more admirable priesthood? Laborer!&mdash;before
his powerful axe the
great forests fall with a crash around
him, and his plough tracks, through
the fallen trunks, the furrow where
the green germ of the future harvest
will soon begin to tremble. Soldier!&mdash;by
years of mortal combat, he has
conquered the soil that his hand cultivates.
Ah! were I only an artist,
to trace on canvas this noble figure
in his triple character of priest, laborer,
and soldier. In the background
of the picture, immense forests,
in all their savage grandeur;
nearer, the waving grain, growing between
the charred trunks. In the
foreground, a portion of the great
river, with its emerald waves sparkling
in the sun. On one side, an
angle of the old fort, with its ramparts
and stockade, whence rises a
modest little belfry surmounted by a
cross. On the other side, a band of
Indians flying toward the edge of
the wood. The centre-piece would
be my brave pioneer, his eyes flashing,
his hair blown by the breeze,
and his forehead bleeding from a
ball which had just grazed it, near
him his plough, and holding his gun,
whose muzzle still smokes from a recent
conflict. At the right, he would
be pouring the water of baptism on
the head of his vanquished and dying
enemy, whom he had just converted
to the faith. Oh! how could
I attempt to paint this vigorous
figure in the various attitudes of a
soldier-laborer, with his iron muscles,
and the calm, serene strength
of the man of the fields; the invincible
courage of the soldier, and the
sublime enthusiasm of the priest!
Verily, this picture would not be unworthy
of the pencil of a Rubens or
a Michael Angelo. Faith, toil, courage;
priest, laborer, soldier&mdash;this is
the Canadian pioneer. It is Cincinnatus,
the soldier-laborer, become a
Christian. It is the Spartan warrior,
who has passed through the Catacombs.
The Canadian reader who
peruses these lines can raise his head
with noble pride, for the blood that
flows through his veins is the blood
of heroes. He can look attentively
at the palm of his hand, and see
there still the unction of earth, of
powder, and of the priesthood. The
pioneer has nobly filled his mission:
yours remains to be accomplished.
A people to whom God has given
such ancestors is necessarily destined
for something great, if it faithfully
corresponds with the designs of divine
Providence. But let us leave
these teachings, which properly belong
to venerable heads, and return
to our story.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;EVENING.</h3>

<p class="p1">At the remote period which we
describe, the fur trade of Detroit was
immense; and the Indians, aided and
encouraged by the facilities for reaching
there, came in great numbers
to sell the products of their hunting
expeditions. There were representatives
from the various tribes&mdash;Iroquois,
Potawatamies, Illinois, Miamis,
and a host of others. M. Jacques
Du Perron Baby was at that time
Indian superintendent at Detroit.
This was an extremely important and
responsible position at that period.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
M. Baby had realized a handsome
fortune there in a few years. Almost
all the land on which the Detroit of
to-day stands was then owned by
him and a Mr. Macomb, the father
of General Macomb, who commanded
a portion of the American troops
during the war of 1812. At the
close of this war, the entire property
of M. Baby was confiscated in consequence
of his political opinions,
which were declared in favor of
Canada <i>versus</i> the United States.
His fine mansion stood in the centre
of the fort, surrounded by a beautiful
garden. Having luxurious tastes, he
embellished it with all the requirements
of refined and cultivated life.
The garden was on raised ground,
surrounded by a sodded terrace; the
house stood in the centre, half concealed
by a dense foliage of maple,
pear, and acacia trees, which waved
their branches coaxingly over its
roof. A number of birds, sometimes
hidden in the branches, sometimes
flying through the air, crossing, pursuing
each other, describing a thousand
bewildering circles, abandoned
themselves to joyous song, while the
little <i>ramoneur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> complaining on the
chimney-top, mingled his shrill,
harsh cry with their melodious voices.
It was evening. The last rays of the
setting sun colored with rose and
saffron tints the tops of the forests.
The heat had been intense throughout
the day. The evening breeze,
coquetting among the roses, dahlias,
and flowering eglantine, refreshed
exhausted nature deliciously, and
perfumed the air with the most intoxicating
fragrance. Tea was about
being served in the garden, and the
table was most invitingly covered
with tempting viands and lovely
flowers. The superintendent and his
family were seated around; a young
officer who had been several months
in Detroit had been invited to join
the family party. Two colored servants
waited most assiduously at the
repast. “What a charming evening!”
said the officer&mdash;he was a handsome
young man, with light hair, noble
and expressive features, and rather a
high forehead. There was a proud,
intelligent expression in his bright
eyes, and yet at times something
vague and dreamy. “Truly,” he continued,
“I have never seen anything
in Italy more delightful than this;
such a climate, and such ravishing
scenery, such fine effects of light and
shade! Look there along the horizon,
and at those fleecy clouds which
float through the azure sky; they resemble
a superb scarf fringed with
purple and gold.”</p>

<p>“It is indeed a magnificent evening,”
replied the superintendent.
“We really enjoy a very fine climate
in this section of country. I have
never seen anywhere a clearer sky or
more transparent atmosphere, and
nature so grand; but, against all of
this, we are deprived of nearly all of
the luxuries and comforts of the old
country, to say nothing of the constant
dangers to which we are exposed
from the Indians; for we are on
the utmost limits of civilization.
You, who have just left the civilized
shores of Europe, can scarcely form
any idea of the cruelty of these barbarians.
Life is indeed very severe
in this new country.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his wife, whose fine physiognomy
indicated her great force of
character; “it is only a few years ago
that I was obliged to do sentinel duty,
and stand at the entrance of the fort
with a gun in my hand, while the
men were occupied in cultivating
the fields around it.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
by one of the servants, who came to
say that a stranger was waiting to
see the superintendent and his wife.
They all arose from the tea-table.</p>

<p>“You look very sad this evening,
mademoiselle,” said the officer, addressing
a young girl of sixteen or
eighteen years of age, and who, from
a strong resemblance, could be easily
recognized as the daughter of
M. Baby. “What can have happened
to cause such a shadow to fall on
your fair brow; while all are smiling
around you, your heart seems full of
sorrow? It is almost impossible
that any one could contemplate this
lovely scene, and not experience a
feeling of interior peace. Nothing
so completely bewilders me like an
evening of this kind. This graceful
harmony of light and shade is for
me full of a mysterious intoxication.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the young girl, “a
few days ago I too could have enjoyed
this scene; but to-day, as it
were, every object is covered with a
funereal pall. This beautiful sky,
these green fields, the flowers and
fruit, these vermilion roses, which
charm your sight, all make me
shudder. I see blood everywhere.”</p>

<p>“My God!” cried the officer, “what
misfortune can have happened to
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! only a few hours ago, I
witnessed such a distressing scene
that it is impossible to imagine it.
I cannot obliterate it from my mind,
or distract my thoughts in the least
from the shocking spectacle. But I
ought not to distress you by this sorrowful
recital. I had rather let you
enjoy tranquilly these hours that
afford you so much pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Continue, continue,” exclaimed
he. “Relate to me this tragic story.
Happiness is often so selfish, but we
should always have our sympathies
ready for the sorrows of others.”</p>

<p>The young girl then continued:
“Day before yesterday evening, a
party of Indians half intoxicated
came into the fort to see my father;
they brought with them a young
girl, whom they had captured several
days before. Oh! if you could only
have seen the despair on her countenance!
Poor child, her clothes
were in rags, her hair hung in tangled
masses, and her face was all
scratched and bleeding. She did
not utter a complaint, nor did she
weep; but stood with fixed eyes,
mute and immovable as a statue.
We might have believed her dead
but for a slight trembling of the lips
that betrayed the life that was not
visible. It was a fearful sight. I
have never seen anything like it.
Great misfortunes are like severe
wounds; they dry up our tears as
terrible and sudden wounds arrest
the blood in our veins. Compassionating
her distressed situation, my
sister and myself made her come in
and stay in our room through the
night; but we did not deceive ourselves
with the slightest hope that
anything could be done for her
rescue, for we knew too well the
character of these savages. Nevertheless,
we tried to sustain her with
a little hope that something might
possibly be done. Perhaps our father
could succeed in inducing the
Indians to let her go. At last she
gradually recovered from her state
of stupor, and told us her sad, sad
story.”</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;AGONY.</h3>

<p class="p1">“I have lived for some time,” said
she, “near Fort Wayne with my married
sister. One morning, while her
husband was at work in the field,
several Indians suddenly entered our
house. ‘Where is your husband?’
they inquired roughly of my sister.
‘He is at Fort Wayne,’ she replied,
frightened by their sinister aspect; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
they went out again. Full of anxiety,
we followed them with our eyes for
some time. ‘O my God! sister,’ exclaimed
I, trembling, ‘I am so frightened,
so terrified. Let us fly; these
savages appear to me to be meditating
some dreadful act. I am convinced
that they will return.’ Without
paying any attention to my
words, she continued to watch them
as they went off in the direction of
Fort Wayne. The road which they
took lay only a short distance from
the place where her husband was
quietly at work, not having the
slightest idea of the danger that
threatened him. Fortunately, a
clump of trees hid him from their
sight. We began to breathe more
freely, for they had now gone beyond
the field; but suddenly one
of them happened to turn around.
‘They have discovered him! they
have discovered him!’ shrieked my
sister, almost fainting with terror.
And really they had all stopped, and
were looking in the direction where
Joseph was stooping down, gathering
up the branches of a tree which
he had just cut down. He had no
suspicion of danger. The Indians,
concealed by the trees, were now
only a short distance off. Suddenly
we heard the report of a gun, and
Joseph fell to the ground. Believing
him dead, they advanced boldly;
but the ball had only grazed his
head, and he was stunned for the
moment. He quickly recovered
himself, and, making a breastwork of
the branches of the felled tree, seized
his gun, and in an instant two of
them were stretched stiff corpses on
the ground. The others, alarmed,
made a precipitate retreat toward
the edge of the woods, and then a
quick firing commenced on both
sides. Joseph was a fine marksman;
at each shot, he disabled an enemy.
Three had already fallen. We
awaited, in an agony of apprehension,
the result of the mortal combat,
which would not have been doubtful
had it been only an ordinary enemy
that the savages had to contend with.
But Joseph was a formidable adversary.
He fired rapidly, reloading his
gun with the most perfect coolness,
while the balls were whistling all
around him. Placing the muzzle of
his gun between the branches, he
made the sign of the cross on his
breast at the moment of taking aim;
then, pulling the trigger, we counted
another Indian less. Every time I
saw a new victim fall, I could not
repress a tremor of delight. Joseph’s
unerring ball had just struck a fourth
enemy. We began to hope, when
we discovered one of the savages
creeping along on the ground behind
him. No serpent could have
advanced with more cunning or address.
Without shaking a pebble
or disturbing a leaf, he approached
slowly; at one time concealing himself
behind a little knoll, then under
a thicket of brambles, only exposing
himself when he saw Joseph busy
taking aim. Finally he arrived within
two steps of him without being
seen. Then, stopping, he waited
until Joseph had reloaded his gun.
Without suspecting the danger behind
him, he raised his gun to his
shoulder to take aim; then we saw
him lower it quickly, and look
around. He had heard a slight
noise in the bushes near him. He
raised his head and listened an
instant, then leaned toward the
right, and then toward the left, without
perceiving anything; for the savage
was lying flat on the ground, behind
a pile of branches. Feeling entirely
reassured, he again raised his gun to
take aim. At the same moment, the
Indian, with an infernal smile, raised
himself from the earth, and, just as
Joseph was preparing to immolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
another enemy, he brandished his
knife. A last shot was heard, a last
Indian fell; but Joseph had also fallen,
struck to the heart by the cowardly
fiend. The wretch then proceeded
to scalp him, after which he plundered
him of his clothes, in which
he arrayed himself.”</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;LAMENTATION.</h3>

<p class="p1">“Paralyzed with horror and fright,
we thought no longer of saving ourselves.
My sister, in her despair,
pressed her baby to her heart, and
threw herself at the foot of a crucifix,
which she seized in her hands,
and mutely covered it with tears and
kisses, while I, too, utterly overcome,
threw myself on my knees beside her,
and mingled my tears and prayers
with hers. Poor mother! she did not
tremble for herself, but for her child&mdash;that
dear little angel, whom she loved
so tenderly, whom she so adored.
It was indeed a beautiful babe,
scarcely eighteen months old, and
had already begun to lisp ‘Mamma.’
‘O my God!’ cried my sister between
her sobs, ‘if I must die, I willingly
give up my life; but save, oh! save my
child!’ Then, embracing it, and bathing
it in her tears, she clasped it
to her heart, and sank to the floor
insensible. Although more dead than
alive myself, I tried to sustain her,
and had her in my arms, when Joseph’s
murderer entered, followed by
his cruel companions. Without uttering
a word, he advanced toward
us, and violently snatched the child
from its mother. She had not heard
them enter the room, but, when they
tore the child away from her, she
shuddered and suddenly recovered
her consciousness. The savages, exasperated
at having lost seven of
their comrades, now only thought of
blood and vengeance. The assassin
of Joseph, holding the child at arm’s
length, looked at it with the diabolical
expression of a serpent charming
his victim before striking him. It
was an angel in the grasp of a demon.
The monster smiled&mdash;Satan
alone could have laughed as he did.
The baby, as if to supplicate his pity,
smiled also, with that angelic expression
of innocence that would have
moved the most hardened and obdurate
of hearts. But he, seizing it by
the leg, whirled it round for an instant,
and then&mdash;oh! horror!&mdash;dashed
its head against the heavy edge of
the huge stove. Its brains spattered
over its mother’s face. Like a tiger
she sprang at the murderer of her
child. Maternal love gave her
superhuman strength, and, seizing
him by the throat, she buried her
fingers in his flesh. He tottered;
his face turned black, and he
fell heavily to the floor, suffocated by
the strength of her desperate grasp.
She would have undoubtedly strangled
him, had not another savage at
that instant struck her a blow on the
head with his hatchet. My poor
sister! her death was indeed a cruel
one, but her agony only lasted a
moment&mdash;her troubles are ended,
and she is now in heaven. But I&mdash;what
will become of me? You see
the condition that I am in. O my
God, my God! have pity on me.”</p>

<p>And the young girl, wringing her
hands in despair, threw herself sobbing
into my arms, pressed me to her
heart, and implored me not to abandon
her into the hands of these brutal
savages. But, oh! what is more
heart-breaking than to witness misfortune
without the power of alleviating
it! We spent the night in
weeping and trying to encourage her,
but I could not help feeling at the
time that it was cruel to inspire her
with a confidence that I had not; for
I knew these savages too well. I knew
that the monsters never abandoned
their victims. The next day, my father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
tried in every way to conciliate them,
and then interceded in behalf of the
young captive. He offered any
amount of ransom for her, but in
vain; nothing would tempt them.
The effects of the liquor had not entirely
worn off, and they were sullen
and obstinate. My father used in
turn prayers and threats to move
them; but neither presents, prayers,
nor threats could rescue her from their
merciless hands. The wretched girl
threw herself at their feet, and, embracing
their knees, besought them
to listen to her supplications; but the
monsters only replied to her entreaties
by bursts of laughter; and, in
spite of her prayers, and sobs, and
supplications, they carried her off
with them.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>“Alas!” said Mlle. Baby, looking
sorrowfully at the young officer, “are
you surprised now at my sadness,
and that I could not smile and be
gay after having witnessed such a
scene?”</p>

<p>“The demons!” exclaimed the officer,
stamping his foot in horror and
indignation. “This infamous, bloodthirsty
race should be exterminated&mdash;exterminated
to the last man. Why
did I not know this sooner? Yesterday,
a Potawatamie came to my quarters
to sell some furs. He asked three
times as much as they were worth, and
I declined buying them. He hung
around for some time, annoying me
very much, until I finally ordered him
to leave. He refused to do so; then,
losing all patience with the fellow, I
rose from my seat, and, leading him to
the door, I kicked him out. He went
away muttering, and threatening me
with his knife. I had a stick in my
hand, and I now regret that I did
not knock him down.”</p>

<p>“How imprudent!” said the young
girl. “You ought not to have provoked
that Indian; don’t you know that a
savage never forgets an injury? He
may wander around the fort for a
year, spying all of your movements,
watching your footsteps, tracking you
everywhere, hiding in the woods
and among the rushes in the river,
until an opportunity offers, and he
will approach with all the <i>finesse</i>
and cunning of a serpent, spring upon
you like a tiger, and strike you a
death-blow, when you least expect
it. I see that you go every day out
of the fort to fish on the banks of
the river. I advise you not to go
any more; it is not safe, and something
terrible might happen to you.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said the young officer,
“you are too timid. I saw the
fellow leave this morning with a
number of warriors belonging to his
tribe; they were going to Quebec to
sell the furs, which they could not
dispose of here.”</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;THE DREAM.</h3>

<p class="p1">The clock in the <i>salon</i> had just
struck one. Mme. Baby and her
daughter were seated sewing in the
deep recess of an open window, with
a little work-table in front of them.
M. Baby had gone away that morning,
to look after some land that he
had just bought on the other side of
the river. The streets were deserted;
nearly all the inhabitants of the fort
were at work in the fields in the
vicinity. The heat was intense.
Not a breath agitated the trees in the
garden, whose motionless branches
drooped languidly toward the earth,
as if imploring a refreshing breath
or a drop of dew. A negro servant
was spreading some linen out to dry
on the bushes, and put to flight, in
her perambulations, some chickens
that were panting with the heat
under the sheltering foliage of the
trees and shrubs. The silence was
only broken by the buzzing of insects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
and the noisy whirr of the grasshopper
as it danced through the sunlight.
The open window, filled with bouquets,
looked into the garden, and
the pale, melancholy face of Mlle.
Baby could be seen between them,
bending over an open flower which
imaged her loveliness in its fragrant
corolla. “Mamma,” said she at
last, raising her head, “do you think
papa will be away a long time?”</p>

<p>“I think he will be back in four or
five days at the latest,” replied her
mother. “But why do you ask such
a question?”</p>

<p>“Oh! because I am so anxious
to have him back again. I want
him to take us immediately to
Quebec, instead of waiting until
next month. The trip will divert my
thoughts; for, since those Indians
were here the other day with that
poor girl they had captured, I have
not had a moment’s piece of mind.
She is always before my eyes. I see
her everywhere; she follows me
everywhere. I even saw her in my
dream last night. I thought I was
sitting in the midst of a gloomy and
immense forest, near a wild, rushing
river that dashed over a precipice
into a bottomless chasm a few steps
from me. On the opposite bank,
which was covered with flowers, and
charming to behold, stood the young
captive, pale and tranquil, in a halo
of soft, transparent light. She seemed
to be in another world. She
held in her hands an open book,
and, bending towards me, she slowly
turned over the leaves. She turned
at least sixteen; then she stopped
and looked at me with an expression
of the greatest sorrow and distress,
and made a sign to some one, who
then seemed to be standing near
me, to cross the torrent. At the
signal, all his limbs trembled; his
knees knocked together, and his eyes
dilated, his mouth gasped with terror,
and a cold perspiration stood upon his
forehead. He tried to draw back,
but an invincible power drew him
toward the abyss. He turned toward
me, and besought my help most
piteously. I experienced the greatest
commiseration for him, and tried
in vain to extend my hands to help
him; invisible cords bound all my
limbs, and prevented any movement
whatsoever. Vainly he tried to cling
to the cliffs along the shore; a relentless
force impelled him towards
the abyss. He had already reached
the middle of the stream, whose
deep and foaming waters roared
around him, as if impatient to swallow
him up. He tottered at every
step, and came near losing his equilibrium;
but, rallying his strength, he
struggled on. At last a great wave
broke over him, and he lost his
balance. His feet slipped; he looked
toward me with a glance of the
most inexpressible anguish, and fell.
In an instant, he was borne to the
brink of the precipice; he threw out
his hands, and grasped at a piece of
rock that jutted out of the water,
burying his fingers in the green and
slimy moss which covered it. For
an instant, he hung on with the
strength of despair; his body, stopped
suddenly in its precipitate course, appeared
for an instant above the waves.
The foam and spray enveloped it like a
cloud, and the wind from the fall blew
through his dank and dripping hair.
His dilated eyes were fastened on
the rock, which little by little receded
from his convulsive grasp.
Finally, with a terrible shriek, he disappeared
in the yawning gulf below.
Transfixed with agony and
horror, I looked across at the young
captive; but she, without uttering a
word, wiped away a tear, and silently
pointed to the last page in the
book, which seemed to me to be
covered with blood. I screamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
aloud with fright, and awoke with a
start. My God! will it be a page in
my life?”</p>

<h3>VII.&mdash;BLOOD.</h3>

<p class="p1">Scarcely had Mlle. Baby finished
speaking, when the sound of hasty
footsteps was heard at the door,
and a man, covered with blood, and
with a terrified look, rushed in. It
was the young officer. His right
arm was broken, and hanging at his
side.</p>

<p>“Hide me quickly,” cried he. “I
am pursued by the Indians.”</p>

<p>“Up in the attic, quick,” said Mme.
Baby to him, “and do not stir for your
life.”</p>

<p>In another moment, the savages
had entered the room; but, before
they could say a word, Mme.
Baby pointed to the next street, and
they went out again quickly, believing
that the officer had escaped in
that direction. The admirable composure
of Mme. Baby had completely
deceived them. Not a muscle of
her face betrayed her excessive agitation,
and, happily, they did not
have time to notice the mortal pallor
of the young girl, who, still leaning
among the flowers on the window-sill,
had almost fainted away. It
was one of those moments of inexpressible
anguish when a chill like
death strikes the heart. Mme. Baby
hoped that the savages, fearing the
superintendent, would not dare to
force themselves into the house; and
yet, who could stop them if they
did, or who could foresee what
these barbarians, once having tasted
blood, might do? She hoped that
their fruitless efforts might induce
them to abandon their search, or, if
they persisted, that she would have
sufficient time to obtain help, in case
they again entered the house. Making
a sign to a servant who was at
work in the garden, she ordered him
to run as fast as he could, and notify
some men belonging to the fort of
the danger which threatened them.
Some anxious minutes elapsed, but
the savages did not return. “Do
you think they have really gone?”
asked the young girl, in a low tone.
A faint glimmer of hope appeared in
her countenance.</p>

<p>“Even if they should return,” answered
Mme. Baby, “they would
not dare ...”</p>

<p>She did not finish, but leaning toward
the window, she tried to catch
the sound of human voices which
were heard in the distance. Was it the
help that she expected, or was it the
voices of the Indians coming back?
She could not distinguish. The
sound drew nearer and nearer, and
became more distinct as it approached.
“They are our men,”
exclaimed Mlle. Baby. “Don’t you
hear the barking of our dog?” And
she drew a long breath of relief, as if
an immense weight had been taken
from her heart.</p>

<p>Mme. Baby did not reply; a
faint smile played over her lips.
She, too, had heard the dogs barking;
but another noise that she
knew only too well had also reached
her ears. Very soon the voices
became so distinct that it was impossible
to be deceived any longer.
“Here they are, here they are!”
shrieked the young girl, sinking into
a seat near the window, as the different-colored
feathers with which the
savages decorated their heads appeared
between the trees.</p>

<p>“Don’t tremble so,” said Mme.
Baby in a quiet voice to her daughter,
“or you will betray us. Look out of
the window, and don’t let them perceive
your emotion.”</p>

<p>Courage and coolness at a critical
moment are always admirable, but
when a woman possesses these qualities,
they are sublime. Calm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
impassive, without even rising from
her seat, Mme. Baby tranquilly continued
her work. The most practised
eye could not have detected
the smallest trace of emotion, the
least feverish excitement or agitation,
on her commanding and noble countenance.
A heroine’s heart beat in
her woman’s breast, and it was thus
that she awaited the arrival of the
savages. “Tell us where you have
concealed the white warrior,” cried
the first one who entered the room.
It was the Potawatamie whom the
young officer had so imprudently offended.
He was dripping with perspiration,
and out of breath with his
long and fatiguing quest. You could
see the rage and exasperation of
his disappointment in his ferocious
glances, his scowling brow, and the
excitement that made every feature
quiver.</p>

<p>“Comrade,” replied Mme. Baby,
in a tranquil tone of voice, “you
know the superintendent well; and,
if you have the misfortune to misbehave
in his house, you will get into
trouble.”</p>

<p>The Indian hesitated a moment,
then said, in a feigned mildness of
voice, “My white sister knows that
the Potawatamie loves peace, and that
he never makes the first attack. The
white warrior is on the war-path, or
the Potawatamie would not have pursued.”</p>

<p>“I have not hidden the white warrior,”
answered Mme. Baby. “It is
useless to search here; you had better
look elsewhere, or he will escape you.”</p>

<p>The Indian did not reply, but, looking
at Mme. Baby with a smile, he
pointed to a little stain on the floor
that no one but an Indian would
have discovered. But the sharp eye
of the savage had detected there a
trace of his enemy. It was a drop
of blood, which Mme. Baby had
taken the precaution to wipe away
most carefully. “My sister has told
the truth,” said the Indian, in an
ironical tone. “The white warrior has
not passed this way; that drop of
blood, I suppose, she put there to
persuade the Indian that she had
concealed the white warrior.” Then,
assuming a more serious tone, he
continued: “My sister, know well
that the Potawatamie will do the white
warrior no harm; only show us
where he is hidden, and we will go
away; we only want to take him
pris ...” He stopped, and, bending
his head forward, looked through an
open window at the other end of
the apartment; then, giving a hideous
yell, he rushed across the room, and
leaped out of the window that opened
into the garden. His ferocious
companions followed him, howling
like a troop of demons. Without
seeing what had happened, Mme.
Baby understood all. The young
officer, hearing the Indians return,
and believing himself lost, had the
imprudence to jump out of one of
the windows into the garden. He
ran toward a covered fountain in
the centre of the <i>parterre</i> to hide,
when the Indian perceived him.
How can I describe the scene which
followed? The pen drops from my
hand. In two bounds, they had
reached him, and one of the savages,
striking him a terrible blow with his
fist, sent him reeling to the ground.
He fell on his broken arm, and the
excruciating pain caused him to utter
a deep groan. They then seized
hold of him, and bound his hands
and feet. Poor young man! what
resistance could he make to his cruel
enemies, with a broken arm, and totally
disabled and weakened by the
loss of blood. He called for help,
but the echoes in the garden only
answered his cries, and redoubled
the horror of the scene. Mlle. Baby,
bereft of her senses, threw herself at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
her mother’s feet, and, hiding her
face on her knees, she covered her
ears with her hands, to shut out, if
possible, from sight and hearing the
frightful tragedy. While the rest of
the savages were tying their victim
down, the Potawatamie drew out his
knife, and deliberately commenced
to sharpen it on a stone. His face
betrayed no excitement whatever;
not even the horrible pleasure of gratifying
his vengeance, which caused
his heart to palpitate with an infernal
joy, could change his stoical countenance.
“My brother the white
warrior,” said he, continuing to whet
his knife with the utmost coolness,
“knows very well that he can insult
the Potawatamie with impunity, because
the Potawatamie is a coward,
and would rather run than fight....
Does my brother now wish to make
peace with his friend, the Potawatamie?
He can speak if he wishes, and
name his terms, for he is free.” Then,
suddenly assuming a ferocious air,
he straightened himself up, and, fixing
his inflamed eyes on the young
officer, said: “My brother the white
warrior can now chant his death-song,
because he must die.” And
brandishing his knife, he plunged it
into his throat, while another of
these monsters caught the blood in a
little copper kettle. The rest of the
savages then kicked and stamped
upon the body with the most infernal
yells and contortions. The death-rattle
of the poor victim, mingling
with these howls, reached the ears
of the young girl, and she shook in
a convulsion of horror. At last it all
ceased. The victim had been immolated.
Pushing aside the corpse
with his foot, the Potawatamie, followed
by his companions, came
again toward the house. “Ha! ha!
so you would not tell us where your
friend, the white warrior, was?” cried
the Indian, as he entered the room.
“Very well, since you love him so
much, you shall drink his blood.”
Mme. Baby, pale as a marble statue,
drew herself up firmly. “You can
kill me,” said she, “but you can
never make me drink it!” The
young girl had fainted, and was lying
at her mother’s feet. They seized
hold of Mme. Baby, and tried to
force open her mouth; but failing in
their efforts, they threw the contents
of the vessel in her face, and left the
house.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;THE SERPENT.</h3>

<p class="p1">Several months had elapsed since
the events had taken place which
we have just narrated. It was night.
In the centre of the garden, a simple
black cross had been erected on the
spot where the unfortunate young
man had been massacred. No inscription
revealed to the passer-by
either the name of the victim or the
fatal circumstances of his death. Alas!
it was written for ever in characters of
blood on the hearts of the family.
Every evening, the superintendent,
with his wife, children, and servants,
assembled at the foot of this cross, to
pray for the repose of the soul of his
unfortunate friend. On this especial
evening, all the family had as usual
visited the grave, and returned to the
house, except the young girl, who,
dressed in deep mourning, still remained
kneeling at the foot of the
sombre monument. She was very
pale, and there was an expression of
the most ineffable sadness on her face.
The evening dew had almost entirely
uncurled her long ringlets, which
now hung in disorder around her
cheeks. You might have mistaken her
for a statue of grief. From the clear,
high heaven above, the moon poured
floods of melancholy light. Its
dreamy rays fell on the sod at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
foot of the cross and on the face of
the young girl like a thought from
beyond the tomb&mdash;like a silent and
grateful sigh from the innocent victim
whose memory had left so tender
and anguishing an impression in
her soul. Her lips moved in ardent
prayer&mdash;prayer, that celestial solace
of the grief-stricken heart, the smile
of the angels through the tears of
earth. For a long time she thus
silently held communion with her
God, breathing out her prayers with
sighs and tears, as she knelt at the
foot of this cross, on the sod still
damp with the victim’s blood. At
last she rose, and was about to leave,
when, raising her eyes for a moment,
she thought she saw a shadow moving
across an opening in the wall
of a shed near by. A cloud, at that
moment passing over the moon, prevented
her from distinguishing what
the object was. She waited a moment
until the cloud had passed
over, when what was her astonishment
to see a human face in the
aperture! It must be a robber, she
thought, and yet she knew positively
that the gate was well secured. “He
will find himself nicely caught when
the servants come to lock up,” said
she to herself. By degrees, however,
the head was pushed more and more
through the air-hole, and gradually
emerged from the obscurity. At the
same moment, the moonlight fell
clear and full on the face. The young
girl actually shivered. She recognized
it but too well; it was impossible
to be mistaken. It was he; she
recognized perfectly his copper skin,
his hard, ferocious features, and his
yellowish eyes, rolling in their sockets.
It was indeed the Potawatamie,
the murderer of the young officer.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Her first thought was flight, but
an invincible curiosity fastened her
to the spot. The Indian continued
to work through the aperture; one
arm was already out, and he held
something in his hand which she
could not discern. He tried for a
long time to get through the air-hole,
which was too small for his
body. Finally, while making a last
effort, he suddenly turned his head,
and fixed his eyes with a very uneasy
expression on a little bush near
him. He seemed undecided what to
do; then, letting go the object, he rested
his hand on the ground, and, pushing
it against the earth with all his
strength, tried to force himself back
again through the hole. But his
broad shoulders, compressed on both
sides by the wall, held him like a
vice, and he could neither move one
way nor another. Then his uneasiness
increased, and he looked again
anxiously toward the bushes. A slight
rustling of the leaves was then perceptible,
and a small head emerged
slowly from the shadow of the
branches, and extended itself toward
the savage. It was a rattlesnake.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
Immovable and with fixed eyes, the
Indian watched the least movement
of the reptile, which advanced softly
and cautiously, as if aware of the
strength and power of his redoubtable
adversary. When within a few feet
of the savage, it stopped, raised itself
up, and, throwing out its forked tongue,
sprang toward his face; but, before he
could touch him, the Indian, as quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
as thought, gave him a violent blow
with the hand that was free, and the
reptile fell a short distance from him.
Then he began again to make every
effort to disengage himself; but in
vain. The snake, now furious, advanced
a second time to recommence
the attack, but with more caution
than before. Approaching still nearer
to his enemy, he threw himself
forward with much greater
violence, but without success; for the
hand of the savage sent him rebounding
further off than before. The
Potawatamie then gathered all his
strength for a final effort of liberation,
but of no avail: he remained
fast in the opening of the air-hole.
Quick as lightning, the reptile, now
foaming at the mouth, with blazing
eyes, and jaws swollen with rage, his
forked tongue extended, sprang with
renewed strength toward his prey.
His scaly skin glistened and sparkled
in the silvery light of the moon, and
the slight noise made by his rattles
resembled the rustling of parchment,
and alone broke the silence of the
night. This mortal combat in the
stillness of night, between a serpent
and a savage more subtle than the
serpent, had an indescribable fascination;
it was more like a contest
between two evil spirits, in the
shadow of night, over some unfortunate
victim. The serpent now approached
so near the Indian that
he could almost have seized him
with his hand; he raised himself
a last time, and, throwing back
his head, sprang forward. The
savage, guarding himself carefully
with his one hand, had followed
with his eyes the least movement of
the writhing body. It was plain to
see that the final fight had begun,
and could only terminate in the total
vanquishment of one or the other of
the combatants. At the instant that
the snake sprang like an arrow upon
his enemy, the Indian raised his
hand; but this time the attack of the
reptile had been so rapid and instantaneous
that, before he could strike
him a blow, his fangs had entered
his cheek. A hoarse cry died away
in the throat of the savage, who,
seizing the serpent with his hand before
he could escape, raised him to
his mouth, and in his rage tore him
to pieces with his teeth. A vain reprisal&mdash;the
blow had been struck.
A short time after, the most horrible
cries and fearful convulsions
announced that the mortal venom
had entered his veins. The victim
writhed with despair in the midst
of his excruciating agony. It was
thought at first that he had finally
succeeded in getting out; but subsequently
they found the body, enormously
swollen, still held in the
aperture of the air-hole. His bloodshot
eyes were starting from their
sockets, his face as black as ink,
while his gaping mouth revealed
two rows of white teeth, to which
still clung the fragments of the reptile’s
skin, and flakes of bloody foam.
Providence had indeed terribly
avenged the assassination of the
young officer.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c701" id="c701">THE JESUITS IN PARIS.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">A walk</span> in the direction of the
gloomy though now as ever fashionable
Faubourg St. Germain is
not exactly one that a non-fashionable
person would ordinarily choose;
nor does the Rue de Sèvres in that
quarter hold out any particular inducement
for a foot-passenger to
traverse it.</p>

<p>However, it was to the Rue de
Sèvres that, on the 18th of January,
1873, I bent my steps; for at one
o’clock precisely I had an appointment
to keep there with a Father of
the <i>Compagnie de Jésus</i>; and No.
35 in that street is the society’s
headquarters.</p>

<p>I crossed the Seine at the Pont
Royale, and soon found myself in the
main artery of the faubourg&mdash;the
well-known Rue du Bac. I splashed
along with omnibuses that seemed determined
to do their best to destroy
the roughly macadamized carriage-road;
by huge gaps in the façade,
where the <i>pétroleuse</i> had been at work,
and where the dull-red walls looked
as if the destroying element were still
lurking about them; by blue-coated
and blue-hooded policemen, who
scrutinized one to an extent that
made you debate within your mind
whether you had or had not picked
the pocket of a passer-by, or lately
become affiliated to the <i>Internationale</i>.
On, by the “Maison Petit St. Thomas”&mdash;a
large dry-goods establishment,
the name of which may bring
back perhaps to some of our lady readers
the pleasant season passed a few
years since in Paris, with its gay
<i>fêtes</i> and agreeable shopping excursions.
On, till the plate-glass of the
store windows becomes less costly,
and the fish and the <i>charcuterie</i>, or
ham and sausage shops, become
more plentiful. On, till at last, to
right and left, “Rue de Sèvres,” in
bold white letters on a blue ground,
tells me that I have reached my
destination. To save time, I thought
it necessary to ask some one where
the particular house that I wanted
was situated. I looked at a <i>sergent
de ville</i>, but his glances repelled
me. I turned towards a cabman,
but I fancied he expected
something more than I was prepared
to give him; and then, not in
despair, but in the natural order of
things, I had recourse to the inevitable
Parisian chestnut-man, who (I
having taken the precaution of buying
two sous’ worth of damply-warm
chestnuts) willingly gave me all the
information that I required.</p>

<p>The exterior of No. 35 Rue de
Sèvres is as much like that of any
other house in Paris as you can
well imagine. There is a certain number
of feet of stucco, relieved by oblong
windows; and there are two large
<i>portes cochères</i>, or folding-doors, far
apart from one another, and looking
incapable either of being opened or
closed; although, in point of fact,
the one leads to the church, and the
other to the convent.</p>

<p>I entered, of course, by the last-named
portal, and, passing through
the usual French courtyard, knocked
at a glass door, from whence it
was evident that a brother porter
within held communication with the
world without.</p>

<p>I presented my letter of introduction
to him, and, while he was making
arrangements for the transmission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>
of it to the rightful owner, because
it was raining heavily, and
because I saw only one door open,
I entered by that door, and found
myself uninvited and unwittingly in
the <i>conciergerie</i>, or porter’s lodge, itself.</p>

<p>The <i>concierge</i> and his occupation
afforded me a good deal of amusement,
or, to speak less lightly, a good
deal of room for thought during
part of the three-quarters of an hour
that I was destined to wait for the
arrival of the priest with whom I
had the engagement. He has under
his control the management of
ten brown wooden handles, attached
to ten wires, which wires are connected
with ten different doors in
different parts of the establishment.</p>

<p>If a person want a confessor, he
pulls the wire connected with the
church. If a lady desires advice,
another pull opens the parlors to her.
If a priest wishes to come from
the convent, another pull in another
direction is necessary. And as
these pulls (except in the last case)
are invariably followed by a message
sent through a speaking-tube by the
same brother porter, to inform the
priest of the fact that he is wanted;
and as through the before-mentioned
glass door and otherwise
he receives all letters, and answers
all queries, both from within and
without, he has, I take it, a pretty
hard time of it.</p>

<p>I had been too much absorbed
at first to observe what was taking
place around me; but, after a little, I
began to remark that the priests, in
passing to and fro through the
<i>conciergerie</i>, bestowed upon me more
glances of earnest inquiry than I
thought my personal appearance
actually warranted. At last the mystery
was solved by one father being
so good as to tell me that seculars
generally waited in the parlors. I
bowed, thanked him gratefully, and
went; but not before I had discovered
that, if the pigeon-holes for
letters be a true test, there were
fourteen or more priests resident in
the Rue de Sèvres at that particular
time.</p>

<p>I was not sorry for the exchange
of place. It was strangely interesting
to be sitting in those rooms
where, so short a time since, the
Communists, under the command of
an energetic young gentleman named
Citoyen Lagrange, took prisoner
the good Superior Father Olivaint
and his Père Procureur, M. Caubert.</p>

<p>Strange to sit in those parlors, and
gaze upon the large and well-photographed
portraits of those two men
and martyrs, and to notice the remarkable
likeness existing between
them. How both had the same
square forehead and firmly set,
powerful mouth; and how both
looked&mdash;as they were&mdash;soldiers ready
to die under the banner for which
they fought.</p>

<p><i>Ne pleurez pas sur moi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> cried
Father Olivaint to the solitary group
of sympathizers whom he met on his
way to the <i>Préfecture de Police</i>.</p>

<p>No! <i>mon père</i>, we weep not, but
rather thank God that the grand old
spirit of martyrdom has not yet died
out among us!</p>

<p>Besides the thoughts which the
past suggested to me, it was interesting
to note the living occupants
of the rooms. One silver-haired old
gentleman, whom I afterwards found
out to be the self-same Père Alexis
Lefebvre whom Lagrange left in
charge of the house, telling him to
keep it <i>au nom de la Commune</i>, was
holding a very serious conversation
with two or three gentlemen, the red
ribbons in whose button-holes declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>
them to be <i>chevaliers de la
Legion d’Honneur</i>. Another father
was having quite a small reception
of middle-aged married ladies, who
probably had, or desired to have,
sons either at the College of Vaugirard
or at that of S. Geneviève.
Another&mdash;but stay! here is my particular
father, to whose kindness I
owe it that I have been enabled to
write this paper.</p>

<p>The Society of Jesus is so well
known to the citizens of New York
that it would be superfluous for me
to give any lengthened description
of the general principles of government
upon which the order is based.
Suffice it to say, for the benefit of
the uninitiated, that, in common with
other religious, they have a head
resident at the Roman court; provincials
under him, among whom the
supervision of the different stations
is divided; and superiors of individual
houses.</p>

<p>It is peculiar, however, to the Society
of Jesus that each provincial
has attendant upon him an officer
called <i>socius</i>, whose care it is to
look after the pecuniary business of
the province, and in many kindred
ways to assist his chief; but this
office, I am informed, does not confer
any additional rank upon the
holder.</p>

<p>The case is different, however, with
some other officials of the society,
called “consulters,” who, as their
name implies, are chosen from
among the number of the elder and
more experienced brethren.</p>

<p>The house in the Rue de Sèvres
was reopened in the year 1853, after
having been considerably enlarged.</p>

<p>The main building consists of a
plainly-built quadrangle, on the north
side of which, and in immediate connection
with it, stands the church,
dedicated to the sacred name of
Jesus. Running along all the inner
sides of the quadrangle, both on
the ground and the other two floors,
is a lofty, well-ventilated corridor or
cloister, adorned here and there, after
the usual manner of convents, with
religious paintings.</p>

<p>The piece of ground forming the
natural centre of the quadrangle
is laid out with shrubbery, though
without pretension to anything more
than neatness.</p>

<p>On the ground floor are situated
the refectory, the kitchens, and other
offices; while the first and second
floors are devoted exclusively to the
use of the fathers. The cells, like
the corridors, are lofty and well
ventilated, but so simple in their
arrangement as to require no description.</p>

<p>The priests, in the true monastic
spirit, sweep and keep clean their
own rooms and even the cloisters;
and, from the general air of cleanliness
and order that pervades the
place, it is evident that the work is
well done. This walk through the
cloisters of the Jesuit house in Paris
would be uninteresting were it not
for the remembrance of one ne’er-to-be-forgotten
room; and for the sake
of the names printed upon the cell
doors, bringing back as they do to
one’s mind the recollection of past
times and weary troubles; and the
near presence of men so many of
whom have distinguished themselves
in working for the cause of holy
church.</p>

<p>Tread softly, and be silent now,
as ye approach yonder door that
bears no printed name; for the key
that turns the jealous lock will disclose
that to thy gaze which should
excite thy intensest feelings of humility!</p>

<p>It is the “Martyrs’ Room,” where
are kept the relics of the five heroic
men, each one of whom “pro lege
Dei sui certavit usque ad mortem et<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
a verbis impiorum non timuit; fundatus
enim erat supra firmam petram.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Anatole de Beugy was arrested
with the Père Ducoudray.</p>

<p>“Voilà un nom à vous faire couper
le cou,” cried the officer in
charge of the party of arrest.</p>

<p>“Oh! j’espère,” replied the father
calmly; “que vous ne me ferez pas
couper le cou à cause de mon nom.”</p>

<p>I imagine that the officer did not
think more highly of F. de Beugy
after this. In fact, all through the
time of his imprisonment, his captors
seem not to have liked him or
his indomitable <i>sang froid</i>. His coat
is there, in this “Martyrs’ Room” (a
secular one, by the bye), and it is
pierced with seventy-two Communist
bullets&mdash;truly, a very palpable proof
of his enemies’ animosity.</p>

<p>When the Père Olivaint was on his
way to execution, as he descended
the stairs of the prison of La Roquette,
he found&mdash;how naturally!&mdash;that
he had his breviary tightly
grasped in his hand. “They have
me,” perhaps he thought, “but they
need not have <i>this</i>”; and he presented
the book to the <i>concierge</i> of the
prison, who had shown him some
kindness. God knows what motives
the man had, but an officer of the
National Guard snatched it from his
hand, and threw it into the flames of
a fire near by.</p>

<p>The <i>concierge</i> recovered the breviary,
or what remained of it, and it is
now in the “Martyrs’ Room.”</p>

<p>He who can look upon this relic
without emotion must have a very
hard heart indeed!</p>

<p>Do any of us ever think that the
spirit of penance&mdash;corporal penance&mdash;is
dying out amongst us? There
are instruments of self-mortification
in this “Martyrs’ Room” that will
convince us to the contrary.</p>

<p>It is not a miracle&mdash;unless the
world and life be all a miracle&mdash;if,
when men die wondrous deaths, wonderful
things should follow upon those
deaths; and when we see a marble
tablet in this “Martyrs’ Room” telling
how, not eighteen months ago, at
Mass-time, when the priest invoked
the saints whose relics lay beneath
the altars in the church, a child was
healed of a grievous disease, we must
not be surprised.</p>

<p>“Ecce ego vobiscum sum omnibus
diebus usque ad consummationem
sœculi.”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>The beds from La Roquette are
here&mdash;pieces of sacking, stretched
out by a contrivance something similar
to that made use of in the formation
of camp-stools.</p>

<p>Here are the little silver cases in
which the fathers concealed the Blessed
Sacrament, to be at last, as each
anticipated, his viaticum.</p>

<p>But enough....</p>

<p>The church, as I before stated, is
situated on the north side of the quadrangle.
It is Gothic, and of fair proportions,
consisting of a choir and
two aisles. The only side chapel
worthy of note is that where repose
the bodies of the PP. Olivaint, Ducoudray,
Clerc, Caubert, and De
Beugy, murdered on the 24th and
26th of May, 1871, by the Communists
of Paris. The walls, the floor,
the whole chapel, in fact, is literally
covered with wreaths of blood-red
<i>immortelles</i>; while in front of what,
in the event of their canonization,
will be the “Martyrs’ Altar,” are five
white marble slabs, bearing upon them
the names of the five victims, together
with the incidents and date of their
deaths.</p>

<p>My kind guide&mdash;the priest whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
have elsewhere described as being
“my particular father”&mdash;having now
shown me all that was necessary of
the house and chapel, returned with
me to his cell, and, in some very interesting
conversations then and on
my succeeding visits, soon gave me
an idea of the important works undertaken
by his society in Paris.</p>

<p>“We are,” said he, “quite a military
order. Fighting is as much our
business as it is the soldier’s; and I
will even go so far as to say that he
is no true Jesuit who does not fight.
Of enemies, as you may imagine,
there is no lack whatever; but, undoubtedly,
here our <i>bête noire</i> is socialism;
for you know in Paris, as indeed
elsewhere, it has ever been our aim
to undertake, if possible, the education
of the male portion of society.
And this, unfortunately, happens to
be the favorite work of the socialists
also; for, however faulty their code
of moral philosophy may be in other
respects, they have at least grasped
the fact that to educate the affluent
youth of a country is to form the intellect
of a rising generation. However,”
concluded my instructor laughingly,
“we have never been <i>very</i>
popular in European society.”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered abstractedly;
for I was thinking just then of the
sacred name which the order bears&mdash;of
him who was “Virum dolorum
et scientem infirmitatem”;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and my
thoughts reverted to the martyr shrine
that I had so lately seen in the chapel.
“But perhaps you, who have in
such a special manner enrolled yourselves
under the banner of the sacred
name of Jesus, have received of him
a greater share than others of the
shame of the cross.”</p>

<p>The father’s reply was a very practical
one. “My dear sir,” said he,
“nothing of the kind. The world
dislikes us because we persist in teaching,
and because it knows perfectly
well that all our teaching is impregnated
to the core with that particular
kind of Catholicity which it hates&mdash;the
Catholicity, I mean, whose first
principle is devotion and implicit
obedience to the Holy See.”</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, from the
foregoing fragment of conversation,
that the Jesuits’ work in Paris is for
the most part the Catholic education
of the upper classes.</p>

<p>The fathers in the Rue de Sèvres
do, in one way and another, a good
deal of work, although but little,
perhaps, of a character that directly
identifies itself with the peculiar animus
of the order to which I have
alluded. They are popular as confessors,
and this involves a good deal
of labor.</p>

<p>They direct two confraternities of
men, each numbering respectively
upwards of two hundred members.
One is for the fathers of families, and
the other for young men. Each society
meets in the chapel upon alternate
Thursdays for Mass and instruction.
Again, the Jesuits render every
assistance that lies in their power to
the parochial clergy; and thus the
fathers become, now conductors of
missions, and now Lenten or Advent
preachers.</p>

<p>At the Rue de Sèvres are given
retreats, not only to their own brethren
and the secular clergy, but
also, and on a large scale, to private
individuals&mdash;men whom care has
driven to seek refuge in the contemplation
of the treasures laid up for
them in heaven.</p>

<p>Jesuits, whose duty calls them to
places <i>en route</i> to which Paris becomes
a natural resting-place, find a
haven in the Rue de Sèvres. The
provincial resides here when he is
in Paris; and, finally, a few men who,
at a moment’s notice, are available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span>
to be sent anywhere to meet a sudden
emergency, make for the time
this most interesting house their
home.</p>

<p>In a dark, narrow street in close
proximity to the Pantheon&mdash;in a
street that, in its unlikeness to some
other parts of the city, reminds one
of the Paris of history&mdash;is situated the
College of S. Geneviève. This is
the chief educational establishment
of the order; the other being that of
the school of the Immaculate Conception
at Vaugirard&mdash;a village on
the southwest side of Paris.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter in the
life of what, next to holy church
itself, must ever be considered the
most wonderful organization that the
world has ever seen, I cannot do
better than append a brief account of
the character of the work done in
these two houses.</p>

<p>The Ecole S. Geneviève, founded
in the year 1854, proposes for its
object the preparation of youths for
admission into the various professional
colleges in France. That the
work is a success may be seen in
the fact that, in 1872-1873, sixty-four
students were actually admitted from
thence to the military academy at
St. Cyr, while twenty-three more
were declared “admissibles”; that
the same school sent sixteen boys to
the Ecole Centrale, to be educated
as engineers, seven to the Ecole Navale,
and twenty-three to the Polytechnique;
and, lastly, that, exclusive
of these, many more have been admitted
into other similar establishments
in Paris or elsewhere. The
aggregate number of students appears,
from the statistics put into my
hands, to exceed four hundred and
fifty.</p>

<p>The present rector of S. Geneviève
is the immediate successor of
the Père Ducoudray; and it is a
noteworthy fact that three out of the
five men killed under the Commune
were connected with the school;
the other two being PP. Caubert
and Clerc. The services of the last-named
father must have been extremely
valuable; for, previous to his
admission to the Society of Jesus,
he had been for many years a naval
officer.</p>

<p>The school of the Immaculate
Conception, at Vaugirard, is perhaps
as perfect a specimen of its kind as
can be found in Europe.</p>

<p>At the present moment, there are
upwards of six hundred and forty
boys, representing the flower of the
French <i>beau monde</i>, receiving at this
institution a sound high-class education.</p>

<p>On his entrance, the scholar is at
first put through an elementary
course, out of which he is drafted
into the sixth form, from which he
rises to the third, and then completes
his education by successive courses
of classics, rhetoric, and philosophy.</p>

<p>Thus, to an outsider and to a
passer-by in Paris, appears the work
of that grand order whose aim we
believe to be no less than the motto
they have adopted:</p>

<p><i>Ad majorem Dei gloriam!</i></p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c707" id="c707">SAN MARCO: A REMINISCENCE.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> all the great cities of the Old
World, the cathedral is the nucleus
round which gathers the social life
of the community. It is a national
monument, a historical representative;
it keeps in its tombs records
more precious to the nation than
those treasured in archives and libraries;
it is identified with the city’s
success or failure, and often bears
visible marks of this sympathetic
life in its trophies or in its ruins.
Of old, the principal church of a
city became the mirror of the people’s
individuality; it took on the
form that best expressed the people’s
genius; it was an index to the national
character. If this is so with
other churches, it is perhaps even
more strikingly true of S. Mark’s in
Venice.</p>

<p>This unique church, the S. Sophia
of the West, and the inheritrix <i>par
excellence</i> of Byzantine treasures, is
one that, to our fancy, makes a deeper
impression on the stranger than
S. Peter’s at Rome. To describe it
technically; to speak of its uneven
floor and crowded, heavy pilasters;
to enumerate its columns, and analyze
the color of its mosaics, is
simply a desecration, besides inevitably
implying an untruth. Criticism
cannot be anything but an afterthought,
even though genuine admiration
should not be the first impression
of the visitor. A spell is
laid upon you at the very outset, and
an indescribable feeling of reverence
steals over your every sense as you
tread the dusky aisles. We have always
found it most satisfactory, in
visiting either churches or cities, to
slowly drink in the spirit of the
place, rather than rush into a dissection
of its detailed sights; and we are
persuaded that this slow, receptive
method is the only way in which to
enjoy travel of any sort.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, S. Mark’s became
so woven in with our daily life
that, without being able to give a
single date or statistical fact concerning
it, we were yet entirely penetrated
with its peculiar beauty, but,
above all, by its silent influence.</p>

<p>We went there every morning to
early Mass&mdash;which, by the bye, is the
only way to see a beautiful church
on the Continent. You grow to
love it, to know its every corner, to
feel its peace, to be quite at home
in it, to look out for the sunbeam
throwing its line of gold over some
particular spot on the marble floor,
or for the red glow of the sunset
to illumine some favorite mosaic.
Then, too, you begin to know your
fellow-worshippers, and to expect
the clamorous hum of devotion with
which this old man tells his beads,
or to be disappointed if you fail
to see the old beggar-woman crouching
behind the ponderous door, and
stretching out her hand with a ready
blessing for the daily alms. S. Mark’s
is one of the most peaceful churches
in Europe; silence seems natural to
it, and not even a great ceremony
appears to create any stir there.
The midnight Mass, which, by a singular
exemption from the ordinary
rule, takes place on Christmas eve,
at five o’clock in the afternoon (this
and the Christmas Mass at Vienna
are the only such exceptions), is celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span>
with great pomp, and the
music is not too full of repose; yet
the spirit of the church seems serenely
unaltered, and the great brooding
silence hangs over the echoes of the
pageants, hushing them till the mind
wanders away so far from their earthly
presence that it is hardly more
conscious of them than a man
standing on a high mountain would
be of the suppressed hum of the city
lying at his feet. But another solemnity
have we witnessed in this church
much more congenial to its spirit,
and indeed the most impressive of
all Christian ceremonies&mdash;the office
of <i>Tenebræ</i>. S. Mark’s is never lighted
by anything save the golden
lamps of its distant shrines, and the
tall columns of wax on the high altar.
The service on the three evenings
of Holy Wednesday and Thursday,
and Good Friday, is generally after
dark, and every one brings his own
light&mdash;a <i>cerino</i>, or coil of waxen taper&mdash;by
which to read his book. This
will barely suffice for two persons to
read by, so that, from the gallery
where we were stationed, we could
see the church sown with stars, like
the heavens at midnight; while, in the
various fantastic recesses above and
below our own, called galleries, glimmered
a score of similar fitful lights.
The attendance was small, and the
beauty of the sight thereby increased.
The chant, coming from below as
the invisible choir breathed out the
solemn lamentations, had a weird,
stilling effect, like that of the sighing
of the wind among the pines, suggesting
everything that was strange, far-away,
and desolate. We had heard
the <i>Miserere</i> of the Sistine Chapel in
Rome, and likened it to what one
might dream the angels to have sung
while Christ hung on the cross of
Calvary; but this&mdash;the same service,
the same words, almost the same
chant&mdash;seemed rather what the
watchers round the sepulchre might
have whispered amid their sobs, as
they left the sacred body of their
dead Lord on the evening of the first
Good Friday.</p>

<p>Among the few people whose faces
were near enough to be recognized
were some of our acquaintances of
the Venetian <i>salons</i>. They wore the
customary dress, black gowns and
lace veils falling gracefully around
them. One was a great beauty
by night, though what looked a
soft, cream-colored complexion then
would look sallow by day. She was
the daughter of a Jew, married to a
nominal Catholic, but an actual atheist,
and herself practised no religion
whatsoever. Here she was, with her
beautiful, hopeless eyes fixed on the
religious ceremonial with a sort of
weary, hungry, perplexed look, while
a friend tried earnestly to interest
her in the spirit of the ritual.</p>

<p>Don Carlos and his family were
there too, he and his brother being
mere boys at the time, and more
occupied by the care required to
keep the <i>cerino</i> from burning down
too low than by the solemn ceremonies
at which they were assisting.
The daily life, if one may so call
it, of the Venetian Basilica has, however,
more power to charm the
memory than its hours of splendid
show. We like best to think of it
almost empty and quite silent, its
high altar seldom used, and its Lady
Chapel, Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament,
and altar of the Crucifix
quaintly propped up against the
corner of the pilaster, surrounded by
the few worshippers whose faithful
instincts bid them haunt the same
spots day after day. In the early
morning, you enter the seemingly
deserted church. No hum of prayer
is heard; hardly a human form is in
sight. Suddenly, to the right of the
high chancel, the sound of a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
bell is heard, and, from the winding
path that leads through chapels and
pillars from the sacristy, a priest appears,
vested for Mass, and accompanied
by his server. From hidden
corners rise up silent forms that join
his train, and follow him to the altar
which he has chosen; a devout congregation
is quietly collected, and
crowds round the rails, outside and
inside, or, where there are no rails,
presses up to the priest’s very feet,
and often impedes the server’s movements.
The latter is not always
very reverential, however, and his
motions sometimes savor of abruptness;
but the people are too simple-minded
to be shocked. When the
bell should be rung, the boy ensconces
himself at the side of the altar,
and pulls a string attached to a bell
high up above his head; and here, as
in most Italian churches, the <i>Domine
non sum dignus</i> is not distinguished
by a bell at all. Another feature of
S. Mark’s is the collector. At every
Mass, he comes round, rattling a
box in the face of each person, and
crying, in a monotonous tone, “For
the poor, my brethren,” or, “For the
souls in purgatory”; and, as there are
many collectors, and the succession
of Masses at each of the three or
four altars is uninterrupted, it may
be judged whether this simple and
erratic style of collecting is not rather
an infliction than otherwise; yet
somehow it fits in with the spirit
of the place. S. Mark’s contains no
pictures; that is, no masterpieces of
those whom the world recognizes as
the kings of their art. SS. Giovanni
e Paolo, the Jesuit church, that of
the Frari, and many others, are rich
in these treasures; but San Marco has
its matchless mosaics, combining
Scriptural, historical, and allegorical
subjects of colossal dimensions, with
the most fanciful arabesques and
purely decorative tracery. The
colors, both in the interior, where the
low arches seem lined with the
golden glow of an everlasting sunset,
and on the outer porch, where
figures of vast size and groups of
bold conception strike the eye, are
almost as brilliant to-day as they
must have been a thousand years
ago.</p>

<p>If there is no <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of modern
art, there is nevertheless something
more suggestive to the Catholic
mind. The “picture” we grew
to love most in all Venice was no
Titian or Paul Veronese, nor even a
Bellini (though the latter have the
fragrance of Beato Angelico about
them); but a brown Byzantine Madonna,
hidden behind crowns and
necklets of heavy gold, and enthroned
in a deep, receding shrine&mdash;a
temple of blazing gems under the
massive, overhanging arches of S.
Mark’s. The face, as revealed in
the unadorned prints of it sold all
over Venice, is very beautiful, the
features severely regular, and the expression
one of infinite majesty and
calm. We know more than one of
these sombre masterpieces of unknown
artists, which no one admires,
because no one, as a rule, <i>sees</i> them,
but which, though overloaded with
precious metals to the detriment of
their beauty, and branded contemptuously
by sightseers as mere “miraculous
images,” are yet very pure
models of ancient art, and most interesting
relics of early Christianity.
For instance, there is one at Warsaw
in universal veneration all over Poland,
and whose grave, dignified,
and grandly serene cast of features
raises it as a work of religious art
far above the portraits of simpering
maidens, buxom peasants, or gorgeous
sultanas, whom the world
has recognized for nearly four hundred
years as the type of the Mother
of God. Russia is rich in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
Byzantine pictures, and the Greek
Church holds them in as great honor
as the Catholic.</p>

<p>We seem to have wandered out of
Venice, somehow, in this gossip about
unrecognized pictures; but the mention
of Byzantium in reality brings
us back to the lagoons, for it is as familiar
to the Venetian as his own republic.
Indeed, one would think
that Venice had no civilization before
she invaded Constantinople in
1204; for everything of any value,
artistic or historical, is always traced
up to this date. As it is impossible
to create a new Venice, so it would
be to build a new Basilica of San
Marco; the city of the Evangelist
stands alone in history, and its cathedral
alone in art. It has the rare
merit of suggesting nothing if not
Christianity; it is more individual
than S. Peter’s, and less associated
with pageants and festivals; it is no
mere imitation or adaptation of the
forms of pagan art; it suits the purple
sky and brilliant atmosphere of
the South, yet without jarring on the
sense of the Christianity to whose
use it is dedicated; and, if its style is
less symbolical than the Gothic, it is
at least less servile than the Palladian.
The chief impression it has left
on us, as well as the only analysis
we wish to make of its beauties, is
this&mdash;that it is the easiest church in
Europe in which to pray without
distraction.</p>

good deeds in water. The one
grand, true, and pure wife of Henry

of Christ, on the one hand, and the
world and the gates of hell, on the
other, appeared to be reached in
the French Revolution. Heaven-born
piety and hell-born iniquity, each in
its most potential form, seemed to
meet in a death-grapple. Astonished
and awe-stricken nations looked on
as spectators of the combat, as if
upon that field hung the fate of
Christianity, of revelation, of, in short,
the subordination of the creature to
the Creator. The struggle indeed
was appalling; and the modern followers
of that fool who said in his
heart, There is no God, often threw
up their fool’s-caps, <i>bonnets-d’âne</i>, or
<i>bonnets-rouges</i> in token of victory.
But the end was not yet, as it is not
yet. In that struggle, as in all others
for eighteen hundred years, the divine
prophecy was vindicated, and the
oracles of Satan for a time were
silenced, at least until the father of
sin could rehabilitate them in other
forms. The American Catholic
whose memory serves him for a
couple of score of years, may remember
to have seen at Mount S. Mary’s
College, or in Baltimore, a French
priest, whose very physiognomy
would strongly rivet attention. We
remember once, in early college days,
passing from Georgetown College,
where we were acquiring the humanities,
to Mount S. Mary’s on a holiday
excursion. We had fresh in mind
as the very ideal of a venerable priest
good old Father Jerome Dzierozynski,
priest, philosopher, scholar, saint, the
pastor of the college, and a model
for his younger brethren aspiring to
Christian perfection. We found his
counterpart in the French priest,
Father Bruté, at the mountain. His
very presence was inspiring. The
man of God was plainly discernible
in his calm, placid face, which spoke,
without words, of holiness, of wisdom,
of learning, of the subjection
of self and the man of the flesh, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
age, to the spiritual man, the pilgrim
to eternity. Our personal recollections
of this eminent man, however,
go not beyond appearances and first-sight
impressions. We are indebted
to Archbishop Bayley’s fascinating
work for a knowledge of his eventful
career. Born and bred in France in
a model Catholic family, he witnessed
in his boyhood the practical
workings of the French Revolution.
He had not the honor to undergo
exile or martyrdom, but he knew intimately
many of the victims of that
reign of <i>Satanas</i>; and his young
eyes were made to ache with the
lurid coruscations of the philosophy
of Antichrist, which swept over
France as fire sweeps over a prairie.</p>

<p>Losing his father early in life, his
education was conducted by a wise
and prudent mother, such as is called
in Holy Writ “a valiant woman.”
He was sent to the best schools of
the day in his native city of Rennes,
and he was fortunate in having for
his teachers priests eminent for piety
and learning, several of whom gave
up their lives for the faith. For a
short time he worked as a practical
printer. “In 1793-4,” he writes of
himself, “during the height of ‘The
Terror,’ my mother made me work
in the printing-office to save me from
being enrolled in a regiment of children
named ‘The Hope of the Country’;
and a hopeful set they were.”
A regiment of boys was formed, who
acted as so many young demons.
“My mother was much pressed to
allow me to join them, and was terribly
alarmed on this account. I remained
in the printing-office nearly
a year, and became a pretty good
compositor.” To the honor of the craft,
we may add that his widowed mother
had a printing establishment under
her own direction, probably derived
from her first husband, Francis Vatar,
printer to the king and parliament at
Rennes, who prided himself on his
hereditary art, his ancestors having
been printers for many generations.</p>

<p>After this interruption to his studies,
he resumed them, and in due
time began the study of medicine.
His fondness for the profession, his
talents, his industry, gave sure indications
of eminent success. In 1799,
at twenty years of age, he entered the
Medical School at Paris. “At the
time this occurred,” he says, “I was
entirely wrapt up in my medical studies,
and preparing for the prize.”
This indeed he obtained. He graduated
with the highest honors.
There were at that time eleven hundred
students attending the course;
out of these, one hundred and twenty
were chosen by <i>concursus</i> as the best;
and among this number M. Bruté
received the first prize after another
examination. An official appointment
immediately followed this
youthful triumph. But his thoughts
were now turned to another field of
labor, and to that vocation alone more
worthy than medicine of his high
endowments. He determined to study
for the church. “He was not
led to abandon a profession to which
he had devoted so many years of
assiduous study, and which opened
its most brilliant prospects before
him,” as Dr. McCaffrey remarks,
“from any feelings of disgust. He
always honored it as one of the
noblest to which a highly gifted and
philanthropic man can devote himself.
Delightful as his conversation
was to all, and to men of science in
particular, it was peculiarly so to the
student or to the practitioner or
professor of medicine. He turned
from it only because he had higher
and more important objects in view.
His eleven hundred classmates in
medicine told him that it was easy
to find physicians for the body, but
the Revolution had made it more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>
difficult to find physicians for the souls
of men. The guillotine and prisons
and privations of exile had spared
but a comparatively small number of
the former clergy, and of these many
were occupied in foreign missions.
Dreadful as had been the ravages
of infidelity and impiety, and the
almost entire privation of all spiritual
succor, an immense number of the
French people still remained faithful
to their religion, and a new supply
of Levites, to fill the places of those
who had perished, was called for on
every side.”</p>

<p>The medical student who had
gone through the Parisian curriculum
with a pure heart and a sinless
soul proved thereby his title to join
the choicest body of Levites. He
not only had gone through the
course with virginal purity, but he
had already made a fight for the faith
amidst its most potent enemies. If
he resembled Aloysius at Rennes, he
showed the spirit of Bayard at Paris.
“Not satisfied with professing and
openly practising his religion, he
entered into a combination with
several of his fellow-students, particularly
those from his own province,
boldly to oppose the false principles
to which they were obliged to listen.
They chose such subjects for their
theses before the class as to enable
them to avow their belief in revelation,
and to defend its truth. One
of the beneficial effects which followed
from this course, was that the
attention of the government was
called to it. Bonaparte, then First
Consul, was laboring to restore Christianity
in France, as the necessary
means of reorganizing society; and
the infidel professors were made to
confine their teaching to its proper
limits.”</p>

<p>It would be well if infidel or atheistical
professors at the present day
could be restrained to their respective
courses of instruction. Some
of them seem to think it incumbent
on them to proclaim, <i>ex cathedrâ</i>,
their irreligious or atheistical convictions.
Such men are entirely unfit
for their occupations, no matter
what talents or learning they may
possess, and they ought to be silenced
by authority. This may be considered
illiberal by some, but let
them make a little change in the order,
and suppose a Catholic professor
of anatomy to give a daily discourse
to his pupils on the infallibility of
the Pope before mixed classes of
Catholics and Protestants, Jews and
infidels: would such teachings, we
ask, be greeted with liberal approbation?
We think not. Then the
infidel professor cannot expect a
Christian public to consent to his
teachings, beyond his proper course.
This is a practical question of the
day, and all honest men should demand
in the teaching of medicine,
or of any science or sciences, that
the teachers should confine themselves
to demonstrative and demonstrable
facts. It is the last degree
of folly or of impudence to attempt
to prove anything of the relations of
the soul to the body by the aid of
scalpel or microscope. Professors
in the Parisian schools still claim the
right to teach covert or overt atheism,
and they deem interference
nothing less than persecution. They
are philosophers, and claim free
thought. But their opponents say
properly (and this matter has been
before the French Senate) that it is
not the thought of the professors
which is the matter in dispute, but
their officious <i>teachings</i>. If they are
free to think what they please, says
an eminent medical writer, M. Garnier,
they are not therefore free to
profess or to teach all that they
think. Animism, spiritism, materialism,
are equally intractable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
science. In these matters science
can prove nothing; the rights of
science, then, are neither compromised
nor sacrificed by keeping it
within the limits defined by its very
nature.</p>

<p>All parents and guardians of
youth, whatever their faith, or want
of it, should protest against professors
of medicine making use of their
chairs to inculcate upon their pupils
that the soul is subordinate to the
body, the immortal to the mortal
part of man. These are matters
which are not now, never were, and
never will be under the dominion of
human wisdom or learning.</p>

<p>We will now follow Dr. Bruté
rapidly in his career as physician in
the higher order, that is, for the souls
of men. He made his studies in divinity
with the intense earnestness
of his nature. “Theology was a
science for which his mind was admirably
fitted. He loved his religion,
and it evidently became his delight
thoroughly to explore the very foundations
of it.” He was ordained priest
in 1808, and was for a short time
professor of theology in his native
city. In 1810, he came to the United
States, and began that active career
in Baltimore and at Mount S. Mary’s
College which made him so favorably
known to the clergy and people of
this country. “If Mount S. Mary’s, in
addition to all the other benefits it
has bestowed upon Catholicity in
this country, has been in a remarkable
degree the nursery of an intelligent,
active, zealous priesthood, exactly
such as was needed to supply
the wants of the church in this
country, every one at all acquainted
with the history of that institution
will allow that the true ecclesiastical
spirit was stamped upon it by Bishop
Bruté. His humility, piety, and
learning made him a model of the
Christian priest; and the impression
of his virtues made upon both
ecclesiastical and lay students surpassed
all oral instruction. The
Catholic religion alone can produce
such men, and hence their example
confirms the faith and elevates the
character of all who come in contact
with them. The name of Bishop
Bruté has been, and ever will be,
associated with that of Bishop Dubois
as common benefactors to the
infant church in this country.”</p>

<p>The church in America has obligations
to a considerable body of
French priests, driven from their own
country for the most part by the
ruthless madmen who for a season
ruled fair France, which obligations
can never be repaid and have
scarcely been recognized. Even
American Catholics often speak of
Lafayette and his followers as the
only Frenchmen entitled to our
gratitude, forgetting entirely the valiant
soldiers of the cross from the
same country who Christianized our
savages in the wilderness, or who
astonished our Protestant civilization
with their learning, their talents, and
their virtues. Speaking of Bishop
Cheverus, first Catholic Bishop of
Boston, “which of us,” says Dr. W. E.
Channing, the most eminent Protestant
minister of his time in that city&mdash;“which
of us would like to have our
lives compared with his?” This candid
and generous admission might
have applied to others as well as to the
almost peerless Cheverus, but none
could have deserved it more. How
truly is the blood of the martyrs the
seed of the church!&mdash;including in the
martyrs all who suffer in person or
property for Christ. The French
Revolution sent to our shores as fine
a body of priests as the world ever
saw&mdash;learned, pious, accomplished,
refined, and highly cultured in every
sense, they left an ineffaceable impression
upon their successors in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>
priesthood in this country. In the
order of God’s providence, persecution,
in fact, has given the greatest
impetus to Catholicity in America.
The perpetual persecution of the
Irish on account of their religion,
the recent or actual persecutions by
Garibaldi, Victor Emanuel, and Bismarck,
all give laborers to this
vineyard, where they are so much
needed, and where they are doing a
world of good a century in advance
of an adequate supply of native
priests.</p>

<p>In 1834, Dr. Bruté was consecrated
as Bishop of Vincennes; in 1839,
worn out with much and faithful service,
his pure spirit took its departure.
In his poor diocese, he had
everything to construct, and everybody
to instruct, even some Indian
tribes, who received him with great
joy as a “chief of the black robes,”
a priest of “the true prayer.” He
had no sinecure dignity. “At home
he was at once the bishop, the pastor
of the congregation, the professor
of theology for his seminary, and a
teacher for one of his academies.”
These give a small idea of his labors.
When the king of terrors (to most
men) came, he found the bishop at
his post, on duty, like the faithful
Roman sentinel at the gates of Pompeii.
But there were no terrors for
him. “On the morning of the day
before his death, he remarked to the
clergyman who attended him with
unwearied solicitude and affection:
‘My dear child, I have the whole
day yet to stay with you; to-morrow
with God!’ To another pious friend
he used these simple but expressive
words: ‘I am going home!’” And
when his pure soul was disengaging
itself, as it were, from the body, having
received all the last rites of the
church, he directed the prayers for
the departing to be said, which he
answered devoutly and fervently to
the last; and then he entered upon
that eternal life which he had always
been contemplating, and for which
his whole career had been one long
preparation.</p>

<p>We would wish, if space permitted,
to give selections from some of the
good bishop’s “Brief Notes” of his
recollections connected with the persecutions
in France in 1793 and the
following years, for they show in their
simple details the striking contrasts
between the lives and deaths of the
children of Christ and the children
of Antichrist, among the French
people of that day. Never before in
the history of the church, or in the
history of humanity, did virtue and
vice, face to face, reach loftier heights
or deeper depths.</p>

<p>The aim of the French rulers was
to extinguish Christianity. The “age
of reason” had arrived, and its advanced
fautors determined that the
world should recognize it. But the
priests stood in the way, and, by some
strange mischance, all the honest
and meritorious people of the land
made common cause with the priests.
To bring these people to a just appreciation
of reason, the churches
were plundered and dismantled, and
turned into temples of reason or barracks
and stables, and, if possible,
viler uses. To take God’s house
from him was to deprive him of a
dwelling-place in France, and the
example of France would be followed
everywhere, so that God should
be banished from the earth of his
own creation. But the priests&mdash;the
unreasonable, intractable priests&mdash;instead
of adopting the new lights,
would adhere to the doctrines and
traditions of past ages. When the
churches were closed, they would
worship God by stealth, with their
followers, in private houses, in the
fields, in the woods, offering their
pure and unbloody sacrifice on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
hill and in every dale and valley of
France. To correct this, their existence,
and that of those who harbored
them, was demanded in bloody
sacrifice. “During the progress of
the persecution,” says Bishop Bruté,
“the greater number of the priests
of the diocese had been either
guillotined or shot, or transported
to the penal colonies. The more
aged and infirm were imprisoned
in the Castle of St. Michael. Of
the few left in deep concealment,
some were almost daily discovered,
and, according to the <i>law</i>, led with
those who had harbored them to the
guillotine within twenty-four hours.”
Young Bruté often followed the accused
to the criminal court, and listened
with palpitating heart to the
mock trials of priests and people.
His instances are deeply touching.
The very <i>capitula</i> arrest attention:
as “Trial of the priest and the three
sisters of La Chapelle S. Aubert,
Diocese of Rennes.” The priest, M.
Raoul, was summarily convicted and
sentenced; he submitted without a
murmur, but attempted to offer a
plea for the sisters, who sheltered
him, when he was immediately silenced.
The ladies were then put
upon trial, and convicted and sentenced
also. One of them had been
a nun, and, driven from her convent
home, had returned to her sister’s
house. She was a woman of spirit,
and when under the sentence of
death she had a word to say to the
court and the spectators. “When
the sentence had been pronounced,
the nun could not restrain her feelings
of indignation. She rose from
her seat, snatched from her cap the
national cockade, which even the
women were obliged to wear during
those days of national delusion, and,
trampling it under her feet, she addressed
alternately the judges and
the people with two or three sentences
of vehement reproach: ‘Barbarous
people,’ she exclaimed,
‘amongst what savage nations has
hospitality ever been made a crime
punishable with death?’ I cannot
now call to mind her other expressions,
except that she appealed to
the higher tribunal of God, and denounced
his judgment against them....
The same day these four
victims were immolated upon the
fatal guillotine. They were taken, I
think, as was often the case, from the
tribunal to the scaffold, which remained
permanently erected under the
windows.” “A priest and peasant,
bound together, were led to the ‘Fusilade’
singing the service for the dead.”
One morning early, young Bruté was
startled from his studies by the notes
of the <i>Libera me, Domine</i>, from the
Burial Service of the church, sung by
some one in the streets. “I understood
too well what it all meant, and
ran to the door to go out and follow
them, agitated and partially frightened
by the usual terror which rested
on my heart, but at the same time
animated by the song of death, for it
was the priest who was thus singing
his own <i>Libera</i>, and the poor peasant
stepped along quickly by his
side, looking, as may be supposed,
very serious, but without the least
appearance of fear. The impression
on my mind is that the soldiers, who
generally followed their prisoners
with jokes and abuse, accompanied
these two in silence.”</p>

<p>Priests and peasants and nobles
were victims to the impious rage of
those days, and even women and
children. It is appalling to read the
summary account of “children shot
and children drowned; women shot
and women drowned; priests shot
and priests drowned; nobles drowned,
and artisans drowned, besides the
hosts who were guillotined or sent
into exile.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot draw further from the
pages of this most interesting book,
but the reader may do so at his leisure.
We have thought sometimes
in reading it that Victor Emanuel
and Bismarck might find its perusal
profitable. While writing this, we see
by the papers that the Upper House
of the Prussian diet has passed a bill
authorizing a complete control of the
church&mdash;that is, of all religious matter&mdash;by
the state government. In other
words, the church must be the king’s
creature, or must perish. We shall
see. There is traditional policy in
this move. In one of Frederic the
Great’s letters to Voltaire, he expresses
a wish to break up the Catholic
Church first, for then, he adds,
the Protestant churches will be very
easily disposed of.</p>

<p>The modern persecutors might
see, if they were not blind, that after
all the follies and crimes and slaughters
of the French Revolution&mdash;and
surely they can bring nothing worse
or more potent than this&mdash;the
church has risen again in France in
her glory, and that hers is at this
day the only one great conservative
influence in France, as everywhere
else in Christendom. Surely it is
plain that, though often doomed to
death, she is fated not to die. But
how strange the infatuation of princes
or people who would wish to blot
out Christianity from the face of the
earth, or to make it a mere servile
tool of tyrants! To blot it out! and
what then the history of man? Some
philosophic inquirer has suggested
the extinction of the sun, and then
on this now bright planet of ours
universal darkness, intense cold, the
congelation of all the waters, the
death of all vegetable life, the death
of all animal life, and of the last
strong man in the midst of an infinitude
of horrors!</p>

<p>Even so in the moral world if the
church of Christ, by the malice of
man, could be extinguished: darkness,
crime, and death, death temporal
and eternal, would be poor lost
man’s only inheritance. But, thanks
be to God, we know that the bark
of Peter will survive all tempests
in the future as in the past, and that
she will float over the stormy sea of
time in safety to the consummation
of ages; for the divine assistance is
promised to her for ever.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we beg leave to
express the hope that Archbishop
Bayley will give to the world a new
and enlarged edition of Bishop
Bruté’s life, as his materials are by
no means exhausted. It will be no
detriment to Mr. Clarke’s excellent
work to give to many of the deceased
prelates, individually, much more extended
biographies than that gentleman
could possibly give in his instructive
pages. And finally, we may
express a hope that, when Lady Herbert
edits a new edition, she will not
forget to give due credit to the distinguished
author whose labors she has
in some sense so fully appreciated.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>

<p class="pind"><span class="smcap"><a name="c718a" id="c718a">Lectures and Sermons.</a></span> By the Very
Rev. Thomas N. Burke, O.P. New
York: P. M. Haverty. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This, the second volume, containing
thirty-two of F. Burke’s magnificent discourses,
has just been issued by his
authorized publisher, Mr. Haverty. In
neither matter nor form is it inferior to
the splendid volume published a year
ago. It contains lectures on most of
the important questions of the day, and
nowhere better than in these lectures
may be found a solution to the great
problems that the moral and social condition
of our age and country present.
The fundamental principles of religion,
order, and law treasured up in the <i>Summa</i>
of S. Thomas, F. Burke has thoroughly
mastered and made his own; and, armed
with these, he comes forth in the might
of his eloquence, prepared to offer a
remedy for every disease, intellectual
and moral, of the XIXth century. The
principles which he advocates and has
proclaimed on the house-tops, from the
Merrimac to the Mississippi, are just
those by which modern society must be
saved, if saved at all. His mission has
been called a providential one with reference
to the Irish in this country; but
we believe it to be a providential one
with reference to the American people
at large. Never before have the genuine
principles of human action been so publicly
and brilliantly taught in our land;
and the good seed, sown broadcast as it
has been, cannot but take root and produce
fruit in due season.</p>

<p>Even now the conversions to our holy
religion, wrought through the instrumentality
of F. Burke’s preaching, are many
and widespread. But how great and
palpable the good he has done amongst
his own people! He has aroused their
love for faith and fatherland to enthusiasm;
he has made them to realize the
important influence they are to exert on
this continent; he has taught them to
feel their dignity; he has told them what
is required of them as citizens of the republic;
he has pointed out their dangers,
and suggested remedies for their disorders.
His constant aim has been to instil
into the minds of his countrymen
every sentiment of religion, patriotism,
and honor that could elevate and ennoble
a generous race. Since the days of
O’Connell, no one man has done so much
for the Irish people, and none has received
so much of their gratitude and
confidence. It is but a short time ago
that we heard a poor fellow say he had
resolved “never to get drunk again, lest
he might disgrace a country that could
produce such a man as F. Tom Burke”&mdash;a
noble sentiment truly, and one that
speaks volumes for the man who could
inspire it. We seem to be describing
the work of a lifetime, and surely what
we have said and had reason to say
would make a long lifetime illustrious.
Yet in very truth are we but enumerating
the labors of a few months. What may
not critics be able to write in the future,
should F. Burke return to us, and resume
his glorious work?</p>

<p class="pind"><span class="smcap"><a id="c718b" name="c718b">The Irish Race in the Past and in
the Present.</a></span> By Rev. Aug. J. Thebaud,
S.J. New York: D. Appleton
&amp; Co. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">F. Thebaud has written us a philosophy
of Irish history. He has sought out
the characteristics of the Celtic race, and
has, we think, discovered them and successfully
traced them down from the
earliest to the latest annals of that grand
old people. He has read Irish history,
and reflected on it, and his views, in relation
to the Ireland of the past at least,
are correct. We are glad that one not
an Irishman has written this book; for
when an Irishman speaks of his country’s
bygone glories, he is pretty generally
accused of exaggeration, and the world
refuses to be interested in the details of
an antique history which it supposes to
be in great part the creation of national
pride. We have always regretted that
Montalembert did not write a history of
Ireland, as he once intended to do, and
we have never quite forgiven Victor Cousin
for the part he took in dissuading the
count from carrying out this the cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span>
scheme of his youth. Had the brilliant
author of <i>The Monks of the West</i>
compiled the annals of Ireland, the story
of Erin’s ancient greatness and civilization
would now have its fitting place in
the classic lore of Europe. F. Thebaud’s
treatment of early Irish history is very
satisfactory; he has a real love and admiration
for that land&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“History’s sad wonder, whom all lands save one<br />
Gaze on through tears, and name with gentler tone.”</p>

<p class="p1">Christian Ireland in its golden age is
particularly dear to him, and he delights
in describing the glories of that Erin,
then</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Lamp of the north when half the world was night,<br />
Now England’s darkness ‘mid her noon of light.”</p>

<p class="p1">In dealing with the events of this period,
we think the learned author more happy
than in his treatment of modern Irish
history, though we are not at all disposed
to disagree to any great extent with his
views of martyred Ireland’s wrongs and
their needs. We, too, believe that</p>

<div class="limit6">
<p class="pp8 p1">... “Ere long</p>
<p class="pp4">Peace Justice-built the Isle shall cheer.”</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">From what he says of the present condition
of things in that misgoverned country,
however, we do think he has not consulted
the most reliable authorities on all
points; his account of the ignorance and
destitution of the poorer classes is certainly
somewhat exaggerated. This is
about the only thing we find to criticise
in a book which is manifestly a labor of
love, and executed with an ardor and enthusiasm
that love alone can enlist. F.
Thebaud’s work is a valuable and highly
important contribution to Irish history.
To our Irish fellow-citizens it commends
itself. To our American and non-Catholic
readers who want to form correct
views of Ireland and its people, we commend
it.</p>

<p class="pind"><span class="smcap"><a name="c719a" id="c719a">The Limerick Veteran</a>; or, The Foster
Sisters.</span> By Agnes M. Stewart.
Baltimore: Kelly, Piet &amp; Co. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a historical romance, and a
very good one of its kind. Throughout
its two hundred and fifty pages thrilling
facts and pleasing fiction are well and judiciously
blended. The style is really
good, and the name of Agnes Stewart is
sufficient warrant that the tone is high
and unexceptionable. If there were anything
in a name, we might be disposed
to criticise it in this particular; for, in very
truth, the connection between the title
and the tale that hangs thereon is slight.
The story opens in Scotland, and the
bonny Highlands are kept pretty well in
view throughout, though the scene shifts
to England, France, and Germany, and
the curtain falls on a Christmas scene
by the frozen St. Lawrence. In a novel
such as this we do believe; it amuses, it
instructs; from such a book much valuable
history may be learned in a pleasing
way.</p>

<p>The publishers have done Miss Stewart
justice by giving to the public her
graceful story in an appropriate form.</p>

Landroit, Abp. of Rheims. Boston:
P. Donahoe. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">Mgr. Landroit is already favorably
known to the English reader by a series
of discourses for the use of women living
in the world, translated under the title
of <i>The Valiant Woman</i>. The present
work not only treats of the subject indicated
by the title, but also of “Envy and
Jealousy,” “Rash Judgments,” “Christian
Patience,” and “Grace”; and is intended
for those who would naturally
derive greater spiritual advantage from
thoughtful reading than from formal
meditation.</p>

<p>From the unrestful condition of things
in this age and country it probably
comes that there are fewer vocations to
a contemplative life, and less inclination
to habits of systematic contemplation,
than in older and more settled communities.
Hence, works like the present
are perhaps more appropriate to those
not consecrated to the religious state
than many of the ordinary books of
meditation. We therefore welcome it as
we do all judicious efforts to assist persons
in the world to perform the duties
to which they may be called, and to resist
the temptations by which they may
be assailed.</p>

<p>The Marthas are likely always to outnumber
the Marys, and should have
every assistance at the hands of those
capable of leading them in the path of
holiness. The church in this and similar
ways is ever adapting its aids to the
varying circumstances by which her
children may be surrounded.</p>

C. Donnelly. Philadelphia: Lippincott
&amp; Co. 1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This modest little volume, a “first
book,” gives us confidence that the authoress
will fill a useful place in the Catholic
literature of America. We say a
useful place, for poetry like hers is much
in demand in our Catholic homes.</p>

<p>The three divisions of the volume&mdash;“Sacred
Legends,” “Poems of the Civil
War,” and “Miscellaneous Poems”&mdash;present
a pleasing variety, both of matter
and of style. Some of her lyrics are
more accurate than others; and some of
her descriptions would be stronger with
fewer epithets. But her verse is, for the
most part, as smooth as simple. And
while no one can charge her with affectation,
she is certainly not lacking in
originality.</p>

<p>There is but a single line on which we
shall make a stricture. It occurs in a
poem called “The Skeleton at the
Feast”: the sixth line of the fifth stanza,
p. 77. She speaks of</p>

<div class="limit2">
<p class="pp8 p1">“The flame</p>
<p class="pp4">Lit for the damned <i>from all eternity</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p class="pn1">Now, God did not create “from eternity”;
still less are any of his creatures damned
“from eternity.” We therefore pronounce
this line a slip of the pen, and
beg that it may be altered in the next
edition.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we thankfully welcome
the authoress into the number of our Catholic
poetesses, and hope that ere long
she will be again tempted to come to us
“out of sweet solitude.”</p>

<p class="p1">Any one acquainted with the ancient

interest in the reminiscences which this
very readable book contains. To those
who are not, it will give a very perfect
idea of the New England of the past,
which is even now pretty well preserved

There is not a dry or tedious
page in it from beginning to end, and,
both in matter and style, it is just the
kind of a book for any time of year, but
particularly for the summer. At the end,
there are a number of ghost stories.

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> the history of American
Catholic literature comes to be written,
the name of John Gilmary Shea
will hold one of the most honorable
places in the record. So much rough
work has been needed to prepare the
ground for the American church, so
much polemical discussion has been
called forth by our peculiar position
in the midst of a hostile and prejudiced
community, so many problems
of philosophy and social science have
pressed upon us for consideration,
and the demand for books of education
and devotion has been so urgent,
that few of our writers have
found occasion to apply themselves
to strictly literary and historical studies
or to those branches of criticism
which are included in the department
of polite letters. And yet how
richly this neglected field of research
would repay the labors of the Catholic
investigator! The early history
of many parts of the North
American continent is only a chapter
in the history of the Catholic Church.
The most picturesque characters in
the early American annals are the
Catholic voyagers of France and
Spain, the settlers of Canada, and
Florida, and the Pacific coast, and
the missionaries who followed them
across the ocean, and pushed forward
in advance of them into the savage
wilderness. How tame and mean
appear the quarrels of the Plymouth
settlers with hostile Indians, and
rival adventurers, and preaching
sectaries, and bewitched old women,
after one has read of the heroism
of a Jogues and a Brebœuf,
and the romantic travels of the discoverer
of the Mississippi. The
settlement of Virginia was a prosaic
and commonplace affair beside the
settlement of Canada. The monks
who accompanied the armies of the
Spanish conquerors passed through
experiences of the most thrilling kind,
whose story has been only imperfectly
outlined in the glowing pages of
Prescott. Within the limits of the
present Union, the missionary has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>
been the chief actor in many an extraordinary
scene of dramatic interest,
and the hero of many a daring enterprise.
Simple-minded F. Mark traversing
the desert in search of the
seven mythical cities of New Mexico;
the gentle Marquette guiding his
canoe down the great river of the
West, and breathing his last prayer
on the shores of the mighty lake;
Hennepin, pattern of grotesque mendacity;
La Salle, model of a magnanimous
commander and a daring
explorer&mdash;such are among the infinite
variety of figures in the early Catholic
history of our country. Its
later annals are not inferior in interest
to the more remote. Even yet
the task of the pioneer is not complete,
and startling incidents are still
common in the chronicles of missionary
adventure.</p>

<p>No man has done more than Mr.
Shea to preserve the record of all
these events and all these personages.
For more than twenty years,
he has devoted himself to the study
of the old materials for American
Catholic history. He gave to the
world the first authentic and complete
narrative of the discovery and
exploration of the Mississippi, and
brought to light the manuscript narratives
of the actors in that most
important and striking achievement.
He prepared the only connected account
of the various Catholic missions
among the Indian tribes, from
the discovery of the country to the
present day. He was one of the
joint authors of the only general
history of the American church. To
these works, and a large number of
books of a miscellaneous character,
short histories, religious biographies,
statistical publications, etc., he has
recently added the result of patient
and learned research into the Indian
languages; he has recovered the
grammars and vocabularies prepared
by the old missionaries; he has
assisted in the preparation of various
works on the Indians printed at the
cost of the United States government;
he has edited an extraordinary
variety of historical collections
and monographs; and, finally, he has
prepared for the press a number of
hitherto unpublished narratives, memoirs,
and relations in connection
with the early French and Spanish
settlements. The value of these
publications can hardly be overstated.
The care and judgment of the
editor have been universally recognized
by the highest authorities; and
though Mr. Shea can hardly expect
an adequate pecuniary recompense
for his time, his labor, and his outlay,
he has been rewarded in a most
flattering way by the respect and
gratitude of historical students, Catholic
and Protestant alike.</p>

<p>His latest work is one of the most
laborious of his life, and one of the
most splendid in its results. It is a
translation, with notes, of the <i>History
and General Description of New
France</i>, from the French of the Rev.
P. F. X. de Charlevoix, S.J. The
first of the six sumptuous volumes
of this elegant work appeared from
the author’s own press in this city
in 1866, and the last was issued at
the close of 1872. As we shall see
further on, Mr. Shea has expended
upon the “translation and notes”
an extraordinary amount of pains of
which the modest title-page affords
no hint; but the book was well
worth the trouble. No history of
America can be written without a
constant reference to the labors of
F. Charlevoix. He is our best and
sometimes our only authority for the
transactions in all the French North
American settlements. Of many of
the scenes that he describes he was
an eye-witness. He was a diligent
and conscientious student; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
access to important and little-known
sources of information; he sympathized
with the sentiment of the early
French explorers, and caught as
by instinct the spirit of those curious
expeditions wherein the priest and
the peddler marched side by side
through the wilderness for the glory
of God and of France, and the
spread simultaneously of the Gospel
and the fur-trade. Born in the
north of France in 1682, Charlevoix
entered the Society of Jesus, and
was sent to the Canada mission
when he was about twenty-three
years old. He spent four years in
America, returning to France in
1709, and teaching philosophy for
some time in various colleges of his
society. Eleven years later, the
king sent him to make a tour among
the French settlements of the New
World, and a curious account of
this adventurous journey is preserved
in his <i>Journal of a Voyage to
North America</i>, a translation of
which was published in London in
1761. He landed at Quebec in
October, 1720, visited Montreal and
other settlements on the St. Lawrence,
and the following spring set
out on his remarkable canoe voyage
to the Gulf of Mexico. This took
him through Lakes Ontario, Erie,
Huron, and Michigan. On the 6th
of August, 1721, he entered the St.
Joseph River, at the southern end of
Lake Michigan. Thence by a tedious
portage he reached the head-waters
of the Kankakee. Towards
the end of September, he found himself
on the Illinois, and on the 9th
of October his frail bark floated on
the waters of the Mississippi. Stopping
at various posts along the bank,
he was nearly three months in reaching
New Orleans, whence he embarked
in April, 1722, for Santo
Domingo. Wrecked on one of the
Florida keys, he made his way back
to Louisiana in an open boat, and
at the end of June took ship again at
Biloxi. After touching at Havana,
and narrowly escaping another disaster,
he made Cape François, in
Santo Domingo, and there found a
merchant ship, which took him home.</p>

<p>Before starting on this extensive
and arduous tour, he had begun a
series of histories of all the countries
unknown to Europeans previous to
the XIVth century, giving to that
tolerably comprehensive portion of
the universe the general name of the
New World. The first instalment
of his task, a <i>History and Description
of Japan</i>, was printed at Rouen in
three volumes in 1715. He had no
expectation of completing the whole
series of proposed histories. That
was an enterprise beyond the powers
of one man; but “the same may be
said of this,” he remarked, “as of
the discovery of America: the worst
was done when it was once begun;
there is, then, every reason to believe
that it will be continued after me,
and that, if I have the advantage
of suggesting the idea, those who
succeed me will have the glory of
perfecting it.” The second fruit of
the scheme was the <i>History of Santo
Domingo</i>, which appeared at Paris
in two quarto volumes, in 1730. The
third was the <i>History of New France</i>,
in three quarto volumes, in 1744;
and there was a fourth book, a
<i>History of Paraguay</i>, in three quarto
volumes, in 1756. F. Charlevoix
died in 1761, having been for more
than twenty years one of the principal
workers on the famous <i>Journal
de Trévoux</i>.</p>

<p>Of the four works embraced in his
uncompleted series, three are little
known on this side of the ocean, except
in the libraries of the curious.
The <i>History of New France</i>, however,
has long enjoyed an American celebrity,
through the frequent references<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
to it in the pages of modern historians;
and Mr. Shea is not unreasonably
surprised that it should so long
have gone untranslated. Fidelity is
by no means its only merit. It is
well planned, and written with a
carefulness, simplicity, and good
judgment which give it a very respectable,
if not a very high, literary
character. Its style is not remarkable
for eloquence, but it is chaste
and direct. It is never ambitious,
but it is always agreeable; rarely
picturesque, but never dry. Prefixing
to his work a comprehensive
chronology of European explorations
and settlements in the New World
(taking that phrase in his own extended
application), and an excellent
bibliographical account of the numerous
authors whom he has consulted,
he begins his narrative proper
with the voyages of Cortereal and
Verazzano to Newfoundland, between
1500 and 1525. It is with
the expedition of Jacques Cartier,
however, in 1534, that the story of
the French settlements in North
America properly commences. Cartier
ascended the St. Lawrence,
visited the site of Montreal, and
planned a town there, though he did
not succeed in making a permanent
establishment. There is a curious
illustration in this part of the narrative
of the simplicity which gives
F. Charlevoix’s book such a peculiar
charm. Misled by an unfaithful
abridgment of Cartier’s narrative,
the good father gently rebukes the
traveller for certain marvellous tales
which he is unjustly accused of
bearing back to France: but there is
one strange story to which the reverend
historian is evidently more
than half disposed to attach credit.
An Indian named Donnacona is
reported to have told Cartier that in
a remote part of the land “were
men who had but one leg and thigh,
with a very large foot, two hands on
the same arm, the waist extremely
square, the breast and head flat, and
a very small mouth; that still further
on he had seen pigmies, and a
sea the water of which was fresh.
In fine, that, ascending the Saguenay,
you reach a country where there are
men dressed like us, who live in
cities, and have much gold, rubies,
and copper.” Now, by ascending
the Saguenay, Charlevoix conjectures,
and turning west, an Indian
might reach Lake Assiniboin, and
thence penetrate to New Mexico,
where the Spaniards had begun to
settle&mdash;a conjecture which certainly
betrays a rather loose idea of American
geography. The pigmies he
supposes to be the Esquimaux. But
of the men with one leg, he remarks
that the story is “very strange.” He
does not accept, but he certainly
does not reject it. Nay, he cites a
long account by an Esquimaux girl,
who was in Quebec while he was
there in 1720, of a kind of men
among her country people “who
had only one leg, one thigh, and a
very large foot, two hands on the
same arm, a broad body, flat head,
small eyes, scarcely any nose, and a
very small mouth”; they were always
in a bad humor, and could remain
under water three-quarters of
an hour at a time. “As for the
monstrous men,” he concludes, “described
by the slave of M. de Courtemanche
and by Donnacona, and
the headless men killed, it is pretended,
by an Iroquois hunter a few
years since while hunting, it is
easy to believe that there is some
exaggeration; but it is easier to deny
extraordinary facts than to explain
them; and, moreover, are we at liberty
to reject whatever we cannot explain?
Who can pretend to know
all the caprices and mysteries of
nature?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span></p>

<p>From Canada our historian passes
suddenly to Florida, which he defines
as “all that part of the continent
of America lying between
the two Mexicos, New France, and
North Carolina.” To this part of
the new world Admiral de Coligni
sent out a colony of Huguenots in
1562 under John de Ribaut, who
built a fort at Port Royal, near the
site of Beaufort, South Carolina. In
all the early settlements of America,
there is the same story to be told of
avarice and childish folly. The colonists
were not settlers, but adventurers.
They had come in search
of a land where they could grow
rich without work, and pick up gold
and silver with no more trouble than
the occasional killing of a few Indians.
They depended for sustenance
upon what they brought from
France and the provisions they
might purchase from the savages.
But there was little to be obtained
from a race of hunters who were
half the year themselves on the
brink of starvation, and the fresh
supplies promised from home were
often delayed. It is almost incredible
that no attempt should have
been made to cultivate the fertile
lands upon which they established
themselves; but year after year the
same blunder was repeated: winter
found the adventurers famishing;
and promising colonies were broken
up by their reckless improvidence.
Such was the fate of Ribaut’s settlement
at Port Royal. The commander
had gone home to obtain re-enforcements.
When the re-enforcements
arrived under Laudonniere in
1564, Port Royal had been abandoned.
The colonists had built a
vessel, caulked the seams with moss,
twisted the bark of trees for ropes,
used their shirts for sails, and, with
a short supply of provisions and
a crew composed of soldiers, had
put to sea. They suffered terribly.
The water gave out, and some died
of thirst. After they had eaten their
last shoe and their last scrap of
leather, a soldier named Lachau
offered the sacrifice of his own life
to save the rest. They ate Lachau,
and drank his blood. Soon afterward,
they sighted land, and about
the same time fell in with an English
vessel.</p>

<p>Laudonniere established himself
on the St. John’s River, in Florida.
F. Charlevoix tells an interesting
story of his curious dealings with the
Indians and the dissensions of his
disorderly colonists. He seems to
have been upon the whole a fair
commander, but the fatal mistake
of all these adventurers soon brought
him to the brink of ruin. Provisions
gave out. The expected relief from
France was delayed. Fish and game
grew scarce. In July, 1567, Laudonniere
was trying to patch up his
one small vessel to return home,
when he was unexpectedly relieved
by a visit from Sir John Hawkins
with four English ships. Hawkins
treated the suffering Frenchmen
with great generosity. He gave
them bread and wine, replenished
their stores of clothing and munitions,
offered the whole party a passage
home to France, and finally
persuaded them to purchase one of
his vessels which was better fitted
for their use than their own. Laudonniere
now hastened his preparations
for the voyage, and was actually
weighing anchor, when Ribaut
entered the river with seven vessels,
and set about restoring the dismantled
Fort Caroline, and planning
an expedition after gold to the distant
mountains of Apalache. But
this whole chapter is a tale of surprises.
Six days after the arrival of
Ribaut, another squadron appeared
at the mouth of the river. It consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
of six Spanish ships under the
command of Don Pedro Menendez,
whom Philip II. had despatched to
conquer Florida, and drive out the
heretics.</p>

<p>The story now becomes a horrible
narrative of battle, treachery, and
murder. Menendez attacked the
French vessels without doing much
injury, and then, hastening southward
to the spot which he had already
selected as the site of a settlement,
began the building of St.
Augustine. From St. Augustine he
marched with five hundred men
through the swamps, in the midst of
a long and violent storm, surprised
Fort Caroline, and put most of the
garrison to the sword. At the spot
of the execution, Menendez erected
a stone with the inscription, “I do
this, not as to Frenchmen, but as to
Lutherans.” Nearly three years afterwards,
Dominic de Gourgues, after
a semi-piratical cruise along the
coast of Africa and among the West
India Islands, crossed over from
Cuba to the mainland to avenge the
slaughter of his countrymen. He
reached the fort unsuspected, and
took it by escalade, with the help of
a large force of Indians. Then the
prisoners were led to the scene of
the former massacre, and all hanged
upon a tree, with the inscription:
“I do this, not as to Spaniards nor
as to maranes,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> but as to traitors,
robbers, and murderers.” Such is
the story of Dominic de Gourgues,
as Charlevoix gives it after contemporary
French accounts. No Spanish
version of it is known to exist,
and Mr. Shea points out in a note
the reasons for regarding it with
some suspicion. The conqueror
could not hold what he had won.
Burning the fort, and destroying all
the plunder that he was unable to
carry away, he hastened back to
France; and so ended the history
of French Florida.</p>

<p>It was about thirty years after
this that the Marquis de la Roche,
a gentleman of Brittany, received
from Henri IV. a commission as
lieutenant-general of the king “in
the countries of Canada, Hochelaga,
Newfoundland, Labrador, River of
the Great Bay [St. Lawrence], Norimbegue,
and adjacent lands,” and
fitted out a vessel to explore his
territory. Landing on Sable Island,
ninety miles from the mainland of
Nova Scotia (1598), he left there a
colony of forty convicts whom he
had drawn from the French prisons,
coasted awhile along the shores of
Acadia (Nova Scotia), without accomplishing
anything of value, and
then went back to France. Contrary
winds prevented his taking off
the wretched colony of Sable Island,
and it was not until seven years later
that the king, hearing of the adventure,
sent a ship to their relief. Only
twelve remained alive, and these
were brought to court in the same
guise in which they were found,
“covered with sealskin, with hair
and beard of a length and disorder
that made them resemble the pretended
river-gods, and so disfigured
as to inspire horror. The king gave
them fifty crowns apiece, and sent
them home released from all process
of law.” The expedition of De
Monts and Pontgravé (1604) was
more fortunate. It resulted in the
settlement of Port Royal (Annapolis)
by M. de Poutrincourt, under a
grant from M. de Monts, afterwards
confirmed by the crown; it brought
forward Samuel de Champlain, who
was soon to play so distinguished a
part in the exploration and settlement
of Canada; and it offered a
career to the Jesuit missionaries,
whose heroism reflected so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
glory upon the colony. The king
had intimated to M. de Poutrincourt,
when he confirmed the grant
of Port Royal, that it was proper to
invite the Jesuits to the new colony;
and, by his majesty’s desire, two
priests were selected from the many
who volunteered to go. These were F.
Peter Biard and F. Enemond Masse.
Strange to say, the first difficulties
they encountered were from their own
countrymen. “M. de Poutrincourt
was a very worthy man,” says
Charlevoix, “sincerely attached to
the Catholic religion; but the calumnies
of the so-called Reformers
had produced an impression on his
mind, and he was fully determined
not to take them to Port Royal.
He did not, however, show anything
of this to the king, who, having
given his orders, had no doubt
but that they were executed with
all speed. The Jesuits thought
so; and F. Biard, at the commencement
of the year [1608],
proceeded to Bordeaux, where he
was assured the embarkation would
take place. He was much surprised
to see no preparation there; and he
waited in vain for a whole year. The
king, informed of this, reproached
M. de Poutrincourt sharply; and
the latter pledged his word to the
king that he would no longer defer
obeying his orders. He actually
prepared to go; but, as he said
nothing of embarking the missionaries,
F. Cotton paid him a visit, to
bring him to do so in a friendly
way. Poutrincourt begged him to
be good enough to postpone it till
the following year, as Port Royal
was by no means in a condition to
receive the fathers. So frivolous a
reason was regarded by F. Cotton
as a refusal, but he did not deem it
expedient to press the matter or inform
the king. M. de Poutrincourt
accordingly sailed for Acadia; and,
with a view of showing the court
that the ministry of the Jesuits was
not necessary in the conversion of
the heathen, he had scarcely arrived
before he sent the king a list of
twenty-five Indians baptized in
haste.” Meanwhile, the king died,
and Poutrincourt considered himself
thereupon released from his obligation.
It was in this difficulty that
the Marchioness de Guercheville,
whose name is so honorably associated
with American adventure, declared
herself the protectress of the
missions. But the story of the
troubles which this powerful advocate
had to overcome gives us a
curious idea of the manner in which
American affairs were regulated at
the French court. Biencourt, the
son of M. de Poutrincourt, was about
sailing for Acadia, and consented to
take the missionaries. When the
fathers reached Dieppe, Biencourt
had changed his mind, or been overruled
by his two Huguenot partners,
and passage was refused. Mme. de
Guercheville had recourse to the
queen mother, who gave a peremptory
order that the Jesuits should
be taken on board. The order was
laughed at, and nobody attempted
to enforce it. Then Mme. de Guercheville
raised a subscription, bought
off the two Calvinists, and proceeded
to treat with Biencourt. Not
finding his title clear, she purchased
of M. de Monts all his lapsed privileges,
with the purpose of reviving
them, and formed a partnership with
Biencourt, under which the subsistence
of the missionaries was to be
drawn from the fishery and fur trade.
Thus at last a woman accomplished
what the king had failed in, and F.
Biard and F. Masse reached the scene
of their labors in 1611.</p>

<p>Mme. de Guercheville soon fell
out with Poutrincourt, and resolved
to found a colony of her own. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
despatched a ship under the Sieur de
la Saussaye in 1613. The settlers
landed on Mount Desert, and there
began a settlement, bringing FF.
Biard and Masse from Port Royal,
and having with them also two
other Jesuits, a priest named Quentin,
and a lay brother, Du Thet.
The narrative of the destruction of
this settlement as well as Port Royal
by the English free-booting adventurer
Argall, from Virginia, is familiar
to all American readers. The
colony had not yet assumed a regulated
form when the Englishman
swept down upon it, carried some of
the settlers to Virginia, and sent the
rest to sea in a small bark. The latter,
among whom was F. Masse, were
picked up by a French ship, and
carried to St. Malo. The others,
after much harsh treatment at Jamestown
from Sir Thomas Dale, were
taken back to Acadia with an expedition
sent to complete the demolition
of the French posts. Argall
performed his task thoroughly, and
set sail again for Virginia. Of his
three vessels, scattered in a storm,
one was lost; another, under his
own command, reached Jamestown
in safety; the third, bearing Fathers
Biard and Quentin (Brother du Thet
had been killed in Argall’s first attack),
and having one Turnell for
captain, was driven to the Azores,
and forced to seek shelter at Fayal.
Here the Jesuits had only to complain
of the outrages to which they
had been subjected, and they would
have been at once avenged. Turnell
was alarmed, and begged them
to keep concealed when the officers
of the port visited his vessel. “They
consented with good grace. The
visit over, the English captain had
liberty to buy all that he needed,
after which he again weighed anchor,
and the rest of his voyage was
fortunate. But he found himself in
a new embarrassment on arriving in
England: he had no commission,
and, although he represented that
he had accidentally been separated
from his commander, he was looked
upon as a deserter from Virginia,
and put in prison, from which he
was released only on the testimony
of the Jesuits. After this time, he
was unwearied in publishing the
virtue of the missionaries, twice his
liberators, and especially the service
they had done him at Fayal, where
they returned good for evil as they
so generously did, foregoing all the
advantages which they might have
obtained by making themselves
known. Nothing, indeed, was omitted
to compensate for them in England,
where they were very kindly
treated as long as they remained.”</p>

<p>The settlements in Canada proper,
however, were now firmly established,
and Quebec was rapidly becoming
prosperous. The early history of
this town, the adventures and discoveries
of Champlain, the expeditions
of the settlers against the
Iroquois, and the surrender of Quebec
to the English under Kirk (or
Kertk), who was a Frenchman by
birth, though an officer in the English
service, are told by F. Charlevoix
at considerable length. It was in
1629 that Quebec fell, and three
years afterwards the whole colony
was restored to France by the treaty
of St. Germain. Champlain returned
with the title of Governor of New
France in 1633, and began at once
that zealous and enlightened career
of missionary labor by which he has
won so glorious a fame. For we
may well style him a missionary.
Entrusted with the temporal government
of the young colony, it was not
his part to explore the wilderness
with crucifix and missal, to venture
into the cabins of the savages as a
teacher of the Gospel, to brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
martyrdom, to suffer unheard-of
tortures, even to the stake; but he
nevertheless fulfilled an important,
an almost indispensable, function in
the establishment of the Canada missions.
He was the best friend and
patron of the Jesuits and other
heroes who gave their lives so freely
among the Indians. He took care
that a number of these devoted
priests should be invited to the
colony, and that the settlers themselves
should give an example of
Christian demeanor that might do
credit to their teachers. “In a
short time,” says Charlevoix, “almost
all who composed the new colony
were seen to follow the example of
their governor, and make an open
and sincere profession of piety. The
same attention was continued in
subsequent years, and there soon
arose in this part of America a generation
of true Christians, among
whom reigned the simplicity of the
primitive ages of the church, and
whose posterity have not lost sight
of the great example left them by
their ancestors. The consolation
which such a change afforded the
laborers appointed to cultivate this
transplanted vineyard so sweetened
the crosses of the most painful mission
ever perhaps established in the
New World, that what they wrote
to their brethren in France created
among them a real eagerness to go
and share their labors. The annual
<i>Relations</i> which we have of these
happy times, and the constant tradition
preserved in the country, both
attest that there was an indescribable
unction attached to this Indian mission
which made it preferred to
many others infinitely more brilliant
and even more fruitful.” Champlain’s
career, however, as governor
was unhappily too short. He died
on Christmas day, in 1635. “He
may well be called,” says the historian,
“the father of New France.
He had good sense, much penetration,
very upright views, and no man
was ever more skilled in adopting
a course in the most complicated
affairs. What all admired most in
him was his constancy in following
up his enterprises; his firmness in
the greatest dangers; a courage
proof against the most unforeseen
reverses and disappointments; ardent
and disinterested patriotism;
a heart tender and compassionate
for the unhappy, and more attentive
to the interests of his friends than
his own; a high sense of honor, and
great probity. His memoirs show
that he was not ignorant of anything
that one of his profession should
know; and we find in him a faithful
and sincere historian, an attentively
observant traveller, a judicious
writer, a good mathematician, and
an able mariner. But what crowns
all these good qualities is the fact
that in his life, as well as in his writings,
he shows himself always a truly
Christian man, zealous for the service
of God, full of candor and religion.
He was accustomed to say, what we
read in his memoirs, ‘that the salvation
of a single soul was worth more
than the conquest of an empire, and
that kings should seek to extend
their domain in heathen countries
only to subject them to Christ.’”</p>

<p>We have insensibly gone deeper
into these attractive volumes than
we intended, and we must pass over
the remaining books, which record
the growth of the Canadian settlements,
the wars with the Indians
after Champlain’s death, the hostilities
with the English, and the progress
of the missions. Neither can
we linger over the fascinating story
of Marquette’s voyage down the
Mississippi, or the expeditions, of
La Salle, or the various attempts at
colonizing the shores of the Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
Gulf. What little space remains for
us we must give to an examination
of a portion of Mr. Shea’s labor
which has not yet been duly estimated.
He has given much more than
a translation of F. Charlevoix’s <i>Histoire</i>.
The text is rendered with great
care, and we presume with great
faithfulness, into simple, graceful,
and idiomatic English. The peculiarities
of the original, in the orthography
of proper names and in other
particulars, are all preserved. It is
indeed Charlevoix’s work, as exactly
as any work can be reproduced in a
language different from its author’s.
But Mr. Shea has bestowed upon it
an editorial supervision which nearly
doubles its value. With extraordinary
zeal, learning, and intelligence,
he has traced almost every
statement to its source, collated rare
authorities, and in modest and compact
foot-notes, whose number must
amount to several thousands, has
corrected errors, identified localities,
and thrown a perfect flood of light
upon doubtful passages and controverted
statements. The patient industry,
the rare judgment, and the
unassuming scholarship which Mr.
Shea has brought to the execution
of this noble task can only be appreciated
by one who has studied
his work with some care, and to
whom familiarity with the subject
has taught something of its difficulties.
He has not only been at the
pains of consulting the authors to
whom F. Charlevoix expressly refers,
weighing the soundness of F.
Charlevoix’s conclusions from their
testimony, and correcting his citations,
but he has made it a point to
discover the authorities whom the
good father followed without quoting,
and he has often pursued devious
statements backward through a score
of forgotten books, until he has
reached at last the sober truth from
which they started. Doing this without
parade, without verbosity, and
with an icy impartiality, Mr. Shea has
approved himself a model editor.</p>

<p>The outward appearance of the
six volumes will delight the heart of
the fastidious collector. Such beautiful
and symmetrical arrangement
of the generous pages, such royal
elegance of type, such rich and refined
tints, such noble margins, and
such magnificent paper&mdash;every leaf
stout enough to stand alone&mdash;these
things make up the gorgeous apparel
in which the work has been dressed,
we may say, by Mr. Shea’s own
hands. Excellent engravings add
not merely to its appearance but its
value. There are steel-plate portraits
of governors, adventurers, and
missionaries; there are fac-similes
of autographs; there are copies of
curious old maps and plans. Finally,
the book is furnished with a copious
and systematic index&mdash;and
so Mr. Shea shows himself conscientious
alike as an editor and
publisher.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p class="pc1">THE ENEMY ON EITHER HAND.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">What</span> I have just related took
place in the month of August. I
was at that time extremely anxious
about Victor, but an unexpected
improvement took place in his condition
after Louis’ visit. Alas! he was
never to rally again.</p>

<p>Louis sent every morning for some
time to know how his sick friend
was, but he only came to see us
once, and then merely for a few
minutes. He only left St. M&mdash;&mdash;
with regret. He seemed to feel that,
in absenting himself, he left the field
clear to his bold rival, as it was now
evident he was, and at a time when
an attack was threatened against
what he cherished the most&mdash;the
good work he had begun, and Eugénie’s
affection. He did not, therefore,
inform us at that time of all I
have just related. On the contrary,
we were left in a state of painful
incertitude. But I had every detail
at a later day, even the very thoughts
of both parties, and from their own
lips.</p>

<p>However, Albert was not fitted to
play the part of a man of gravity or
that of a hypocrite for a long time.
For that, more perseverance and
ability than he had were required. A
frivolous man like him may, by careful
watch over himself, assume an
appearance of thoughtfulness, but he
will soon show himself in his true
colors through weariness, or at an
unguarded moment. He had hardly
been in the house a fortnight before
he unconsciously showed what he
was at the bottom of his heart. He
rose at a late hour, he resumed his
habit of careful attention to his toilet,
he lounged about from morning till
night, conversing only of trivial
things or discussing points he was
ignorant of, and read romances of a
doubtful character, which, so far from
hiding, he left about in his room.
Eugénie kept an eye open to all
these things. She watched her cousin
with the natural persistency she
inherited from her father; she drew
her own conclusions, and ended by
treating him just as she used to do,
like a spoiled child she loved because
he was a relative, but would not,
on any account, have for a husband.
Albert tried now and then to resume
his gravity; he went to church, and
discussed the loftiest themes. Vain
efforts! His uncle and cousin knew
what to think of it all. Albert perceived
it, and was inwardly furious.</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson alone manifested
an ever-increasing fondness for him.
Her affection for his mother as well
as himself, and her acknowledged
but constant wish for Mr. Smithson’s
property to come into the possession
of her own family by the marriage
of the two cousins, inclined her towards
her nephew. But of what
account was Mme. Smithson in the
house? Very little. Albert was under
no illusion on this point, and
therefore had never attached much
importance to his aunt’s support.
For two or three days he exulted
over the stratagem he had formed for
awakening unfavorable sentiments
in his cousin’s heart toward the engineer.
But Eugénie’s suspicions
could not last long without her seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
an explanation. Then all would
be lost, for Albert felt that Louis did
not love Madeleine. If, on the other
hand, Eugénie was not in love with
Louis, she would keep her conjectures
to herself, and merely withdraw
her favor from him.</p>

<p>Albert’s affairs, therefore, had not
in any respect taken the turn he
hoped in the beginning. “What
can be done? What can be done?”
he said to himself. “I must devise
some way of getting rid of this fellow
who is disturbing my uncle and Eugénie’s
peace of mind so much.
Things must be brought to a crisis.
If Louis were only dismissed, my
cousin in her despair would accept
me as her husband. My uncle would
manifest no opposition out of regard
for his wife, and because, after all, I
should not be a troublesome son-in-law.
At all events, I should have
the satisfaction of routing a creature
I detest. Whether Eugénie loves
him or not, I can never, no, never
suffer this artful man to marry her.
If my coming only serves to drive
him away, I shall be glad I came.”</p>

<p>Such calculations were extremely
base and dishonorable, but it must
be remembered that Albert was devoid
of piety, he coveted his cousin’s
dowry, and his antipathy to Louis
became stronger every day. People
destitute of moral principle and religious
faith hate those who possess
the good qualities they lack themselves.
Albert had tried in vain to
blind himself with regard to Louis;
but the more he studied him, the
more clearly he saw he was incontestably
a man of great depth, sincere
piety, and uncommon energy.
At first he doubted his worth, but he
could question it no longer.</p>

<p>Eugénie during this time was
extremely sad and preoccupied,
though no one would have suspected
what was passing in the depths
of her soul. The poor girl could
no longer conceal it from herself:
she loved Louis. But she was still
uncertain as to his love for her.
She even asked herself&mdash;and this
was an additional torture&mdash;if he was
worthy of the affection she bore
him. You will not be astonished
if I add that, romantic as Eugénie
was, she was a woman to be driven
in such a conjuncture to the very
step Albert was aiming at. Only
one thing was wanting to effect this&mdash;the
necessity of withdrawing her
esteem from Louis. In a noble
nature like hers, it would have
quenched her love and broken her
very heart to despise the object of
her affections.</p>

<p>Affairs were in this condition
when a new incident came to the
aid of Albert’s schemes. Mr. Smithson,
it will be well to recall, was
not originally a manufacturer of
paper. A dishonest broker, or one
who lacked shrewdness, led him
into a succession of unfortunate
speculations. Repeated losses were
the result. Mr. Smithson perceived
his property was diminishing in an
alarming manner. He at once settled
up his affairs, and, by the advice
of Louis’ father, bought the
mill at St. M&mdash;&mdash;, the proprietor
of which had just died. This was
in every respect an advantageous
investment: First, it withdrew him
from the arena of stock speculations,
where fortune, conscience, and honor
are daily risked; in the next
place, the mill he purchased brought
in a fine income. But it was no
small affair to conduct such an enterprise,
employing as it did five or
six hundred workmen.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson’s predecessor, a
man perfectly familiar with the
business, directed the establishment
himself. Everything went on prosperously,
and Mr. Smithson wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
to imitate him. In a few months,
he saw he was going wrong. The
workmen were indolent, the machinery
deteriorated, everything was
going to ruin. It is not sufficient to
be methodical, intelligent, and energetic,
in order to conduct a manufacturing
concern; a man must have
a special knowledge of mechanics
and a faculty of adaptation which
Mr. Smithson did not possess. He
became conscious of this, and resolved
to obtain a book-keeper of probity
and intelligence to keep his accounts,
and an engineer equally versed
in his business. They were both
soon found, but the book-keeper
alone proved suitable. The engineer
had practical knowledge enough,
but was deficient in energy. The
workmen and overseers soon perceived
it, and profited by it to do
less and less. The engineer was
discharged and Louis chosen to fill
his place.</p>

<p>From the time of Louis’ arrival,
the aspect of everything changed.
The workmen felt they now had a
superintendent to deal with that was
inflexible but just. The overseers
alone were inclined to resist his authority.
They were sharply reprimanded,
and the most mutinous
discharged. Mr. Smithson, warned
by his previous experience, seconded
Louis with all the weight of his
authority. He gave him absolute
control of the manufactory when he
was absent, and never failed to
come to his support whenever Louis
found severe measures necessary.</p>

<p>All this did not take place, it may
well be supposed, without exciting
some murmurs and secret rancor.
Among the foremost of those most
dissatisfied with this necessary rigor
was an overseer by the name of Durand,
who came to the mill some
months before Louis. He was a
man of about forty years of age, of
lofty stature, a sombre face expressive
of energy, and grave and fluent
of speech. He came provided with
the best recommendations, but it was
afterwards learned they were forged.
This man succeeded both in intimidating
the engineer who preceded
Louis, and acquiring his favor.
Half through fear, and half weakness,
he allowed Durand to assume
an authority he abused in many
ways. When Louis replaced this
weak man so afraid of Durand, there
was more than one contest between
him and the overseer. Their last
altercation had been very violent.
Durand insulted the engineer before
all the workmen, and in so bold a
manner that Mr. Smithson, informed
of what had taken place, at once
discharged him. Rather than give
up his situation, Durand submitted
to the humiliation of begging Louis’
pardon. Notwithstanding this, he
was merely kept on sufferance,
though he was well paid, for he was
clever in his way, and in one sense a
model overseer: no one kept better
discipline.</p>

<p>Astonishing as it may seem, when
Louis instituted the evening-school,
Durand was the first to offer his assistance,
and was appointed monitor.
One thing, however, tried Louis: his
monitor, always polite and respectful
to his face, was in the habit of
whispering behind his back, as if
secretly conniving with the men.
But nothing occurred to justify his
suspicions, and Louis at length ceased
to attach any importance to the
overseer’s strange ways. When the
night-school closed, about half-past
eight, Durand went away a little before
Louis to finish the evening at
the St. M&mdash;&mdash; café, which was greatly
frequented by the inhabitants of
the place. There he gambled and
harangued at his ease, and acquired
the reputation of being the ablest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span>
talker in the country around. As to
his political opinions, they were not
positively known. He was suspected
of being a demagogue, and even
an ultra one, but there was no proof
of it. He was less secret about his
religious belief. He called himself a
Protestant, and a thorough one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Albert began to find
the life he was leading at his uncle’s
wearisome and monotonous. The
evenings especially seemed interminable.
Mr. Smithson read, Mme.
Smithson was absorbed in her tapestry,
and Eugénie played on the
piano. Albert did not know what
to do with himself. He did not
dare have recourse to a novel; conversation
with his aunt was not very
enlivening; and, if he addressed
himself to Eugénie, she showed so
much skill in embarrassing him on
every subject that he avoided the
occasion of appearing to so much
disadvantage. Besides, Eugénie’s
superiority irritated him. Had it
not been for her fortune, which he
found more and more attractive,
and her beauty, to which he could
not remain insensible, he would at
once have given up all thoughts of
marrying her. But her property on
the one hand, and her beauty on
the other, deterred him. However,
with his frivolous mind, he soon
found it intolerable to be confined
to his cousin’s society every evening,
even for the purpose of paying court
to her. One night, it suddenly occurred
to him to go to the café, and
after that he went there regularly
after dinner to pass an hour. He
was welcomed very cordially, especially
by Durand, who at once made
every effort to win his favor. The
wily overseer was so profuse in respectful
attentions that in a few evenings
they were friends. Durand, with
his uncommon penetration, soon discovered
from some indiscreet words
Albert dropped what was troubling
his shallow mind. He could see he
was desirous of marrying his cousin,
and so suspicious of Louis that he
detested him and asked for nothing
better than to see him dismissed.
Durand at once resolved to gain Albert’s
friendship and profit by it to
involve Louis in some inextricable
embarrassment. He was determined
to have his revenge at whatever
cost, but it was necessary to proceed
with caution. He began by sounding
Albert to make sure of his antipathy
to Louis, that he really wished
for his dismissal, and if he cared
what means were employed provided
the end was attained.</p>

<p>Durand gave himself no rest till
he was sure of all this&mdash;a certitude
he acquired the day when Albert, impatient
at the unfavorable progress
of his affairs, resolved to bring things
to a sudden crisis by having Louis
dismissed, if possible. The overseer
waited till Albert left the café, and
then proposed he should accompany
him to the manufactory, where he
lodged.</p>

<p>“Willingly, my good fellow,” said
Albert. It was a fine evening in
the month of September. They set
off together by the road that ran
along the river half-hidden among
trees, through which the moon diffused
its purest radiance.</p>

<p>“We do not see you any more at
the mill,” said Durand. “I daresay
I could guess why you have stopped
visiting the school.... Would there
be any indiscretion in telling you the
reason that has occurred to me?”</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if I am not mistaken,
there is some one at the mill not
exactly to your liking.... Yes,
somebody keeps you away....”</p>

<p>“That may be.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I am no fool. I think I
have found out the cause of our being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
deprived of your visits. It must
have been something serious. See
if I haven’t some wit left.... The
person you dislike is M. Louis, is it
not?”</p>

<p>“You are right, my friend,” replied
Albert, patting Durand on the
shoulder in a familiar manner.</p>

<p>“There are others who do not
like him any better than you.”</p>

<p>“Not you? You are his assistant
at the school, and seem on the best
of terms with him.”</p>

<p>“<i>Seem?</i> Yes, I seem; but to seem
and be are sometimes very different
things. Listen: the very instant I
saw you&mdash;excuse my frankness&mdash;you
inspired me with so much confidence
that, faith, I feel inclined to tell you
all that is on my mind. It would do
me good.”</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid of my betraying
you, <i>mon cher</i>; speak to me as a
friend.”</p>

<p>“O monsieur! you are too kind.
Well, since you allow me, I tell
you plainly I do not like that man;
no, not at all.”</p>

<p>“He has been insolent and overbearing
towards you, I know.”</p>

<p>“If that were all, I could forgive
him. But it is not a question of
myself. I dislike, I detest him for
another reason. Whoever likes Mr.
Smithson cannot like the engineer,
as I can convince anybody who
wishes it.”</p>

<p>“Explain yourself; I do not exactly
understand you.”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;but swear you will never
repeat what I am going to say.”</p>

<p>“I give you my word, which I
never break.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, this M. Louis is a
Tartuffe&mdash;a Jesuit; such men are
dangerous. Woe to the houses they
enter! He has wasted all his property,
we know how! It is a shame!...
Then he artfully obtained a
place in your uncle’s mill, where he
has assumed more and more authority;
he tries to influence the minds
of the workmen; he ... wishes to
marry your cousin.... <i>Parbleu!</i> I
may as well say aloud what everybody
is saying in secret.”</p>

<p>“Do they say that, Durand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the report. But his
art and hypocrisy are in vain. More
than one of us understand his projects....
And let me assure you
we tremble lest he succeed! There
will be fine doings when the mill
passes into the hands of this Jesuit,
who will spend all of Mr. Smithson’s
property, and prepare him a pitiful
old age. Do you see now why I
cannot endure that man? Oh! if I
were master I would soon set him a-flying....
But I am not the master, ...
it is he who is likely to be. If
somebody could only get him dismissed!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Albert, in a conceited
tone. “There is some truth
in what you say&mdash;a great deal, in
fact.... Since I have been here, I
have watched and studied his movements,
and agree with you that it
was rather an unlucky day for my
uncle when he admitted this intriguer
into his house. His schemes make
me anxious.”</p>

<p>“Is there no way of defeating
them?”</p>

<p>“It would be no easy matter.”</p>

<p>“Come, now! As if you, Mr.
Smithson’s nephew; you who have
more learning than all of us put together&mdash;who
have more wit than I,
though I am no fool&mdash;as if you could
not send him adrift if you wished to!...
You could never make me believe
that.”</p>

<p>“What can I do? I certainly
ask for nothing better than to get
him into some difficulty; but how?
He performs his duties with exasperating
fidelity.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is not on that score you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>
must attack him; he is too cunning
to be at fault there.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he is not at fault, do you
wish me to make him out so?”</p>

<p>“Precisely. That is what must be
done. See here, M. Albert, as you
know of no way, I will tell you an
idea that has come into my head; for
I have been a long time contriving
some means of driving that man
away. But I must first warn you
not to take my plan for more than it
is worth. If it is not a good one, we
will try to discover a better one.”</p>

<p>“Let us hear it.”</p>

<p>“We have an Englishman at the
mill who tells me he does not intend
to remain. This man has been to
the evening-school several times. M.
Louis has lent him religious books....
Can’t you guess what I am
at?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is my plan. The man
I refer to and I are linked together.
It would be a long story to tell how
and why. If I should go to him&mdash;to-morrow,
for instance&mdash;and say:
‘Adams, I know you intend leaving
St. M&mdash;&mdash;. Will you do your friend
a favor before you go? Rid me of
that engineer. I do not mean for
you to kill him or do him any harm:
we are neither of us murderers. I
simply propose you should play him
some trick, as they call it. You are
on good terms with him: he lends
you books. Go and tell him you
have come to consult him about
some doubts on the subject of religion.
Beg him to enlighten you.
Ask for some controversial works,
and cautiously insinuate the possibility
of abjuring your religion. You
will naturally be open in your projects.
You will even talk of them
with an air of profound conviction.
This will cause some noise. I shall
then take hold of it. In case of necessity,
I shall have a violent dispute
with the engineer, which of
course will oblige Mr. Smithson to
interfere.’ I know he is not disposed
to jest about such matters. Once
the affair is brought before him, the
engineer is lost. I will not give him
a week to remain at the mill after
that.... Such is my idea; what
do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Durand, you are a genius.
Your plan is admirable. The moment
my uncle finds the engineer is
trying to propagate his religion, he
is lost, as you say. You must put
your project into execution without
any delay.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you approve of
it, not only because it flatters my
self-love, but because it makes me
more hopeful of success. I should
be better satisfied, however, if you
would promise to help us in case
you are needed.... We are not
sure of succeeding in our plan. The
engineer is cunning, and Mr. Smithson’s
way of acting is not always
easy to foresee. And if we should
fail&mdash;if I get into difficulty!...”</p>

<p>“I promise to stand by you.
Rest assured I shall not be backward
in trying my utmost to influence
my uncle against him. This
will be easy, for he already distrusts
the engineer. Nevertheless, admonish
your friend to be extremely cautious.
No one must have the slightest
suspicion of the scheme. Success
then would be impossible.”</p>

<p>“Adams does not lack wit. He
will know how to manage. But one
thing alarms me, and will him. If
his conversion were to offend Mr.
Smithson to such a degree as to
cause his dismissal in disgrace!
Where could he go without recommendations?”</p>

<p>“Why, how simple you are! All
this can be turned to his advantage.
As soon as he sees my uncle irritated,
he must ask for a private interview,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
consult him as to his belief,
and pretend to yield to his arguments.
He must end by avowing
his determination to remain a Protestant,
and declaring he had been led
away by the engineer. The result is
evident.”</p>

<p>“You are sharper than I. I did
not think of that. Your idea makes
everything safe, and settles the matter.”</p>

<p>“And when shall the first shot be
fired?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But one question more.... It
would be vexatious if the engineer
refused the bait and sent Adams
a-walking.”</p>

<p>“No danger of that. The engineer
is a genuine fanatic. I am sure
of that, and I have had an opportunity
of judging.”</p>

<p>While thus conversing, our two
conspirators had nearly reached the
mill. They separated without being
seen. Albert was radiant. As he
retired, he said to himself: “Why
did I not think of this scheme myself?...
It is so simple, and
cannot fail! A saint like the engineer
will risk everything to gain a
soul.... And yet, if he should be
afraid, as Durand said; if he is only
a Catholic outwardly!... That
would be embarrassing! Strange!
for once, I hope the fellow is sincere!...”</p>

<p>The following morning, Durand
took a private opportunity of giving
his associate his instructions, and
that night Adams begged Louis to
grant him an interview in his room
after school.</p>

<p>The interview took place. Durand
had only told the truth: Adams was
an artful fellow&mdash;one of those men
who conceal uncommon duplicity
under the appearance of perfect candor.
He had been Durand’s tool
for a long time. The latter had
rendered him more than one service,
and employed him in numerous
fraudulent transactions, which he
generously rewarded him for. Durand
lent money upon pledge to
workmen in difficulty. He unlawfully
appropriated a thousand small objects
in the manufactory, and had
them sold. His assistant in this dishonest
traffic, his man of business, as
he called him, was Adams, who was
well paid, as may be supposed.</p>

<p>The Englishman, cunning as he
was, had some difficulty in persuading
Louis he was serious in his intention
of abjuring his religion. But
he dwelt on his doubts with such
apparent sincerity, he manifested so
strong a desire to be rescued from
error, if he was in error, that Louis
immediately proposed he should consult
the <i>curé</i>. Adams pretended the
<i>curé</i> intimidated him; he was more at
his ease with Louis, and could talk
to him with perfect openness of
heart. “If I have to go to the
<i>curé</i>” said he, “well, then, I shall
defer it. I do not wish to expose
myself to observations that would
not fail to be made. After all, monsieur,”
he added, “I am only in
doubt. I am not yet convinced of
being in error. When I see clearly
I am, oh! then I will no longer conceal
my sentiments. But meanwhile,
I do not wish everybody to know
what is passing in my soul.”</p>

<p>These plausible statements banished
Louis’ suspicions. He received
the young man in his room several
evenings in succession. He lent
him a small book, easy of comprehension,
that contained a thorough
refutation of Protestantism. Poor
Louis! he behaved with genuine heroism
on this occasion. From the
first he foresaw all the trouble such
an affair was likely to cause him.
He did not deceive himself as to the
result of this abjuration. He had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span>
immediate presentiment of Mr. Smithson’s
anger, and the difficult, nay,
intolerable position he would be in
if this conversion took place. No
matter, he would brave everything
rather than neglect his duty as a
Christian, which obliged him to
point out the true religion to all who
sought it.</p>

<p>He was also preoccupied at this
time by the remembrance of what
had taken place at Vinceneau’s, and
suffered from the coolness Eugénie
manifested towards him. He saw
he was kept more at a distance than
ever by Mr. Smithson, who looked
upon him as a dangerous man.
Louis’ situation, it must be confessed,
was distressing. He would have
given much to have at least one consoling
word from the lips of her
whom he loved, and before whom he
saw he had been calumniated. This
unhoped-for happiness was at last
granted him under peculiar circumstances.
Louis had just been to
see the Vinceneau family, which was
in a worse plight than ever. The
father had taken to drink with fresh
madness, and the mother had a fit
of indolence that kept her away from
the mill. Madeleine alone worked
for the whole family. Louis had
been there to reason with the mother,
who gave him the worst possible reception.
He tried to encourage the
daughter, but without success. Madeleine
had also, to some degree, the
family weakness&mdash;a lack of energy
of character.</p>

<p>Louis had come away unusually
dejected. On his way back to the
manufactory, while dwelling, first on
these unfortunate people, then on
Adams, who that very day had spoken
of soon abjuring his religion,
and finally on Victor, about whom
he had just received the most alarming
intelligence, he met Eugénie face
to face. She turned pale at seeing
him, and replied to his greeting with
extreme coldness as she kept on....</p>

<p>Louis’ sadness redoubled. He
took a sudden resolution. “I must
justify myself,” he said, ... and,
intimidated as he was&mdash;the man
who loves with a pure affection is
always timid&mdash;he stopped and turned
back.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” said he, addressing
Eugénie, “I have a favor to
ask.”</p>

<p>“What is it, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Among the poor families I am
interested in is one I have never
spoken to you about.”</p>

<p>“You are under no obligation,
monsieur, to inform me of all the
families you visit.”</p>

<p>“I know it, mademoiselle; but, as
I am not ashamed of any of the
places I go to, I have no interest in
concealing them. If I have not
heretofore spoken of this family, it
was for a special reason. These
people, of the name of Vinceneau,
were recommended to me by old
Françoise. She took the liveliest
interest in one of the members of
the household&mdash;a girl by the name
of Madeleine. She feared lest poverty
and her parents’ bad example
might be a source of danger to
one of her age. Madeleine is irreproachable
in her conduct, but weak
in character, like her father and
mother. Françoise made me promise
to watch over her. She would
have begged this favor of you, mademoiselle,
had not a special reason
prevented her. She knew Madeleine’s
parents were envious, and
regarded the rich with an evil eye.
She feared exposing you to impertinence
if she brought you in contact
with them. Consequently, she recommended
them to me. Madeleine
has told me of your call at
the house. Your kindness touched
the mother. As to the father, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span>
shameful passion for drink has brutalized
him.”</p>

<p>Eugénie listened with undisguised
interest, and softened as Louis
continued. When he had finished,
she said: “What do you wish me
to do? to show some interest in
them?”</p>

<p>“It would be a very timely act
of charity. The mother has not
done any work for several days, the
father is gone from morning till
night, and the daughter is discouraged.
You can rouse her courage
much better than I. And allow me
to say, mademoiselle, that the difficulties
that once might have hindered
you being removed, this work, for
many reasons, is much more suitable
for you than for me.”</p>

<p>“I will go to see them.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, mademoiselle,” replied
Louis. “I am overwhelmed
with cares and occupations, and give
the family up to you with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Do you not mean to visit them
any more?”</p>

<p>“I have a great mind not to.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It is a delicate subject, but I
think the less I go there, the better.”</p>

<p>“I understand you, ... but still
I do not think you are right. <i>Fais ce
que dois, advienne que pourra</i>,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> is my
motto. Is it not yours?”</p>

<p>“It would be, mademoiselle, if
the world were not so malicious.
As it is, people even of the best intentions
cannot take too many precautions.
I confess there is nothing
I dread more than calumny. It always
does injury, and it is hard to
feel we are losing the esteem of those
whose good opinion we desire the
most.”</p>

<p>“People who allow themselves to
be influenced by calumny cannot
have much character.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it. Before doubting
a person I have once esteemed,
I wait till their acts openly condemn
them. If I have the misfortune to
despise them then, it is because they
force me to do so.”</p>

<p>These words were uttered in a
significant tone. Eugénie then left
Louis abruptly with a gracious and
dignified salutation.</p>

<p>Louis stood looking at her as she
went away, admiring her slender
form and the exquisite distinction
of her whole person. This sudden
meeting with her seemed like one of
those glimpses of the sun that sometimes
occur in the midst of the most
violent storms. He thanked God;
he felt happy at her indirect assurance
that she still regarded him with
esteem. He asked himself if she did
not love him. He did not dare believe
it, but was almost ready to do
so. One fear alone remained in all
its strength&mdash;the fear of incurring
Mr. Smithson’s anger by co-operating
in the conversion of Adams.</p>

<p>Ah! if Louis had not been heartily
devoted to his faith, how soon he
would have despatched this troublesome
neophyte! But, no; he ought
not, he could not. He consoled
himself by repeating Eugénie’s words,
which had struck him in a peculiar
manner: <i>Fais ce que dois, advienne
que pourra</i>.... “Well,” thought he,
“what I ought to do is to enlighten
those who seek the truth.... I yield
to a sense of duty. Eugénie is a
Catholic as well as I, and cannot
help approving of my course. If
Mr. Smithson is displeased, his
daughter, to be consistent with her
principles, must confess that I am
right.”</p>

<p>As Louis entered his room, a note
was given him from me, imploring him
to come to us as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="pc1">VICTOR’S DEATH.&mdash;PLOTS AGAINST LOUIS.</p>

<p class="p1">For ten long months, Victor had
suffered from a terrible malady that
never lets go. Every remedy had
been tried in vain. His disease was
phthisis of a peculiar kind and of
the most alarming character. The
two physicians we consulted could
only reply when their patient insisted
on knowing the truth: “Your illness
is of an extremely serious nature;
but you are young, and at your
age nature often finds unexpected resources
in a time of danger.”</p>

<p>It was impossible to cure him.
They could only prolong his life, and
this was the aim of the physicians.
By dint of care, they succeeded in
keeping him alive till the beginning
of September. Then the disease,
whose ravages we had not realized,
suddenly came to a crisis. Throughout
the whole course of his sufferings,
I had, in spite of everything,
cherished a secret hope in the depths
of my heart. When one of those
favorable turns came peculiar to
such complaints, I flattered myself
that he would get well, and abandoned
myself to a foolish joy. This
joy, so natural, and yet so unreasonable,
gave Victor pain. He endeavored
to moderate it in a thousand ingenious
and delicate ways. He himself
was never under any illusion. His
illness was fatal: he knew it, and
calmly prepared himself for what he
called the great journey. He was
greatly afflicted to see I was not, like
himself, preparing for our separation,
the thought of which became more
painful in proportion to the horror
with which I regarded it. He tried
to banish all my false hopes, but his
efforts were in vain. I clung to them
without owning it. I only gave them
up at the time I have arrived at in
my sad story. Then I began to realize
the frightful truth, and, as I saw
his alarming symptoms increase, I
thought I should die.</p>

<p>Victor at length succeeded in restoring
somewhat of calmness to my
soul. With a strength of mind that
increased in proportion to the nearness
of that awful moment, he made
his final preparations. He gave
himself up to the contemplation of
eternal things. His friend, the good
Abbé Merlin, administered the last
consolations of religion. Louis received
them with a faith that edified
every one, and a joy that showed
how he had profited by his illness to
prepare for heaven. He was already
there in spirit, and longed to
be there in reality. This touched
me, and I confess, to my great shame,
I reproached him in my excessive
grief with some expressions of bitterness.
This was the last sorrow I
caused my poor husband. Such
reproaches could only come from a
selfish soul. I now blush at the remembrance.</p>

<p>All these necessary steps having
been taken, Victor told me I must
send for Louis. As you know, he
received my note in the evening.
That very night he arrived. It was
high time. We all three passed the
night together talking, praying, and
weeping by turns. Victor consoled
us. He even forced himself to express
anxiety as to Louis’ affairs.
The latter spoke of them very unwillingly,
for his grief overpowered
his sense of love. When Victor
learned the trials he was undergoing,
he said:</p>

<p>“My friend, I fear they are contriving
some new plot against you.
Eugénie loves you; there is no
doubt of that in my mind; but does
she love you well enough to withstand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
all the difficulties that are
rising up around you? I know not.
If, with her knowledge of you, she
allows herself to be influenced by
people of evil intentions, it seems to
me you will have a right to judge
her severely.”</p>

<p>“Even then I could not,” said
Louis.</p>

<p>“Your answer does not surprise
me. It proves I was right in my
impressions. You love her as much
as a good man ought to love. You
even love her too well; for I believe
your affection would render you insensible
to the truth rather than
blame the object of your love.”</p>

<p>“That is true.”</p>

<p>“I cannot approve of that. It is
not right. There is only one thing,
there is only one Being, a noble and
well-balanced soul, a soul thoroughly
imbued with piety, allows itself to
love above all things&mdash;that thing is
truth, that Being is God. Believe
me, if Eugénie allows herself to be
alienated from you, it will be a proof
she has not the worth you give her
credit for, and also that it is not the
will of God she should become your
wife. Well, I will not oppose the
indulgence you feel towards her. I
consent to it. Say to yourself she has
been deceived, that she is innocent,
but submit to the divine will. Do
not attempt impossibilities to link together
the chain God himself breaks,
however dear she may be to you.”</p>

<p>Victor seemed to have recalled all
the energy of his manly nature to utter
these words. His firmness and judicious
counsel were not lost on Louis.</p>

<p>“I will follow your advice,” said
he; “but promise to pray this sorrow
may be spared me. God has endowed
the one I love with a soul so
elevated that it would be easy to
make her as pious as an angel....
And I love her so much!”</p>

<p>“My poor friend! I do not know
that I shall be permitted to pray at
once for you in yonder world. If I
can, I will pray God you may be
united with her, if this union will
render you happy&mdash;happy, understand
me, in the Christian sense of
the word; that is to say, happy and
better, both of you.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, Victor
requested me to go into the next
chamber for some papers he wanted.
He availed himself of this opportunity
to recommend me to Louis’ care,
as I afterwards learned.</p>

<p>“Agnes,” said he, “has exhausted
her strength in taking care of me so
many months. Her physical and
mental strength are now merely factitious.
It is the very excess of her
grief that sustains her. As soon as I
am gone, she will be sensible of her
weakness. I fear the reaction may
prove fatal to her. I implore you to
take her and her mother to some
place near you in the country. Find
them a temporary residence that is
healthy and pleasant. Change of
scene and pure country air will do
her more good than anything else,
especially if you add the benefit of
your efforts to console her, on which
I depend.”</p>

<p>Louis made the required promise....
But these recollections are still
too painful. Alas! they will always
be so. You will excuse me from
dwelling on them.</p>

<p>The next day, I lost the companion
of my life. That pure soul, so
full of intelligence, sweetness, and
energy, took flight for heaven, leaving
me for ever sad and desolate upon
earth.... Oh! how happy are
those women who to the very hour
of death are permitted by God to
retain the companionship of a husband
tenderly loved, and worthy of
being so!...</p>

<p>The first moments of overpowering
grief had scarcely passed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span>
that which Victor had foreseen took
place. All at once I lost my apparent
strength. I was weighed down
with a dull despair. My poor mother
trembled for my life. Throughout
the day I sat motionless in an
arm-chair, interested in no person or
subject. My lips alone made an
effort from time to time to murmur
the words at once so bitter and so
sweet: “O Lord! thou gavest him to
me; thou hast taken him away; thy
will be done!” That was my only
prayer. I repeated it from morning
till night. Thus lifting my soul heavenward,
I found strength to resist
the temptation to rebel which constantly
assailed me.</p>

<p>During that sad time, Louis’ sister
joined him in unceasing attentions
to me. Louis gave himself entirely
up to my service, and notified Mr.
Smithson he should be absent several
days longer from the manufactory.
You can realize how generous this
was in him. To absent himself at
a time his dearest interests were at
stake, and leave the field clear for
his enemies, was making an heroic
sacrifice to friendship. It was not
till a subsequent period I fully appreciated
it. At that time, I was
wholly absorbed in myself. Extreme
grief becomes a kind of passion,
and, like all passions, it renders
us selfish.</p>

<p>When Louis at last saw me a
little calmer, he told me of Victor’s
wish. “His last request was,” said
he, “that you should go into the
country awhile with your mother.
The air is purer there, and you will
regain your strength.”</p>

<p>I exclaimed against the proposition.
I declared I would not leave
the house in which Victor died&mdash;where
everything recalled his presence.
Louis insisted, urged on by
the physicians, who declared the
change indispensable.</p>

<p>“Victor himself implores you
through me to consent,” said he.
“Remember you will be still obeying
him in so doing.”</p>

<p>I ended by yielding to their persuasions.
“But where shall I go?”
said I.</p>

<p>“To St. M&mdash;&mdash;, where you will be
near me. My sister went there yesterday,
and found you pleasant lodgings.
You can easily go that far
with your mother and sister.”</p>

<p>We went there the next day. It
was Louis who made all the arrangements,
and with how much solicitude
and affection I need not
say. At length he left us to resume
his duties at the mill. The last
favor I begged of him was to come
and see me often, but not to mention
to any one the place of my retirement.
Like all who are in real
affliction, solitude alone pleased me.
The first time for a week, Louis’
thoughts, after leaving me, recurred
to the subjects that had absorbed
his mind previous to Victor’s death.
He began to be alarmed. He wondered
if Eugénie had not forgotten
him, if she really loved him, if Mr.
Smithson was disposed to regard him
with more or with less favor, and if
Albert had not profited by his absence
to injure him in the estimation of Eugénie’s
family. But he could only
form conjectures as to all this.</p>

<p>Now that these events have passed
away, I can seize all the details at a
glance. I shall therefore tell you
many things Louis was necessarily
ignorant of when he returned to the
manufactory. He would have trembled
had he been aware of them.
He had scarcely left his post in
order to be with Victor during his
last moments, when his enemies,
thinking the time propitious, resolved
to profit by his absence to effect
his ruin. They all set to work at
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span></p>

<p>The deceitful Adams, who had
sought to be enlightened as to his
religious doubts, went around telling
everybody the engineer had convinced
him of the falseness of his religion,
which he resolved to abjure,
and only waited for Louis’ return.
People began by laughing at what
he said. They had no great opinion
of the fellow. They suspected his
connection with Durand, who was
regarded with fear. Some even
thought it was all a trick. But
Adams returned to the charge; he
spoke with an air of conviction, he
seemed changed. To carry out the
scheme, he apparently broke off with
his former friend, Durand.</p>

<p>All these things were repeated from
one to another till they reached
Mr. Smithson’s ears. He had been
obliged to superintend the workmen
during Louis’ absence from the
manufactory. Already inclined to
be suspicious of the engineer, and
ignorant of the ties that bound him
to Victor, Mr. Smithson interiorly
accused him of first manifesting an
ultra, I may say, fanatical zeal, and
then falling into an indifference and
carelessness unworthy of a consistent
man. “Because one of his
friends is ill,” he said, “is that a sufficient
reason for abandoning his
post, leaving me overwhelmed with
work, and interrupting the school he
had begun?... And all this without
making any arrangement beforehand!...
The man is inconsistent!”</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson was therefore unfavorably
disposed towards Louis,
when, to complete his dissatisfaction,
came the news, at first doubtful,
then certain, of Adams’ intended abjuration.
He became so angry that
he could not contain himself, though
generally so capable of self-control.
The interests of his national religion
were at stake. He at once became
furious, and made no effort to conceal
it.</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson and Albert of
course took Mr. Smithson’s part
against Louis. He was berated as
a man of no discretion, deceitful,
fanatical, and a Jesuit in disguise.
Mme. Smithson was one of those
people who boldly say: “I don’t
think much of a person who changes
his religion!” As if it were not merely
reasonable for a man to give up
error for truth when the truth is revealed
to him. Albert was influenced
by motives you are already
aware of. He was triumphant. He
had never expected such success
from so simple a trick. Circumstances
had indeed favored him but too
well. Seeing Mr. Smithson in such a
frame of mind, he had no doubts of
his dismissing Louis as soon as he returned.</p>

<p>But his joy was strangely diminished
by an unexpected incident.
They were discussing the affair one
evening in the <i>salon</i>. “Excuse me,
father,” said Eugénie, “for meddling
with what does not concern me, but
you know I always was the advocate
of a bad cause.”</p>

<p>Every one looked up at this unexpected
interruption. Eugénie was not
a woman to be intimidated when she
foresaw opposition: rather, the contrary.
She continued, without being
troubled in the least: “I find a
great many are disposed to attack
M. Louis, but no one thinks of defending
him. It were to be wished
some one would be his defender,
though I do not say his conduct is
irreproachable.”</p>

<p>“Very far from that,” said Mr.
Smithson.</p>

<p>“But if he is not innocent, is he
as culpable as he may have appeared?
What is he accused of? He
has been absent several days from
the mill. This adds greatly to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
labors, my dear father, but his absence
is justifiable to a certain degree.
Do you know M. Louis’ history?”</p>

<p>“As well as you, I suppose,
child.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p>“Has he related it to you?”</p>

<p>“No; Fanny took pains to do
that. Fanny is at once curious and
a gossip.”</p>

<p>“My cousin is very severe towards
so devoted a servant. Is she indulgent
only to the culpable?”</p>

<p>This ill-timed interruption gave Eugénie
a glimpse of light. “There is
an understanding between them,”
she said to herself, “and that explains
many things.” She continued,
addressing her father: “M. Louis
made an attempt at his own life. He
was drowning, when a brave man
and an invalid&mdash;M. Barnier&mdash;at the
risk of his own life, threw himself
into the river, and saved him. This
was the origin of their friendship,
which does honor to M. Louis and
to the person so devoted to him.
This M. Barnier is dying to-day.”</p>

<p>“Who told you so, my child?”
asked Mr. Smithson.</p>

<p>“The newspapers from town allude
to it. M. Barnier is a well-known
man, and esteemed by his very
enemies themselves. It is to be
with him M. Louis is gone. Does
not such a motive justify his absence?”</p>

<p>Mr. Smithson had attentively listened
to what his daughter said. If
we except what related to religious
subjects, he was an impartial and
even kindly disposed man. “With
such a reason for his absence,” he
replied, “I shall cease to regard it as
inexcusable. Nevertheless, he ought
to have made me aware of what had
taken place. He simply said he was
going to stay with a sick friend: that
was not a sufficient explanation.
What I dislike in the man is his dissimulation.”</p>

<p>“I acknowledge there may be
some reason for distrust,” resumed
Eugénie, “but he has given no
proofs of duplicity since he came
here that I am aware of. He certainly
has done nothing without consulting
you, father.”</p>

<p>“He did, to be sure, propose
several things he wished to do; but
did he reveal his real aim, his ultimate
object?”</p>

<p>“Had he any?”</p>

<p>“Had he any?... The
Adams affair proves it. The evening-school
and the library were only
founded to propagate Catholicism.”</p>

<p>“With what object?”</p>

<p>“The aim of these enthusiasts is
always the same. They wish to impart
their belief to others, that they
may afterwards exercise authority
over their disciples. Louis and the
<i>curé</i> are linked together. Their project
is to make my manufactory like
a convent, where they can reign in
spite of me. But I will settle that
matter.”</p>

<p>“And you will do right, uncle,”
said Albert. “There is no tyranny
more artful and more encroaching
than that of the priesthood.”</p>

<p>“I did not know my cousin detested
the clergy to such a degree,”
said Eugénie, with an air of mockery
and disdain which convinced Albert
he had made a fresh blunder. “I
thought, on the contrary, you had a
sincere respect for priests. It seems
I was deceived....”</p>

<p>“Enough on this point,” said Mr.
Smithson. “I will see Adams, and
learn from him what has occurred.
And I will speak to the engineer
accordingly when he returns.”</p>

<p>This conversation took place in
the evening. Mme. Smithson was
present. She did not speak, but
was extremely irritated. Eugénie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>
little thought she had caused her
mother as great an affliction as she
had ever experienced in her life. For
ten, perhaps fifteen, years, Mme.
Smithson had clung to the idea of a
match between her daughter and
nephew. She had taken comfort in
the thought of uniting the two beings
she loved best on earth. Besides, it
was a good way, and the only one
in her power, of securing to Albert
a fortune he had need of; for the
career he had embraced, and the
tastes he had imbibed, made it necessary
he should be wealthy, which
was by no means the case. This
plan till lately had been confined to
Mme. Smithson’s own breast; but,
since Albert’s arrival, she had ventured
to allude to it in her conversations
with him. The latter responded
with enthusiastic gratitude, expressing
an ardent desire to have
the proposed union realized. Alas!
from the beginning there had been
one difficulty which fretted Mme.
Smithson. Would her husband approve
of her scheme? As Albert
approached manhood, this consent
became more and more doubtful.
Mr. Smithson treated his nephew
kindly, but had no great opinion of
him, and did not like him. How
overcome this obstacle? There was
only one way: Eugénie herself must
desire the marriage. Mr. Smithson
never opposed his daughter, and
would then overlook his antipathy
to the object of her choice. Things
were having a very different tendency.
Mme. Smithson had long tried
to hide the fact from herself, but she
must at last acknowledge it: Eugénie
manifested no partiality for her
cousin. This evening’s occurrence
banished all illusion. She not only
saw Eugénie had not the least
thought of marrying Albert, but she
suspected her of loving another, ...
a man Mme. Smithson could no
longer endure. He had in her eyes
three faults, any one of which would
have set her against him: he was
her dear nephew’s rival, he had no
property, and he was grave and
pious to a degree that could not fail
to be repulsive to a trivial woman
and a half-way Christian like her.
To complete her despair, Albert
came secretly to see her that very
same evening.</p>

<p>“Aunt,” said he, “our affairs are
getting on badly!... Confess
that I had more penetration than
you were willing to allow.”</p>

<p>“What! what! what do you mean?
Do you think Eugénie loves that
spendthrift, that bigot?...
Nonsense! she only wishes to tease
you.”</p>

<p>“I am of a different opinion. I
have long been aware of her fancy
for him. What she said in his favor
this evening was very judicious and
moderate, but there was in the tone
of her voice, ... in her look, a
something I could not mistake. For
the first time, she betrayed her feelings.
I tell you she loves him!”</p>

<p>“Why, that would be dreadful!”</p>

<p>“I foresaw it.”</p>

<p>“Foresaw!&mdash;such a thing?”</p>

<p>“Eugénie is romantic, and the rogue
puts on the air of a hero of romance.”</p>

<p>“Set your heart at rest, Albert.
I promise to watch over your interests.
I assure you, in case of need,
I will bring your uncle himself to
your aid.”</p>

<p>“I will talk to Eugénie to-morrow
morning,” she said to herself. “I
shall never believe in such presumption
till she confesses it herself.”</p>

<p>The next morning, Mme. Smithson
went, full of anxiety, to her daughter’s
chamber. Eugénie was that very
moment thinking of Louis. The
more she examined her own heart,
the more clearly she saw herself
forced to acknowledge her esteem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
for him. She had inwardly condemned
him many times, but had
as often found her suspicions were
groundless. Without showing the
least partiality for Louis, she could
not help seeing he was intelligent,
energetic, and sincerely pious. She
even acknowledged that, of all the
men she had ever met, not one was
to be compared to him; he was
superior to them all in every respect.
From this, it was not a long step to
confess him worthy of her affection.
But he&mdash;did he love her?...
Not a word, not a sign, had escaped
him to indicate such a thing, and
yet there was in his bearing towards
her, in the tone of his voice, and in
the value he attached to her good
opinion, a something that assured
her she had made a profound impression
on him. But, then, why this
coldness so rigorously maintained?...
He was poor&mdash;and through
his own fault&mdash;while she was rich.
His coldness perhaps resulted from
extreme delicacy.</p>

<p>Eugénie cut short her reflections
by repeating: “Does he love me?...
It may be. Do I love him?...
I dare not say no. But we
are in a peculiar position. If I find
him, at the end of the account,
worthy of being my husband, doubtless
I should have to make the
advances! But I like originality in
everything. My father alone excites
my fears. M. Louis would not be
his choice. Why does he show himself
so zealous a Catholic at present?
Why not wait till he is married&mdash;if
married we ever are? Then he could
be as devoted to the church as he
pleases.”</p>

<p>Mme. Smithson was hardly to be
recognized when she entered her
daughter’s room. She was generally
affable and smiling, but now her face
was lowering and agitated. She
was evidently very nervous, as was
usually the case when she had some
disagreeable communication to make
to her daughter. Eugénie at once
divined what was passing in her
mother’s heart. She was careful,
however, not to aid her in unburdening
herself.</p>

<p>After speaking of several things of
no importance, Mme. Smithson assumed
an unconcerned air&mdash;a sign
of her extreme embarrassment&mdash;and
broached the subject with a boldness
peculiar to timid people when they
see there is no way of receding.</p>

<p>“I must confess that was a strange
notion of yours last evening.”</p>

<p>“What notion do you refer to,
mother?” said Eugénie, in a tone at
once dignified and ingenuous. She
felt the storm was coming. As usual
on such occasions, she laid aside the
familiar <i>thou</i> for the respectful <i>you</i>.
There was a spice of mischief in
her tactics which I do not intend to
applaud. She thus redoubled her
mother’s embarrassment, and by the
politeness of her manner increased
her hesitation.</p>

<p>“What notion do I refer to?...
You need not ask that. You know
well enough what I allude to....
Yes; why should you, without any
obligation, set yourself up to defend
a man who is no relation of ours or
even one of our friends, but a mere
employé of your father’s; one who
suits him certainly, but who is likely to
cause trouble in the house; ... who
is, in short, a dangerous man?...”</p>

<p>“You astonish me to the last degree,
mother! I never, no, never
should have suspected M. Louis of
dangerous designs, or that he even
had the power to disturb us.”</p>

<p>“Raillery, my dear, is in this case
quite out of place. What secret motive
have you for undertaking his
defence?”</p>

<p>“I? I have none. What motive
could I have?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then, why take sides against
us?”</p>

<p>“Why, I have not taken sides
against you!”</p>

<p>“How can you deny it?”</p>

<p>“I do deny it, mother, with your
permission. My father imputed intentions
to M. Louis which perhaps
he never had. I merely observed
it would be more just to
wait for proofs before condemning
him. That is all, and a very small
affair.”</p>

<p>“Wait for proofs before condemning
him, do you say?... Well,
he has them. Adams has confessed
everything.... He acknowledges
that M. Louis endeavored to convert
him, lent him books, taught him
the catechism, and, what was worse,
dwelt a great deal on hell as a place
he could not fail to go to if he,
Adams, remained a Protestant. The
poor fellow has not recovered from
his terror yet!... Your father has
talked to him very kindly, given him
good advice, mingled with kind reproaches.
Adams was affected, and
ended by saying he never wished to
see M. Louis again; and he did a
lucky thing!”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that Adams is
either a simpleton or a hypocrite.”</p>

<p>“Eugénie, that is altogether too
much!”</p>

<p>“I do not see anything very
astonishing in what I have said.
Please listen to me a moment, mother.
To hesitate between two creeds,
without being able to decide on
either, seems to me a proof of weakness.
But if, on the contrary, Adams
invented this story of his conversion
in order to yield at a favorable moment
and gain the good-will of my
father more than ever, would not
this show a duplicity and artfulness
that could only belong to a hypocrite?...”</p>

<p>“Adams could not have invented
such a thing. It would have rendered
him liable to dismissal.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, mother.
Adams did not risk anything. The
course he has taken proves it. And
that is precisely what makes me distrust
him.”</p>

<p>“How can you impute such motives
to anybody!... Adams has
renounced his intention, because he
was convinced by your father’s arguments.
He has behaved like an
honest man!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, mother; we are in
more danger than ever of not understanding
each other. Why! you
seem to rejoice that Adams has returned
to his errors! You appear to
think his course very natural, and to
approve of it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do approve of it; people
ought not to change their religion.”</p>

<p>“You might as well say a person
ought not to acknowledge his error
when he is mistaken. I am by no
means of your opinion, though I am
not very religious.”</p>

<p>“<i>A propos</i> of religion, my dear,
you seem to have taken a strange
turn. You have grown so rigorous
as to astonish me; there is not an
ultra notion you do not approve of.
You have completely changed since....
But I will not make you
angry.”</p>

<p>“Since M. Louis came here?...
A pretty idea. But I am not surprised.”</p>

<p>“You said it yourself, but it is
true. Since that man came here,
you have changed every way. I
know not why or wherefore, but it is
a fact. Your cousin himself has observed
it, and it grieves him. You
are no longer towards him as you
once were. You keep him at a distance.
You are not lively as you
used to be. You only talk of things
serious enough to put one asleep.”</p>

<p>“It is nearly ten years since I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
brought in such close contact with
my cousin as now. I was very
young then. I have grown older
and more sensible. Why has not he
done the same?”</p>

<p>“Your sarcasm is malicious and
unmerited. Albert is a charming
fellow.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I agree with you! But this
very fact injures him in my estimation.
A charming fellow is one who
requires an hour to dress; is skilled
in paying a multitude of compliments
he does not mean; has a petty mind
that only takes interest in trifles; in
short, a useless being it is impossible
to rely on. When Albert came, he
seemed to be conscious of the absurdity
of being a charming fellow.
He tried to put on a semblance of
gravity, but it did not last long.
Once more the proverb held good:
<i>Chasser le naturel, il revient au galop</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>“Wonderful, my dear. You have
every qualification for a <i>dévote</i>:
especially one characteristic&mdash;maliciousness.
Poor Albert! how you
have set him off! Happily, there is
not a word of truth in all you have
said. He a man on whom you cannot
rely! He has a heart of gold.”</p>

<p>“I do not dispute the goodness
of his heart. I have never put it to
the proof.”</p>

<p>“What a wicked insinuation!
How dreadful it is to always believe
the worst of everybody.”</p>

<p>“Well, let it be so: he has a kind
heart!... But is there any
depth to him?”</p>

<p>“As much as is necessary. This
would be a sad world if we were
always obliged to live with moody
people like some one I know of. I
really believe he is your beau ideal.”</p>

<p>“I do not say that; but, if he is
really what he appears to be, he
merits my good opinion. I wish all
I live with resembled him.”</p>

<p>“Well done! A little more, and
you will tell me he is the realization
of all your dreams.”</p>

<p>“I do not know him well enough
to accord him all your words seem
to imply.”</p>

<p>“At all events, you know him
well enough to take an interest in
him, and much more than would
suit your father.... Your cousin
even was scandalized at your daring
to defend him against your father,
who had good reason to blame
him.”</p>

<p>“My cousin would do well to attend
to his own affairs, and not
meddle with mine. If he came here
to watch me, sneer at me, and give
me advice, he had better have remained
in Paris.”</p>

<p>“He came here hoping to find
the friend of his childhood glad to
see him, and ready to show him the
affection he merits. Everybody
does not judge him as severely as
you do. I know many girls who....”</p>

<p>“Who would be glad to marry
him! Well, they may have him!”</p>

<p>“That is too much! The son of
my sister whom I love with all my
heart! A child whom I brought up
and love almost as much as I do
you!”</p>

<p>“But, mother, I am not displeased
because you love him. I do not
dislike him. I wish him well, and
would do him all the good in my
power. But when I make choice of
a husband, I shall choose one with
qualities Albert will never possess.”</p>

<p>“I have suspected it for a long
time. Yes; I thought long ago,
seeing the turn your mind was taking,
that, when you married, it would
be foolishly.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by foolishly?”</p>

<p>“Marrying a man without property,
or one with eccentric notions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span>
or some prosy creature of more or
less sincerity. I am very much
afraid you are infatuated about an
individual who has all these defects
combined. Fortunately.... You
understand me....”</p>

<p>“What, mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes; we shall watch over your
interests, your father and I, and if
you are disposed to make a foolish
match, like one that occurs to me,
we shall know how to prevent it.
We shall not hesitate if obliged to
render you happy in spite of yourself.”</p>

<p>“Render me happy?... At all
events, it would not be by forcing
me to marry Albert.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, you shall marry no
one else.... It is I who say so,
and your father will show you he is
of my opinion.”</p>

<p>Upon this, Mme. Smithson went
out, violently shutting the door after
her. Like all people of weak character,
she must either yield or fall
into a rage. It was beyond her
ability to discuss or oppose anything
calmly.</p>

<p>It was all over! All her plans
were overthrown! She must bid
farewell to her dearest hopes! She
must no longer think of retaining
Albert and sending for his mother&mdash;for
Mme. Smithson’s desires went
as far as that! Her dream was to
unite the two families by marrying
Eugénie and Albert. Instead of
that, what a perspective opened before
her!&mdash;a marriage between her
daughter and Louis, which roused
all her antipathies at once! She
was beside herself at the bare
thought of seeing herself connected
with a son-in-law she could not endure,
and who was no less repulsive
to Mr. Smithson.... Her maternal
heart was kind when no one contradicted
her, but there was in its
depths, as often happens in weak natures,
a dash of spitefulness. Having
returned to her chamber, Mme.
Smithson began to reflect. She seldom
gave herself up to reflection,
and then only when she was troubled,
as is the case with some people.
As might be supposed, she was too
excited to reflect advantageously.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” she said to herself,
“Eugénie dares resist me the only
time I ever asked her to obey! She
despises Albert. She speaks scornfully
of him! And that is not sufficient:
she carries her audacity so
far as to sing the praises of a man I
detest!... See what it is to
be indulgent to one’s children! The
day comes when, for a mere caprice,
they tread under foot what was
dearest to you.... Well, since
she will do nothing for me, I will
do nothing for her.... She
rejects Albert. I will have the other
one driven away.... Since
that meddler came, everything has
gone wrong here.... What a
nuisance that man is! If he had
not come here, everything would
have gone on as I wished....
I will go in search of my husband.
It will be easy to have the engineer
sent off, after committing so many
blunders. When he is gone, we
shall have to endure my daughter’s
ill-humor, but everything comes to
an end in this world. The time will
come when, realizing her folly, Eugénie
will listen to reason.”</p>

<p>The interview between Mr. Smithson
and his wife took place a little
while after. What was said I never
knew. Mme. Smithson alluded to it
once or twice at a later day, but
merely acknowledged she did very
wrong. The remembrance was evidently
painful, and she said no
more.</p>

<p>Eugénie at once foresaw this private
interview between her parents.
The conversation she had just had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
with her mother only served to enlighten
her more fully as to the state
of her feelings. Forced to express
her opinion of Albert and Louis, she
had spoken from her heart. She
was herself in a measure astonished
at seeing so clearly she did not love
Albert&mdash;that there was a possibility
of loving Louis&mdash;that perhaps she
already loved him.... And
she also comprehended more clearly
all the difficulties such an attachment
would meet with. Her mother’s opposition
had hitherto been doubtful.
It was now certain, and the
consequence was to be feared.</p>

<p>“My mother is so much offended,”
she said to herself, “that she will try
to unburden her mind to my father
at once, and perhaps influence him
against me. Before the day is over,
she will tell him all I said, and the
thousand inferences she has drawn
from it. This interview fills me with
alarm! I wish I knew what they
will decide upon, if they come to
any decision....”</p>

<p>Eugénie tried in vain to get some
light on the point, but was not able
to obtain much. The interview took
place. Mr. Smithson seemed vexed
and thoughtful after his wife left the
office. Mme. Smithson went directly
to give the porter orders to send the
engineer to her husband as soon as
he arrived. Louis had sent word the
evening before he should return the
following day.</p>

<p class="pc1">DISCOURSE PRONOUNCED JANUARY 13, 1873, TO INAUGURATE THE LECTURES INTENDED
FOR THE WORKING-CLASSES.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">To-day</span> we inaugurate the lectures
specially consecrated to workingmen.
We are full of joyous hopes,
and believe that this work of
light will be at the same time a
work of reconciliation, of love, and
of peace. The cross, which we
have placed conspicuously in all our
places of reunion&mdash;the cross, that
we elevate and display everywhere
as a magnificent standard&mdash;the cross,
that we will never consent to hide,
indicates clearly what is our faith
and what is our aim. We wish to
enlighten your understandings, dilate
your hearts, direct your wills in
the way of the good, the beautiful,
and the true. In a word, we wish
to conquer you for Christ, and we
say it here with a frankness which
profoundly abhors all cunning of
speech. You will give us credit for
sincerity, which you have always
loved; for, as has been said by a
great contemporary orator,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> “The
people are not deceived; they feel
when they are approached with
faith in them and in their eminent
dignity.”</p>

<p>We come, then, to you with this
cross of Constantine, which has
converted the world. This glorious
sign we have surrounded with rays,
to show you that light proceeds
from Christianity, as the stream
flows from its source, and the beams
radiate from a star. If possible, we
would have adopted as a flag the
beautiful cross in the catacomb of
S. Pontian, from which spring roses&mdash;symbols
of joy. We would have
chosen it, to show you that in Christ
is found not only the repose of the
enlightened understanding, but also
the repose, the joy, and the alleluia
of the satisfied heart. It is by this
sign we will conquer.</p>

<p>In this first lecture, which will
serve as an humble preface to the discourses
of so many eminent orators,
we intend only to take up the working
question, to tell you our entire
thought on the subject, to open to
you our whole heart. Do not hope
to hear an academic speech; do not
expect those vain compliments to
which you have been accustomed
from flatterers who did not love
you. We say at first and without
circumlocution that between Christian
society and the working world
there exists to-day a certain misunderstanding,
and it is this misunderstanding
we would wish to dissipate,
and we beg of the divine
Workman of Nazareth to direct our
words, blessed by him, to the understanding
and heart of the workmen
of Paris.</p>

<p>In the first part of this discourse,
which will be brief, we will say what
we are; in the second, what we
wish; and in the third, we will reply
to certain objections to the church
which are current among workingmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[752]</a></span>
and cause the deplorable misunderstanding
from which we wish
to deliver your minds and hearts,
equally oppressed. It is time that
the truth should free you.</p>

<p class="pc1">I.</p>

<p class="p1">In order that you may better understand
what we are, we wish to
commence by showing you what we
are not.</p>

<p>We are not politicians; this we
desire to declare openly. Never,
never will there be pronounced in
this precinct one word that may
even remotely touch upon our old
or recent discords. We will never
deserve to be called partisans.
Whatever may be our intimate convictions
(and we have the right to
have them), we only wish to be and
we will only be Christians. We
suppose there may be in the bosom
of all the avowed parties sincere
Catholics who are by no means
<i>independents</i>. When we tread upon
the threshold of her basilicas, the
church, which rises before us, does
not ask if we are monarchists or
republicans, but only if we believe
in the eternal Word, who created
heaven and earth, who became man
in the crib of Bethlehem, and who
saved us on a cross. Thus will we
do, and the only popular song you
will hear in this place will be the
Credo; come, come, and sing it
with us.</p>

<p>Thank God, we do not belong to
the group, too numerous, of pretended
conservatives, who only see in the
labor question a painful preoccupation
which might trouble the calm
of their digestion; who do not wish
to impose upon themselves any real
sacrifice, and are easily astonished
that the working-classes complain of
their sufferings. We are not like
the fashionable and delicate egoists
who for several centuries have given
the fatal example of indifference, of
doubt, and of negation in religion,
who have followed Voltaire, who
have wickedly laughed in the face
of outraged truth, who have torn
God from the heart of the workman,
and who nevertheless persist in affirming
that “religion is good for the
people”&mdash;men of refinement, who
to-day edit journals full of talent,
where on the first page is offered
ultra-conservative articles, and on
the second ultra-obscene romances.
No; we are not of this class. Away
with those sceptics whose fears make
them pretend to have the faith!
Away with those who doubt the
people, and who do not love them!</p>

<p>We are not of those who are led
to you by this vile fear or by a still
viler interest; we are not of those
who see in you an armed force before
which they must tremble, or an
electoral majority before whom they
must kneel. We will never come to
solicit your votes, and we are bent
upon serving you with absolute disinterestedness.
Briefly, we are for
you and will always be your friends
and servants, but will never condescend
to court you. Besides, the
victory which we desire is not that
which can be gained by force, consequently
we do not count on force.
We only wish to win your understandings
with our faith, your hearts
with our love.</p>

<p>We do not place the golden age
in a past too superstitiously loved.
Whatever affection I may feel in my
heart for those dear middle ages, to
which I have consecrated all my
studies and all my life, I do not find
them sufficiently Christian to be the
only ideal. We know that those
centuries, so differently judged, were
the theatre of a gigantic struggle
between paganism, more and more
conquered, and the church, more
and more victorious; and we draw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[753]</a></span>
fundamental distinction between the
chivalry that so heroically defended
the truth and the feudality that did
it such injury. We do not ignore
the fact that paganism, in dying, left
to the Christian ages, as a frightful
legacy, the traditions of slavery,
impurity, and violence; and we confess
that Christianity could not in
one day decapitate the hundred-headed
hydra.</p>

<p>If we regard especially the workmen’s
guilds or corporations, we will
go so far as to own that their organization,
so admirably Christian in
some respects, nevertheless left too
much room for certain abuses that
we hate; and, as a decisive example,
we assert that the material condition
of the members was not then what
a Christian heart would wish to-day.
We have the religion, not the superstition,
of the middle ages; of that
epoch so unworthily calumniated we
preserve all the elements truly Christian,
and reject the others. We recognize
in that rude and laborious
age the dawn, the beautiful dawn,
of Catholic civilization so scandalously
interrupted by the Renaissance.
In those centuries, so slighted and
misunderstood, we salute above all
the cycle of the saints.</p>

<p>We ardently love the sublime period
when S. Benedict gave to a
hundred thousand men and to twenty
generations the order and signal
to clear the minds and the fields,
equally sterile; when S. Francis conversed
with the birds of the air, reconciled
all nature with humanity
Christianized, and gave to his contemporaries
the love of “our lady,
poverty!” We love the period made
joyful by the death of slavery under
the font of the church; when all the
institutions of the state and of the
family were energetically Catholic;
when royalty was represented by a
S. Louis, love by a S. Elizabeth,
science by a S. Thomas of Aquinas.
But our soul has still stronger wings,
and would fly still higher. We wish
still more, we wish still better, and
we will build up the future with two
kinds of materials&mdash;with the past
undoubtedly, but also with our desires,
which are vast.</p>

<p>We are not of those who ingenuously
think the world at present
is organized as one would wish.
Doubtless there are in the working-class
of our time illegitimate desires,
guilty jealousies, unrighteous thirsts;
but we also know all that the world
of laborers can offer to the eyes of
God, of cruel sufferings, of noble
sighs, and of honest tears. God
preserve us from ever laughing at
one of those griefs, even should they
be merited! On the contrary, we
hope that Christian society will one
day come, through peace and prayer,
the sacraments and love, to a better
disposition, a more profound pacification,
a happier distribution of
riches, a wider-spread prosperity, and
to something more resembling the
reign of God. But, alas! we are
convinced that the definitive repartition
and equality will only be consummated
in eternity. Those who
do not believe in a future life will
never see their desire of infinite justice
satisfied&mdash;they condemn themselves
to this punishment.</p>

<p>We do not despise the work of
the hands; far from it, we seek to
place the mechanic close to the artist.
For centuries, there have been
Pyrenees between art and industry;
these Pyrenees we wish to remove,
and we will succeed. In truth, the
workman is an august being; and
the title of his nobility will be easily
found in the depths of faith and of
theology. Listen: the eternal type,
the adorable type, of the workman is
the Heavenly Father, the <i>Faber divinus</i>,
who, not content with making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[754]</a></span>
obedient matter spring from nothing,
like a sublime goldsmith chiselled it
into a splendid jewel. Beauty, Goodness,
personal and living Truth&mdash;such,
to the letter, was the first Workman.
God joined, framed, hewed,
cemented, carved the whole universe,
the firmament, the stars. His gracious
and magnificent hand, armed
with an invisible chisel, is discovered
in every part of the creation which
has been wonderfully sculptured by
this marvellous Workman. Workmen
of every condition, here contemplate
the work of your Model, of your
Master, of your divine Patron. The
sombre forests, the transparent foliage,
the flowers whose wonders are
only revealed by the microscope, the
mountains, the ocean, the infinite
depths&mdash;all, all were made by the
great Workman.</p>

<p>Incomparable Artificer! he conceived
the plan of all these beings in
His eternal Word, and one day, to realize
this design, he pronounced these
words: “Be they!” and they were.
But it was not enough to show himself
the workman; God feared, if I
may be allowed so to speak, that his
calling might be despised; and he desired
so truly to be a workman that
of a God he made himself a carpenter
as well as man. He chose a noble
position, perfectly characteristic, and,
with his divine hands, sawed, planed,
polished, worked the wood that in
the first hour of the world he had worked
in the design of the creation.
Workmen, my brethren, it is not a
fable, it is not a symbol: Jesus, the
Son of God, was the apprentice,
the companion, the workman, the
carpenter; and the venerable monuments
of tradition show him to us
making ploughs, perhaps crosses.
What can I not say to you of the
Holy Ghost, considered as the Workman
of the spiritual world, which
he had really cemented, hewed, and
framed? What can I not explain of
the beautiful realities of symbolism?
With regret I leave this workshop
of the church, and now content myself
with the workshop of the creation,
and with that of Nazareth.</p>

<p>But you question me more earnestly,
and ask what I think of the
contemporary workman. And I reply
that, notwithstanding his faults
and errors, I feel for him a great love,
invincibly aroused by Christ. Yes;
I close my eyes, I abstract myself.
I forget so many ignoble flames, so
much blood, the pure blood so sacrilegiously
shed. I wish to separate
my thoughts from so many ruins,
so many scandals. I come to you,
pagan workman, rebellious to God,
and, in the midst of your rebellious
and Satanic orgies, I approach you,
who formerly were baptized, and
place my hand upon your heart,
that I may not despair. Your mind
is darkened, your will misled; but
there are yet some pulsations which
allow me still to hope, and I willingly
repeat the words of that great
bishop who has devoted so much
time to the social question: “The
people love that which is beautiful,
they understand what is great; know
that they have high aspirations, and
that they seek to rise.” And again:
“The workman of our day has eliminated
the generous ideas from the
Gospel, and yet borrows from Christianity
his noble and holy sentiments.”</p>

<p>Nothing is truer; if chemistry could
analyze souls, what Christian elements
would be found in those of
workmen! I readily see in each the
admirable material of one of those
poor men so powerfully sketched by
Victor Hugo. He speaks of a miserable
fisherman on the sea-shore,
who already has five children, perishing
from hunger; when one day
at market, he sees and adopts two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[755]</a></span>
orphans poorer than he, and thus he
reasons: “We have five children,
these will make seven; we will
mingle them together, and they will
climb at night on our knees. They
will live, and will be brother and sister
to the five others. When God
sees that we must feed this little boy
and this little girl with the others, he
will make us catch more fish, that is
all!” Workmen of Paris, read these
lines; they are worth more than
those of the <i>Année terrible</i>, and paint
you exactly. You are capable of
this sublime devotion, and I recall
you to the true nobility of your nature.</p>

<p>You know now what we are not,
and I think that we have never failed
for an instant to be truly sincere.
On the contrary, we have designedly
multiplied all the difficulties with
perfect frankness. It is scarcely necessary
to add that we are not of
those who disdain the social and
labor questions, and who, while hiding
themselves in the graceful domain of
fancy, repeat with Alfred de Musset:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“If two names by chance mingle in my song,<br />
They will always be Ninette or Ninon.”</p>

<p class="pn1">This charming indifference is but
a form of selfishness. Let us go
further, and although in our quality
of Catholics (the only nobility, the
only title to which we are really attached)
we place a higher estimate
on the future life than the present,
we do not think only of the heavenly
destiny of the workman. For more
than eighteen hundred years, the
church has not ceased for an instant
to occupy herself with the temporal
condition of all the working-classes.
In her firmament, there are fourteen
magnificent constellations, which are
called the seven corporal works of
mercy, and the seven spiritual. She
has made them all shine on the brow
of the workman, and it is for him,
above all, that she preserves the light.
This example of our mother, the
church, we always wish to imitate.
We know, besides, and it is a powerful
argument, that misery is a poor
counsellor, and, if it is badly accepted,
turns souls from duty and eternity.</p>

<p>Therefore, we declare a mortal
war against want and misery, and it
is thus that, in ameliorating the earth,
we hope to prepare heaven.</p>

<p>We wish at this moment our heart
were an open book, written in large
characters, and readable for all.
Our brothers, the workmen, would
see that we do not blindly accuse
them of all the crimes and mistakes
of modern society, and that we very
well know how to comment severely
on the other classes. They would
there read the programme of our
work, as recently sketched by a great
bishop of the holy church: “We
should believe in the people, hope in
them, love them.” For you must
not imagine that alms will here suffice,
and that the people will accept
them; they exact all our heart, our
esteem, our respect. He who does
not respect the workman can do nothing.
Thus, this doctrine of respect
for the workman, the truly Christian
doctrine, is the base upon which the
Catholic Circle of Workingmen has
erected its edifice: may God prosper
and bless it!</p>

<p>Ask us now with frankness what
we are, what is our faith, and listen
well to our reply, which will not be
less sincere.</p>

<p>We believe in one only God, the
supreme and sovereign Workman,
whom we do not confound with his
work; the work is divine, but it is
not God. Beyond the world, above
the world, in an inaccessible region,
lives and reigns from everlasting to
everlasting the majesty of God, the
Infinite and Absolute, the Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[756]</a></span>
and Mercy, the Good, the True, and
the Beautiful, living and personal,
the eternal Providence, who watches
over the workmen of all races and of
all times. There are among you some
who refuse to this God the free adhesion
of their faith, and it is this negation
which we come here to combat
with the arms of reason and of
light. All depends upon your faith;
even though you may be atheists,
we will love you, but, alas! you will
not return our love, and the reconciliation
so ardently desired will not
be easily realized; for you can only
be dissolved in love, and God is love.</p>

<p>We believe, then, in God the Creator,
and we bow before him with
the simple and magnificent faith of
the humble stone-cutter of whom Lamartine
speaks, and who one day
said to our great poet, “I do not
know how other men are made; but,
as for me, I cannot see, I do not
say a star, but even an ant, the leaf
of a tree, a grain of sand, without
asking who made it; and the reply
is, God. I understand it well, for,
before being, it was not; therefore,
it could not make itself.” I quote
these beautiful words with great joy
under the roof of a chapel especially
consecrated to workmen. Meditate
upon them, workmen, who listen to
me; and, if you are republicans,
respect, love, believe in what this
republican of 1848 respected, loved,
and believed. Then the workman
believed in God; this time must
return, and for this necessary work
we will expend our time, our strength,
our life. But it is not enough to believe
in God; we must render to the
Creator the act of the creature, and
offer him respect, homage, confidence,
prayer, and love. Blessed be this
little chapel of <i>Jésus-Ouvrier</i>, if this
night one of these sentiments will be
offered by one of the souls who are
here and listen to me.</p>

<p>We also believe in the Son of God,
the Word, the interior Speech, the
creative Word of the Father, and we
affirm that this Word, at a determined
moment of history, came down
on our earth that sin had stained,
and that had to be purified. To
arrive at God, who is absolute purity,
we must be white or whitened.
Are we white of ourselves? Look
into your souls, and answer. Christ,
then, came to suffer, to expiate, to
die for us all, and especially for all
workmen, past, present, and to come.
Such is the admirable doctrine of the
solidarity of expiation; and it is here
that Jesus is again the type of workmen.
Oh! who can complain of
work, when God for thirty years
submitted to the rigorous law of
manual labor! Who can complain
of suffering, when he bore the weight
of all the sufferings of the body and
of the human soul! Who can complain
of loneliness and abandonment,
when this God was betrayed by his
tenderest friends, and abandoned by
all except his mother, who remained
standing at the foot of the cross!
Who can complain of dying in solitude,
in grief, and in shame, on the
pallet of a garret or the bed of a
hospital, when he, the Creator of so
many millions of suns and of the
universe, gave us the example of the
most cruel death, after having offered
us as model the most wretched life!
Ah! they had reason to decree the
suppression of the crucifix in the
hospitals and schools; for a true
workman cannot look at the crucifix
without being moved to the bottom
of his soul, without extending to it
his arms, without being profoundly
consoled, without crying, “Behold
my Master, my Example, and my
Father!”</p>

<p>We believe that Christianity is
contained in these words, which we
should ponder: “Imitation of Christ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[757]</a></span>”
and, in particular, “Imitation of
Jesus the workman.” It is by that
means we will be led to give a
place to private virtues, which
our adversaries do not wish to
accord to us. Nowadays it is
fashionable among workmen and
others to repeat this ill-sounding
proposition, which is an exact summary
of Victor Hugo’s last work:
that “Society is bad, and man is
good.” Do not believe it; man is
an intelligent, free, responsible being,
who can, when he wishes, and with
the aid of God, conquer the evil in
him, and do good. As society is
only a composition of men, it follows
and will ever be that, if each one
of us becomes purer, more humble,
more charitable, better, society will
itself become less savage, more enlightened,
better organized, every
way improved. In political economy,
we cannot too highly exalt the
<i>rôle</i> of private virtues.</p>

<p>It can be demonstrated mathematically,
and it will soon be shown,
that everything socially springs from
sacrifice. If you wish to know here
what distinguishes the Catholics
from their enemies, I will tell you
very simply that they place duty before
right, and that the enemies of
the church place right before duty.
Certainly, we believe in right as
strongly as you can; but we make it
the logical consequence and, if I
may say so, the reward of accomplished
duty. Weigh well this doctrine,
to which is attached the destiny
of the world.</p>

<p>Finally, we believe in the life everlasting.
Doubtless it is to be desired
that all men should make
every effort for the reign of justice
on this earth; in this, the Catholics
have not been wanting, nor ever will
be. But whatever may be the legitimate
beauty of these attempts, I
think that the perfection of ideal
justice will only be found in the
future life, and that, to make the definitive
balance of the fate of each
man, heaven must always enter in
the calculation. Here below there
are too many inconsolable sorrows,
more suffering than social equality
can ever suppress. Alas! there will
always be the passions that ravage
the heart; always ingratitude and
abandonment; always sickness and
the death of those whom we love
best. Paradise of my God! you will
re-establish the equilibrium; paradise
of my God! if you are, above all, destined
for those who have suffered,
you will be assuredly opened to workmen.
In this hope I live.</p>

<p>And here I am led to recapitulate,
not without emotion, all the benefits
that Providence has more especially
reserved for you. “A heavenly Father,
who merits above all the title
of workman, and who made the
earth; a God, who comes on earth
to take up the plane, the saw, and
the hammer, and become the prototype
of workmen; an infallible church
that for eighteen hundred years has
bent over workmen, to enlighten, console,
and love them; an eternity of
happiness, where all present injustice
will be superabundantly repaired.”</p>

<p>Workmen, my brethren, what can
you ask further? In the place of
God, what could you make better?
Answer.</p>

<p class="pc1">II.</p>

<p class="p1">What do we wish, however? In
other words, what can we promise
you?</p>

<p>First of all, there are twenty promises
we cannot make you, and it is
our duty here to warn you of our
<i>non possumus</i>.</p>

<p>We cannot promise you ever to
consider armed revolt as a duty or
a right. We cling with all the
strength of our understanding to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[758]</a></span>
doctrine that even against injustice
the protest should be martyrdom,
heroically accepted, heroically submitted.
Thus did the first Christians;
they allowed themselves to
be slaughtered like beautiful sheep,
covered with generous blood. This
sublimely passive resistance will not
take from us, as it never did from
them, the liberty of speech; they
died declaring their belief in God,
the supreme Principle, and in the
Son of God, the sovereign Expiator.
And when fifteen or eighteen millions
had been killed, the church
triumphed; she then came forth from
the catacombs, and to her was given
the mission to enlighten the world.</p>

<p>We do not promise you the liberty
of doing evil, and it would be false
if we even appeared to make such
an engagement. At this instant,
there are five hundred men in France
who pervert, corrupt, putrefy France;
among these are four hundred and
ninety writers and ten caricaturists;
according to our idea, it is deplorable
that they can freely exercise their
trade, and destroy with impunity so
many millions of souls among young
girls, young men, and workmen.</p>

<p>We cannot with sincerity promise
you absolute equality on this earth.
What we can promise you hereafter
is that beautiful equality of Christians
who are sprung from the same God-Creator,
saved by the same God-Redeemer,
enlightened by the same
God-Illuminator. It is the equality,
the profound equality, of baptism
and the eucharist; the equality
of souls in trials and reward;
it is, in fine, equality in heaven. As
for the other, we will exhaust ourselves
in the effort to obtain it; but
we have two obstacles before us,
over which we do not hope to triumph&mdash;sickness
and vice. No
equality is possible with these two
scourges, and they are ineradicable.
We cannot promise you either illegitimate
pleasure or even the end
of suffering. In taking suffering
from man&mdash;which is impossible&mdash;they
would take from him his resemblance
to God, and consequently
his true greatness and his titles
to heaven. The more we suffer, the
more we resemble our Father, the
more we merit eternal joy. In suffering
will be found the Christian
principle, which we cannot efface
from the Gospel, and which is even
the essence of the Christian life.
But we promise to suffer with you,
and, as the church has done for
eighteen hundred years, to alleviate
your sorrows, to heal your wounds,
to satisfy your material and moral
hunger, and to quench your thirst
for truth. The fathers of the church
invite us only to consider ourselves
as “depositaries of riches.” All
property is but a deposit in our
hands&mdash;a deposit which we are
strictly obliged to communicate to
you, and for which we must render
an account to the Master.</p>

<p>We promise you also faith, which
gives to the soul a noble attribute
and a happy tranquillity. And with
faith we can give you what has been
well called the <i>intelligence of life</i>&mdash;the
intelligence thanks to which the
workman knows how to accept inequality,
because he sees in the horizon
the beautiful perspective of eternity.
We promise you calmness in
certainty, the consolation that every
workman can feel in regarding his divine
type; and, in giving you this
type, you will possess a rare treasure,
for which your souls are justly eager.</p>

<p>We promise you the sweetness of
work Christianly accepted. Says a
great Christian: “What matters work
when Jesus Christ is there?” It is
here that we must recall those splendid
verses of the greatest of our
poets&mdash;those verses which we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[759]</a></span>
wish to see written on the walls
of all our transfigured workshops:
“God, look you&mdash;let the senseless
reject&mdash;causes to be born of labor two
daughters: Virtue which makes cheerfulness
sweet, and Cheerfulness which
makes virtue charming.” And with
work, you will conquer also the
“courage of life”; for you will be
convinced that all beings are subjected
to this great law, and that the
blows of your hammers are the notes
of a universal chant. “All work,
each one is at his post; he who
governs the state; the savant, who
extends the limits of human explorations;
the sculptor, who makes the
statue spring from his chisel; the
poet, who sings between his tears and
his sighs; the priest, who punishes
and pardons&mdash;all, down to you, poor
workman, in your smoky workshop.
We are all living stones of that cathedral
formed of souls and of centuries
for the glory of God.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> With
such thoughts, the day appears short,
and labor assumes an exquisite character.
What joy to say, “I work
with the entire universe; I work as
God himself has set me the example.”</p>

<p>Still further, we promise you honor
and pride. The Christian workman,
he whom we hope to see multiplied
in Paris, loves his trade; he is proud
of it, and would blush if he did not
prefer it to all others. He contemplates
with satisfaction the work
which he has just accomplished, and,
like the Creator, with innocent simplicity,
finds it beautiful. He attempts
without jealousy to equal and
even surpass the best workmen of his
kind. He thinks that his country
should be the most honorable and
the most honored of all, and that
France should be the equal of all
other powers. On this subject he
will not jest, but becomes grave.
If he belongs to a corporation, he is
enthusiastic for the glory of his banner,
and will not allow it to be insulted.
When a man thus respects his
position, he respects himself, and is
led to respect God. Such are the
elements of what I willingly term
the workman’s honor.</p>

<p>We promise you peace of conscience,
the happiness that follows
accomplished duty, the repose in joy.
Every workman among us should say
to his children what one of the most
learned men of the day, the illustrious
Emmanuel de Rougé, wrote in
his will: “May my children preserve
the faith. Repose of mind and
heart can only be found in Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, and the Saviour
of man.” To work, says a
contemporary philosopher, is easy;
to repose is difficult. Man works
without repose when he labors relying
only upon himself; he works
and reposes when he commences by
first confiding himself to God. This
is the repose we offer you; it is supremely
delicious, and the workman
will be led to repose, in working for
others, like good Claude des Huttes,
the stone-cutter of St. Point, the friend
of Lamartine, who, poor as he was,
worked gratuitously for those poorer
than he, and said to himself, when
retiring to rest: “I have earned a
good day’s wages; for the poor pay
me in friendship, my heart pays me
in contentment, and the good God
will pay me in mercy.” O greatness
of the Christian workman!</p>

<p>We promise to labor as unceasingly
for the amelioration of your material
condition as for the enlargement
of your understanding. Evil be to
us if we did not think of the lodging,
warming, nourishment of the
workman’s family; if we would confiscate
science to our profit, and not
extend to you the treasure; if we
ceased for a single instant to open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[760]</a></span>
schools, asylums, circles, conferences,
institutions of peace and of light.
We do not recoil before progress; no
light terrifies us. From texts of the
Gospel, we have and ever will produce
new consequences, religious,
philosophical, and social; and these
conclusions constitute a progress incessant
and ever new&mdash;our progress,
the only true progress.</p>

<p>Finally, we promise to organize
with your aid the workingmen’s associations.
Association only frightens
us when it leans towards despotism,
and we wish principally to give it a
religious character. The confraternity!
an old word, which is ridiculed,
but which in reality is a great
thing; men reunited for one temporal
aim under the protection of God,
their angel guardians, and their celestial
patrons; free men, discussing with
all loyalty the interests of their
trade, and knowing how to govern
themselves. You will invent nothing
better, provided always that, in this
enlarged institution, the Catholic
spirit is harmoniously mingled with
the positive rules of social science.
We are in the midst of a crisis
which cannot last long; to our mutual
aid and co-operative societies
others will succeed more scientifically
organized, and, above all, more
Christian. We hope in this future,
and believe it very near; it is the
ideal for this world now, and for
heaven hereafter&mdash;heaven, which is
the great association of the happy ...</p>

<p class="pc1">III.</p>

<p class="p1">It would seem impossible, in the
face of such doctrines, that any misunderstanding
could exist between
the church and the workman; but
Satan has not understood it in this
manner, and objections pour against
the church.</p>

<p>It has been said repeatedly that
the church has done nothing for the
workman. It is the conclusion that
Victor Hugo has given to his <i>Les
Misérables</i>, and this book has singularly
contributed to develop hatred
in the hearts of the people. Numerous
writers, animated with the same
ardent hate, affirm daily that, to find
society well organized, we must go
back to antiquity, or take 1789 as
the place of departure.</p>

<p>To refute these assertions, we will
first say that, in regard to antiquity,
they forget that it was devoured
by the frightful cancer of slavery;
among the greater part of nations
before Christ, the workmen were
for a long time principally slaves.
Manual labor, which was universally
despised, was performed by entire
nations of slaves, who were paid with
lashes of the whip. Thus were built
many of the magnificent monuments
of the Greeks, and, above all, of the
Romans&mdash;monuments which they
place so far above those of the
present. I remember, one beautiful
October night in the Eternal City,
contemplating with stupefaction the
immense mass of the Coliseum; the
gigantic shafts of the columns which
lay pell-mell at my feet; the colossal
aqueducts defined against the horizon&mdash;all
the splendors which are still
grand even in their ruins. A priest
who accompanied me exclaimed, in
astonished admiration, “You must
acknowledge that the Christian races
have never produced such great
works.”</p>

<p>“‘Tis true,” I replied, “and I
thank God for it; for these monuments
you behold were chiefly constructed
by the hands of slaves, and
we now only employ free workmen,
whom we pay for their labor.”</p>

<p>We do not sufficiently reflect on
this. Obelisks, immense pyramids,
splendid porticos, hippodromes where
so much plebeian blood flowed;
theatres where modesty was brutally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[761]</a></span>
violated; temples where they
adored so many passions, so many
vices; tombs where so much vanity
is revealed; elegant houses, but
where the wife and child were so
little valued; astonishing monuments
of incomparable art, I admire you
much less since I know by whose
hands you were raised. It is not
thus that they have built since the
advent of Jesus Christ and the
church.</p>

<p>There is in history a proposition
of more than mathematical clearness,
which I declare solemnly to be true;
it is that <i>the church destroyed slavery</i>.
It is the church that gradually transformed
the slave into the serf; that by
degrees compelled society, formed by
her, to change the serf into the freeman.
This is established by the
records, century after century, year
after year, day after day. It is true,
the church did not improvise in an
hour this admirable change, this
marvellous progress; it is not her
custom to improvise, and, truth to say,
she improvises nothing; she moves
slowly but surely. She never roused
the slaves to revolt, but she recalled
the masters to their duty. She gave
great care to the question of marriage
between slaves; for, with intelligent
foresight, she knew that the
whole future depended on it: briefly,
in 300, there were millions of slaves&mdash;in
1000, not one.</p>

<p>Everywhere existed admirable
confraternities of workmen, who worked
without pay on the numerous
cathedrals scattered throughout Europe;
thousands of men labored
gratuitously for God, or nobly earned
their living in working for their
brothers. Will you deny this fact? I
defy you to do it. The church conquered
for the workmen two inappreciable
things&mdash;liberty and dignity;
and, for so many benefits, she too
often receives but ingratitude and
forgetfulness. One day, while rambling
through the wide streets of
Oxford, that city of twenty-four
colleges, formerly founded by the
church, and which live to-day on
those foundations of our fathers, I
inquired if there could be found a
Catholic Church. I was conducted
into a kind of room, narrow and low,
which many of your employers would
not use for a factory or shop. That
was what they condescended to lease
the holy church of God in the splendid
city, built with her hands, and
bathed in her sweat. It is thus with
the working-class, which is also a
creation of the church; its mother is
forgotten, and it is with difficulty
that she is left a little corner in the
workshop; but it is there we will endeavor
to replace her with honor,
and then each one of you can say
with the poet Jasmin: “I remember
that, when I was young, the church
found me naked, and clothed me;
now that I am a man, I find her
naked, in my turn I will cover her.”
It is this cry we wish to hear from
you.</p>

<p>Again, we hear that “the church is
not the same to the rich and to the
poor.” When will it be proved,
when can it be shown, that there are
two Creeds, two Decalogues, two
codes of morality, two families of
sacraments, two dogmas, two disciplines,
two altars&mdash;one for the use of
the great ones of the earth, the
other destined for the poor? It can
never be done. They can bring forward
a certain number of facts; they
can cite abuses more or less deplorable,
and which we condemn implacably;
but the equality remains entire. I go
further, and affirm that the church
has unceasingly favored the humble,
the weak, and the laborers. They
are her privileged ones, and she has
well shown it.</p>

<p>Another objection current among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[762]</a></span>
the working-class, another calumny
which has triumphed over the minds
of the people, unworthily deceived,
is the scandalous assertion that “the
church is the enemy of instruction,”
and this abominable falsehood is,
above all, applied to primary instruction.
Now, it is mathematically
proved that, before the establishment
of the church, there did not
exist in the much-lauded antiquity a
single school for workmen. This
first proposition is clearly evident,
and it is not less mathematically demonstrated
that, since the advent of
the church, “free schools have been
attached to each parish, and confided
to the direction of the clergy.”
Such are the words of a learned man
of our day, who has best appreciated
this question, and who, in order to
establish his conclusion, appeals to
texts the most luminously authentic.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
We will not pause here to speak of
the profound love of Christ for the
ignorant&mdash;that love which shines
forth in every page of the Gospel;
nor will we linger over the epoch of
the persecution of the early church;
but we will transport ourselves to
France in the first period of our history.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the VIth
century, the Council of Vaison declares
that for a <i>long time</i> in Italy
“the priests had brought up young
students in their own houses, and
instructed them like good fathers in
faith and sound knowledge.” In the
year 700, a Council of Rouen goes
further, and commands <i>all Christians</i>
to send their children to the city
school: is not that instruction Christianly
free and Christianly obligatory?
Meanwhile, Charlemagne appears,
and watches energetically that
these noble lights shall not be extinguished,
or that they may be relighted.
In 797, a capitulary of
Theodulph offers these admirable
words: “That the priests should establish
schools in the villages and
boroughs, and that no pay should be
exacted from the children in return.”
The same decrees are found in the
canons of the Council of Rome in
826, in the bulls of Pope Leo IV.,
and in the capitulary of Hérard,
Archbishop of Tours, in 858.</p>

<p>Observe that these last quotations
belong to the darkest, most savage
epoch of our history. Feudalism
reigned supreme; that redoubtable
institution had recently come into
existence, without having yet at its
side the Christian counterpoise of
chivalry. But if we make a leap of
two or three hundred years, and arrive
at the XIIth and XIIIth centuries,
all becomes brilliant, and history
can furnish the list of all the
schools that then existed even in the
smallest villages. These statistics
are extant, and can be consulted;
and from so many accumulated
documents, which extend from 529
to 1790, the conclusion, rigorously
scientific, must be drawn that “from
a distant period, even at the foundation
of our parishes, the clergy in the
country dispensed instruction to the
agricultural classes. It was thus
throughout the middle ages; and
even at a recent epoch we have seen
the priests in many parishes perform
the functions of teachers.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> What
do our adversaries think of such exact
testimony? All the schools,
then, having been founded by the
church, what satanic skill was needed
to persuade the people that the
church had not established one!</p>

<p>Still more scandalous is the objection
that the church has failed in
her errand of mercy; for they accuse
her of not having sufficiently loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[763]</a></span>
the poor and abandoned. We were
stupefied, several years ago, to find
this strange assertion in a celebrated
review: that the church owed to the
Protestants the idea of the Sisters
of Charity. Now, we have before
our eyes acts truly innumerable, establishing
clearly that there were
many thousand institutions of charity
in France in the XIIth and XIIIth
centuries. During the first ages of
the church, in the midst of the persecution,
the poor, <i>all poor</i>, were assisted
in their homes by the deacons;
and, after the persecutions, these
same poor were reunited in splendid
palaces, which were divided into
as many classes as there were miseries
to relieve. But for the fear of
being called pedants, we would cite
here the <i>Bretotrophia</i>, or asylums
for children; the <i>Nosocomia</i>, or
houses for the sick; the <i>Orphanotrophia</i>,
reserved for orphans; and the
<i>Gerontocomia</i>, consecrated to old age.</p>

<p>Such establishments continued to
exist from the XIIth and XIIIth
centuries in all the episcopal cities,
in the monastic centres, and in the
humblest parishes, where they never
ceased, during the Christian ages, to
soothe the suffering, feed the hungry,
counsel the erring, and instruct the
ignorant. By these we are easily
led to the XIVth and XVth centuries,
when we behold so many hospitals,
so many charitable institutions,
flourishing on the surface of the
Christian soil. Where are the tears
the church has not dried? the nakedness
she has not covered? the captives
she has not redeemed? the
sick she has not visited? the strangers
she has not received? the dead
she has not buried with her tears?
the sinners she has not pressed to
her heart? the children she has not
made smile, and has not instructed
and consoled? the laborers she has
not loved? This is a blow to error
and misrepresentation; the proofs are
clear&mdash;you can, you <i>must</i> read them.</p>

<p>Again, they object that “the
church does not occupy herself at
the present time with the <i>social, the
labor question</i>.” I can show a hundred
books, bearing the greatest Catholic
names, entirely consecrated to this
new science. For eighteen hundred
years, the church has not ceased for
an instant to put political economy
into action; for she has not ceased
an instant to lean towards all miseries
to relieve them; towards all enjoyments
to purify them. Without ever
having regarded sacrifice and resignation
as the last solution of the
social problem; without ever having
renounced the hope of seeing the
reign of God in a happier future, she
has never ceased to preach resignation
to the weak, and sacrifice to the
powerful. For eighteen hundred
years, the church has also written
her economical theory; for, on account
of the intimate connection
between the social question and
theology, it can be said with all
truth that, up to the XIXth century,
there have been as many books
written of political economy as treatises
of theology.</p>

<p>Thanks be to God, the day has
arrived when a science has been
founded entirely consecrated to the
study of the social question. Far
from recoiling before it, the church
has valiantly advanced to the charge.
Undoubtedly she has a hundred
other works on hand, and is obliged
to choose the hour when she commences
the task; the hour has sounded
in this same house, where you
listen to me with so much patience;
every Monday a modest council is
held, which also wishes to take the
name of <i>Jésus-Ouvrier</i>. From all
parts of Paris come representatives
of the religious orders, and for that
they joyfully sacrifice every occupation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[764]</a></span>
they occupy themselves with
the labor question and the workman.
These meetings last two, three, and
even four hours. They seek to study
the principles which govern this
question; the history of the efforts
that have been made until the present
day in favor of the workman;
the obstacles which oppose the solution
of this grand problem; and,
finally, the remedies which can be
brought to bear upon these accumulated
evils. This is what is done by
these priests, these religious, these
Catholics; they will review one after
the other the workman, the workingman’s
family, the workingman’s
association. This is the plan of the
book whose materials they are gathering;
these are the three parts of a
species of theology of labor which
they are preparing in concert. In
twenty other places in Paris are held
twenty other assemblies, not less
Catholic, animated by the same
spirit, pursuing the same end; and
we can now say that the principle of
Catholic social economy is erected.</p>

<p>I will now conclude, and throw a
last glance over the space we have
traversed together. I commenced
with the cross, and will finish with it.</p>

<p>In one of our romances of chivalry,
it is related that the wood of the
cross borne in front of the Christian
army in a battle against the Saracens
suddenly assumed gigantic and miraculous
proportions; it touched the
sky, and was more luminous than the
sun. The infidels, seized with terror,
broke and fled, and the Christians
counted another victory. The cross
of the Circles of Workingmen is
small, very small, and will not probably
be the subject of such a prodigy;
nevertheless, I hope that its gentle
light will end by assuring the victory;
and the victory that we desire is that
the workman may be thrown in the
arms of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c765" id="c765">AN EVENING IN CHAMBLY.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago, upon occasion of
a visit to Rev. F. Mignault, at Chambly,
we were most agreeably surprised
to meet an old and valued
friend whom we had not seen or
even heard from for many years.
We had known him as a Protestant
physician in Upper Canada, and our
surprise was none the less to see him
now in the habit of a Catholic priest.</p>

<p>After the first salutations, tea was
served, when we all withdrew to the
cosey parlor of our reverend host&mdash;which
none can ever forget who
have once participated in its genial
warmth, and inhaled the kindly atmosphere
of its old-time hospitality&mdash;and
settled ourselves for a long winter
evening of social delight.</p>

<p>Our chat was opened by eager inquiries
of the friend, whom we had
known as Dr. Morris, touching the
change in his religion and profession.
After some hesitation, and smiling at
the urgency of our request for his
narrative, he complied, saying:</p>

<p class="pp4 p1">“Should the tale tire you, let this challenge stand</p>
<p class="pp8">For my excuse.”</p>

<p class="p1">My medical course was completed
in a Scotch university, at an earlier
age than was usual with students of
the profession.</p>

<p>Immediately after receiving my
diploma, I joined a colony of my
countrymen who were leaving for
the wild regions of Upper Canada.
After our arrival, not relishing the
rough life in “the bush,” I decided
to settle in the little village of Brockville,
instead of remaining with the
colony.</p>

<p>During the progress of the last
war between Great Britain and the
United States, I had a professional
call to go up the St. Lawrence, a
two days’ journey.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning in June
when, having accomplished the object
of my visit, I set out on my return
trip. I was then a stranger to
that region, and, attracted by the peculiar
beauty of the scenery on the
river, I determined to leave the dusty
highway, and enjoy a stroll along its
banks for a few miles. Accordingly,
dismissing my man with the carriage,
and directing him to await my arrival
at a little inn some miles below,
I turned my steps towards the majestic
stream, whose flowing waters
and wide expanse formed a leading
feature of the charming landscape
before me, and an appropriate finish
or boundary upon which the eye
rested with ever-increasing satisfaction
and delight.</p>

<p>I had loitered on, absorbed in
contemplation of the shifting scene,
pausing occasionally to watch the
changes wrought by the wing of the
passing zephyr as it touched the polished
mirror here and there, leaving
a ripple more like a magic shadow
upon its surface than any ruffling of
its peaceful bosom, and peering into
its abysses, with the eye of an eager
enthusiast, to see&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Within the depths of its capacious breast<br />
Inverted trees, and rocks, and azure skies,”</p>

<p class="pn1">lulled, the while, by the blissful consciousness
of present beauty, to forget
that&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">“Garry’s hills were far remote,</p>
<p class="pp6">The streams far distant of my native glens”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn1">over the thoughts of which my
homesick spirit was but too prone to
brood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[766]</a></span></p>

<p>I had reached a close thicket of
low bushes that skirted the water’s
edge, when my steps were suddenly
arrested by a rustling sound a little in
advance of me. Peeping cautiously
through the leafy screen of my secure
hiding-place, I saw what seemed
to my excited fancy more like an
apparition from another world than
aught that belonged to this. Upon the
gentle slope of a hill which descended
to the water, and close upon the bank,
stood a gigantic tree that threw its
shadows far into the stream, and at
the foot of it sat a youthful maiden
with a book in her hand, the rustling
leaves of which had first attracted
my attention. She seemed at times
to pore intently over its pages, and
at others to be lost in reverie, while
her eyes roamed anxiously up and
down the river.</p>

<p>As she reclined on the bank, her
slight form enveloped in the cloud-like
folds of a white morning-dress, it
was easy to imagine her the <i>Undine</i>
of those wild solitudes, conning the
mystic page that was unfolding to
her the mysterious lore, hidden from
mortal ken, through which the power
of her enchantments should be
gained and exercised. While I
gazed with admiring wonder upon
the serene intelligence and varying
light which played about her fair features,
and rested like a glory upon
her uplifted brow, I was surprised by
the soft tones of a voice proceeding
from the tangled underwood that
clothed the upward sweep of the
hill: “Sits the pale-face alone on this
bright summer morning?”</p>

<p>“O Magawiska! how you startled
me, breaking so suddenly upon
my dreams! I was indeed sitting
alone under the shade of this old
tree, pondering over a page in history;
counting the white sails far up
and down among the Thousand Islands;
watching the boiling whirlpools
in the waters of our dear old
St. Lawrence; and thinking of more
things than I should care to enumerate,
when your voice broke the spell,
and disenchanted me. How is it,
Magawiska, that my sisters of the
wilderness always approach so softly,
taking us, as it were, unawares?”</p>

<p>“In that, we do but follow the example
given by all things which the
Great Spirit has created to inhabit
the forest. But come away with
me, my White Dove, to the wigwam.
That page in history is turned, and
strong hands are even now writing
the next one in letters of blood!
Many a white sail has glanced
through the mazes of the Thousand
Islands that will never thread that
fairy dance again, and the waters, so
pure below, are already tinged further
toward their source with the
heart’s blood of many a brave soldier!
Let my fair one come away;
for old Honey Bee, the medicine-woman,
has just returned from Chippewa,
and may bring some news of
the gallant young captain who commands
the <i>Water-witch</i>. Floated not
the thoughts of my pale sister to
him from the folds of the white sails
she was so busy counting?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Magawiska! But your
words alarm me. Surely the Honey
Bee has no bad tidings for me from
him you name! What can she know
of him?”</p>

<p>“I know not; only I heard her
whispering to my mother in the Indian
tongue, and was sure she uttered
the name of the Lightfoot more
than once.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will go with you, and
hear whatever news she has for
me.”</p>

<p>“Will my sister venture through
the Vale of the Spirit-flowers, by
crossing which the distance to the
wigwam is so greatly shortened?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you are sure you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[767]</a></span>
the way perfectly; for I have never
traversed its dreary depths myself.”</p>

<p>“Never fear! the Dove shall be as
safe in the home of the wild bird as
in the nest of its mother.” Saying
which, the young daughter of the
woods glided away over the hill, followed
by her fair companion.</p>

<p>As they vanished, I quietly
emerged from my hiding-place and
followed them at a distance, creeping
cautiously along to avoid awakening
any sounds in the echoing forests,
into which we soon entered,
that would reach the quick ear of
the young native, and at the same
time making a passing note of her
appearance. She was quite young
and beautiful for one of her race.
Her form was very slight and graceful
in every motion, while her light,
elastic step seemed scarcely to press
the tender herbage and moss under
her feet in her noiseless course. As
she passed along, she ever and anon
cast a sly glance over her shoulder,
smiling mischievously to see the difficulty
with which her companion
kept pace with her rapid movements
through the tangled recesses of the
forest. After descending the opposite
side of the hill, they entered the
dingle at its base to which the
young squaw had alluded. I was
startled when I found myself enshrouded
in its dim shadows. So
faint was the light therein on this
cloudless June morning as to make
it difficult to realize that the hour
was not midnight! I could discern
something white upon the ground
that I conjectured was mould which
had gathered in those damp shades.
Upon examining more closely, I found
it to be a vegetable growth, embracing
in form every variety of wild
flowers that abounded in the neighboring
woods, but entirely colorless,
owing to the total absence of light.
I gathered a quantity of these singular
“spirit-flowers,” which presented
the appearance of transparent crystallizations,
hoping to inspect them
by the full light of day; but the moment
they were exposed to the sun,
to my great surprise they melted like
snowflakes, leaving only fine fibres,
like wet strings, in my hands.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>When they reached the wigwam,
I secreted myself in a thicket near
by, where I could hear the conversation
between the old squaw and the
beautiful stranger; for having then
less knowledge of the Indian character
than I afterwards acquired, I
could not feel quite safe to leave her
so entirely in their power. “Magawiska
tells me,” she said, with the
blushing hesitation of maidenly reserve,
“that you have just returned
from a distant voyage, and may
know something of events which are
taking place far up the wilderness of
waters.”</p>

<p>“And if the Honey Bee knows,
and should fill your ear with tales of
bitterness, would not the pale-face
say she was more ready to sting the
child she loves than to nourish her
with sweetness? No, my White
Dove! return to the nest of thy
mother, and seek not to hear of ills
for which there is no cure!”</p>

<p>“I must know, and I will not go
until you have told me!” she
vehemently cried. “For the love
of heaven! my mother, if you know
aught of the Lightfoot, tell me; for I
can bear any ills I know better than
the dread of those I know not!”</p>

<p>“Even so; if the Bee must wound
the heart she would rather die than
grieve, even so; the will of the Great
Spirit must be done, and may he
heal what he has broken! There
has been a mighty battle; the foes
of thy father are the victors. The
<i>Water-witch</i> went down in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[768]</a></span>
of the fight. The Lightfoot was
known to be on deck and wounded
when it sank. Thy father is maddened
at the triumph of his foes, but
rejoices over the fall of him whom
he hated for his bravery in their
cause, for his religion, and for the
love the young brave had won from
the only daughter of the old man’s
heart and home.”</p>

<p>How my bosom throbbed in
painful sympathy with the moans
and stifled sobs that burst from the
young heart, crushed under the
weight of this series of dire calamities,
knowing that no human aid or
pity could avail for its relief! After
some time, she whispered faintly:
“Is there, then, no hope for the poor
broken heart, so suddenly bereft of
its betrothed? Oh! tell me, my
good mother of the wilderness, is
there no possibility that he may
have escaped? If I could but see
him, and hear his gentle voice
utter one assurance of constancy
and affection, even if it were his
last, I think I could be reconciled.
But this terrible, unlooked-for parting!
Say, mother, may he not have
escaped? May I not see him once
again in life?”</p>

<p>“The hand of the Great Spirit is
powerful to heal as to bruise! Since
it was not raised to protect and
snatch thy beloved from death
when no other could have saved him,
look to it alone, my child, for the
comfort thou wilt seek elsewhere in
vain! Were there not hundreds of
my brethren who would gladly have
given their heart’s blood for the life
that was dearer than their own, and
had been offered in many conflicts
to shield them and theirs from
danger? I tell thee, pale daughter
of a cruel foe, that wailing and lamentation
went up from the camp of the
red men when the eyes of its fiercest
warriors were melted to women’s
tears at the sight I have told thee
of!”</p>

<p>Nothing more was said, and soon
after the young stranger departed,
accompanied by Magawiska.</p>

<p>A few days later, I was summoned
in the night to attend upon a wounded
soldier on the American shore of
the St. Lawrence. I entered a bark
canoe with a tall Indian, whose
powerful arm soon impelled the light
vessel across the broad, swift stream.
After landing, he conducted me into
a dense and pathless forest, through
which I had extreme difficulty in
making my way with sufficient speed
to keep within ear-shot of my guide.
To see him was out of the question;
the interlaced and overhanging foliage,
though the moon was shining,
excluded every ray of light,
so that my course was buried in
bewildering darkness. A long and
fatiguing tramp through the woods
brought us at length to a cluster of
wigwams, and I was conducted to
the most spacious one&mdash;the lodge
of the “Leader of Prayer”&mdash;where
I found a remarkably fine-looking
young officer lying, faint from loss
of blood and the fatigue of removal.
A Catholic missionary, whom I had
frequently met by the bedside of
the sick, and in the course of his
journeys from one encampment to
another of his Indian missions, was
sitting by him, bathing his hands
and face in cold water, and whispering
words of encouragement and
consolation during every interval of
momentary consciousness.</p>

<p>From him I learned that the Indians
from the scene of action up the
lake had brought the wounded man
thus far on the way to his friends, at
his earnest request. So anxious was
he to reach home that he would not
consent to stop for rest after they
left their boat, although the increased
motion renewed the bleeding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
the wound, which had been partially
checked, until he was so far exhausted
as to become wholly unconscious,
when they halted here, having
brought him through the woods on
a litter. The priest had given him
some restoratives, but had been unable
to check the flow of blood, which
was fast draining the vital current.
He had administered the last sacraments
to the young man, who belonged
to a family of Catholics who
had recently removed from Utica to
a new settlement on the borders of
Black Lake.</p>

<p>I made a hasty examination, and
soon discovered the position of the
bullet. I succeeded in extracting it,
after which the bleeding was speedily
and in a great measure staunched.</p>

<p>From the moment I looked upon
him, however, I regarded his recovery
as more than doubtful. Had the
case received earlier attention, and
the fatigue of removal been avoided,
there was a possibility that youthful
energy might have carried him
through the severe ordeal; though
the wound would have been critical
under the most favorable circumstances.</p>

<p>When he became conscious for a
moment during the operation, and
looked in my face, he comprehended
the office I was performing, and read
in my countenance the fears and
doubts which possessed my mind.</p>

<p>“Do not leave me, doctor, until
all is over,” he faintly said. “This
reverend father will acquaint my
friends with my fate, for he knows
them.”</p>

<p>I assured him I would remain with
him, and he relapsed into the stupor
which I feared would be final.</p>

<p>We watched by him with silent
solicitude. While the priest was
deeply absorbed over the pages of
his breviary, my thoughts wandered
from the painful present back to the
dear old land from which I was a
lonely, homesick exile; to bright
scenes of the past, fond memories of
which neither time nor absence could
obliterate, and drew a vivid contrast
between them and the circumstances
of my new life, especially at this
hour. What would the dear friends
with whom I had parted for ever
think if they could see me in the
midst of this wild and dismal scene,
surrounded by the rudest features
of savage life? With what dismay
would they not listen to the howling
of wolves and the shrieking of catamounts
in the woods around us?
How sadly would the continually
repeated plaint of the “whippoorwill”
fall upon their ear; while, to
heighten the gloomy effect of the
weird concert, the echoing forests
resounded with the shrill notes of the
screech-owl, answered, as if in derision,
by their multitudinous laughing
brothers, whose frantic “Ha! ha!
ha!” seemed like the exulting mockery
of a thousand demons over the
anxious vigil in that Indian wigwam.
I was gloomily pursuing this train
of thought, when a slight movement
near the entrance of the lodge arrested
my attention, and aroused me
from my reverie. Turning my eye
in that direction, I perceived by the
dim light the form of old Honey
Bee entering softly, accompanied by
a female, in whom, as she approached
the wounded man and the light fell
upon her face, I recognized, to my
astonishment, the <i>Undine</i> of my former
adventure. But, oh! the change
a few short days had wrought in that
fair face! The very lineaments had
been so transformed from their radiant
expression of careless joy to the
settled pallor and marble-like impress
of poignant anguish that I could
scarcely bring myself to believe it
was the same.</p>

<p>Calmly she approached and knelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[770]</a></span>
by the sufferer, taking his hand and
bowing her fair forehead upon it.
Thus she remained for some time
in speechless agony, when my ears
caught the whispered prayer: “O
my God! if there is pity in heaven
for a poor broken heart, let him look
upon me once more! Let me hear his
gentle voice once again!” Then,
placing her mouth to his ear, she
said clearly, in a low, pleading tone:</p>

<p>“Will you not speak to me once
again, my own betrothed?”</p>

<p>Slowly, as if by a painful effort,
the drooping eyelids lifted the long
lashes from his cheek, and his eyes
rested with unutterable tenderness
upon the pale face which was bending
over him. “Oh! speak to me!
Say if you know me!” she pleaded,
with convulsive earnestness.</p>

<p>Repeatedly did the colorless lips
vainly essay to speak, and at length
the words were wrenched from them,
as it were, in broken sentences, by
the agonized endeavor:</p>

<p>“My own, my best beloved! May
God bless and comfort you! I leave
you with him! He is good to the
living and the dying. Trust in him,
my own love, and he will never fail
you. I am going to him, but I will
pray for you ever, ever!” Then,
with another strong effort, while a
sweet smile stole over the features
upon which death had set his seal,
“Tell your father I forgive all!”
A gurgling sound&mdash;a faint gasp&mdash;and
the light went out from the large
dark eyes, the hand which had held
hers relapsed its grasp, and, before
the holy priest had closed the prayers
for the departing spirit, all was over!</p>

<p>It was the old, old story, repeated
again and again, alike in every village
and hamlet, on the bosom of
old ocean, in the city and in the
wilderness, through all the ages since
the angel of death first spread his
wings over a fallen world, and carried
their dark shadow into happy
homes, banishing the sunlight, leaving
only the cloud. The same story,
“ever ancient and ever new,” which
will be repeated again and again for
every inhabitant of earth until “time
shall be no longer,” yet will always
fall with new surprise upon the ears
of heart-stricken survivors, as if they
had never before heard of its dread
mysteries! Thank God that it
closes for those souls whose loved
ones “rest in hope” with consolations
that become, in time, ministering
angels over life’s dark pathway,
smoothing the ruggedness, lighting up
the gloom, even unto the entrance of
the valley whose shadows are those
of death, and supporting them with
tender aid through the dread passage.</p>

<p>Long did we remain in a silence
broken only by bitter sobs pressed
from the bleeding heart of that
youthful mourner. One by one the
Indians, each with his rosary in his
hand, had entered noiselessly and
reverently knelt, until the lodge was
filled with a pious and prayerful assemblage.</p>

<p>In the course of my profession,
I had witnessed many death-bed
scenes, but had never become so
familiar with the countenance of the
pallid messenger as to be a mere
looker-on. A sense of the “awfulness
of life” deepened upon me with
each repetition of the vision of death.
But I had never before been present
at one that so entirely melted my
whole being as this&mdash;so striking in
all the attributes of wild and touching
pathos!</p>

<p>God forgive me! I had hitherto
lived without a thought of him or
his requirements, and wholly indifferent
to all religion. My life, though
unstained by vice, had been regulated
by no religious motives, and, so
far as any interest in religion was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[771]</a></span>
question, beyond a certain measure
of decent outward respect, I might
as well have claimed to be a pagan
as a Christian. I resolved by that
death-bed, while I held the cold hand
of that lifeless hero in mine, and
mingled my tears with those of the
broken-hearted mourner, that it
should be so no longer! Then and
there I resolved to begin a new life,
and offered myself to God and to his
service in whatever paths it should
please his hand to point out to me.</p>

<p>As the morning dawned, old
Honey Bee, with gentle persuasions
and affectionate urgency, drew the
afflicted maiden away, and I saw her
no more. I assisted the good priest to
prepare the remains of the young
officer for the removal, which he was
to conduct, and then sought his advice
and guidance in my own spiritual
affairs, freely opening to him the
history of my whole life. After receiving
such directions as I required,
and promising to see him again soon
at Brockville, I returned by the way
I went, and never revisited that vicinity.</p>

<p>Some weeks later, I was called to
the residence of a well-known British
officer, a leader of the Orangemen in
Upper Canada, to attend a consultation
with several older physicians upon
the case of his daughter, who was
lying in a very alarming state with a
fever. Upon entering the apartment
of the patient, I was again surprised
to discover in this victim of disease
the lovely mourner of that
sad scene in the wilderness. She
lay in a partial stupor, and, when
slightly roused, would utter incoherent
and mysterious expressions connected
with the events of that night,
and painful appeals, which were understood
by none but myself, who
alone had the key to their meaning.</p>

<p>If I had formerly been amazed to
see the change a few days had accomplished,
how much more was I now
shocked at the ravages wrought by
sorrow and disease! Could it be
possible that the shrivelled and hollow
mask before me represented the
fair face that had been so lately
blooming in beauty&mdash;shining with the
joy of a glad and innocent heart?</p>

<p>The anguish of her haughty father
was pitiful to see! Determined not
to yield to the pressure of a grief
which was crushing his proud spirit,
his effort to maintain a cool and dignified
demeanor unsustained by any
aid, human or divine, was a spectacle
to make angels weep. Alas! for the
heart of poor humanity! In whatever
petrifactions of paltry pride it
may be encrusted, there are times
when its warm emotions will burst
the shell, and assert their own with
volcanic power! When the attending
physician announced the result
of the consultation, in the unanimous
opinion that no further medical aid
could be of any avail, he stalked up
and down the room for some time
with rapid strides; then, pausing before
me, and fixing his bloodshot
eyes on my face, exclaimed violently,
“It is <i>better so</i>! I tell you, it is <i>better</i>
even so, than that I should have
seen her married to that Yankee Jacobin
and Papist! At least, I have
been spared that disgrace! But my
daughter! Oh! she was my only
one; peerless in mind, in person, and
in goodness; and must she die?
Ha! it is mockery to say so! It
cannot be that such perfection was
created only to be food for worms!
As God is good, it may not, <i>shall
not</i>, be!”</p>

<p>While he was uttering these frantic
exclamations, a thought struck me
like an inspiration. The image of
old Honey Bee arose suddenly before
my mind. I remembered that she
had gained the reputation among
the settlers of performing marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[772]</a></span>
cures in cases of this kind by the use
of such simples as her knowledge of
all the productions of the fields and
forests and their medicinal properties
had enabled her to obtain and
apply.</p>

<p>Therefore, when the haughty officer
paused, I ventured to suggest to his
ear and her mother’s only, that the
Indian woman might possibly be
able to make such applications as
might at least alleviate the violence
of the painful and alarming symptoms.
He was at first highly indignant
at the proposal of even bringing
one of that hated race into his house,
much less would he permit one to
minister to his daughter. But when
I respectfully urged that she be
brought merely as a nurse, in which
vocation many of her people were
known to excel, and which I had
known her to exercise with great
skill in the course of my practice,
failing not to mention her love and
admiration for the sufferer, the entreaties
of the sorrow-stricken, anxious
mother were joined with mine, and
prevailed to obtain his consent. I
was requested to remain until she
should arrive. Nothing was said of
the matter to the other physicians,
who soon took their leave.</p>

<p>When the old friend of the hapless
maiden arrived, she consented
to take charge of the case only upon
condition that she should be left entirely
alone with the patient, and be
permitted to pursue her own course
without interruption or interference.
It was difficult to bring the imperious
officer to these terms; but my
confidence in the fidelity of the
old squaw, and increasing assurance
that the only hope of relief for the
sufferer lay in the remedies she
might use, combined with the prayers
of her mother, won his reluctant
consent, if I could be permitted to
see his daughter daily, and report
her condition. This I promised to
do, and found no difficulty in obtaining
the permission of the new
practitioner to that effect.</p>

<p>Whether the presence of a sympathizing
friend assisted the treatment
pursued I do not know. There are
often mysterious sympathies and influences
whose potency baffles the
wisdom of philosophers and the researches
of science. Certain it is
that, to my own astonishment, no
less than to that of the gratified
parents, there was a manifest improvement
in the condition of their
daughter from the hour her new
nurse undertook the charge.</p>

<p>In a few weeks, the attendance of
old Honey Bee was no longer necessary.
The joy and gratitude of
the father knew no bounds. He
would gladly have forced a large
reward upon her for services which
had proved so successful, but she rejected
it, saying: “The gifts that
the Great Spirit has guided the
Honey Bee to gather are not the
price of silver and gold. Freely he
gives them; as freely do his red children
dispense them. They would
scorn to barter the lore he imparts
for gold. Enough that the daughter
of the white chief lives. Let
him see that he quench not the
light of her young life again in his
home!”</p>

<p>“What does she mean?” he muttered,
as she departed. “Does she
know? But no, she cannot; it must
be some surmise gathered from expressions
of my daughter in her delirium.”</p>

<p>In accordance with my promise,
I had called daily during the attendance
of the Indian woman, who
found opportunity, from time to
time, to explain to me the circumstances
attending the rescue of the
Lightfoot.</p>

<p>The Indians, by whom he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[773]</a></span>
greatly beloved, supposed, when they
saw his vessel go down, that he was
lost, as they knew him to have been
badly wounded. A solitary Indian
from another detachment was a witness
of the catastrophe while he
was guiding his canoe in a direction
opposite to that of the encampment,
and on the other side of the scene
of action. He dashed at once with
his frail bark into the midst of the
affray, to render assistance, if possible,
to any who might have escaped
from the ill-fated vessel. While
he was watching, to his great joy
he saw the young officer rise to the
surface, and was able to seize and
draw him into the canoe. As he
was passing to the shore, he was
noticed by the father of the officer’s
betrothed, and the nature of his
prize discovered. A volley of musketry
was immediately directed upon
the canoe, and the Indian received a
mortal wound. He was so near the
shore that he was rescued by his
party, but died soon after landing.</p>

<p>I told her that I had heard the
remainder of the story from the
missionary at the wigwam.</p>

<p>She then informed me that, after
she came to take charge of the
maiden, as soon as her patient became
sufficiently conscious to realize
her critical condition, she had
implored so piteously that the priest
might be sent for that it was impossible
to refuse. When he came&mdash;privately,
of course, for it was too
well known that her father would
never consent to such a visit&mdash;she
entreated permission to profess the
Catholic faith without delay. After
some hesitation, the priest consented
when he found her well instructed
in its great and important truths,
heard her confession, her solemn
profession of faith, and administered
conditional baptism; following the
rite by the consoling and transcendent
gift which is at once the life
and nourishment of the Catholic
soul and the sun of the Catholic
firmament.</p>

<p>The squaw dreaded the violence
of her father when he should discover
what had transpired, and enjoined
it upon me to shield the victim,
if possible, from the storm of his
wrath. Alas! she little dreamed
how powerless I should prove in
such a conflict!</p>

<p>Before the strength of the invalid
was established, that discovery was
made. I had known much of the
unreasoning bigotry and black animosity
which was cherished by the
Orange faction against Catholics;
but I was still wholly unprepared
for his savage outbreak. He heaped
curses upon his daughter’s head, and
poured forth the most bitter and
blasphemous lamentations that she
had been permitted to live only to
bring such hopeless disgrace upon his
gray hairs.</p>

<p>Despite the mother’s tears and
prayers, he ordered her from the
house, and forbade her ever to return
or to call him father again.
Once more did old Honey Bee
come to the rescue of her <i>protégée</i>.
Her affectionate fears had made her
vigilant, and, when the maiden was
driven from her father’s house, she
was received and conducted to a
wigwam which had been carefully
prepared for her reception. Here
she was served with the most tender
assiduity until able to be removed
to Montreal, whither her kind nurse
attended her, and she entered at once
upon her novitiate in a convent there.</p>

<p>The day after her departure, I
also took my leave of that part of the
country, and, proceeding to a distant
city, entered the ecclesiastical state.
In due time, I was ordained to the
new office of ministering to spiritual
instead of physical ills, my vocation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[774]</a></span>
to which was clearly made known to
me by that death-bed in the wilderness.</p>

<p>And now that I have related to
you how the Protestant doctor became
a Catholic priest, I must ask,
in my turn, how it happened that you
and your family became Catholics.</p>

<p>“The story is soon told,” we replied.
“Very probably our attention
might never have been called to
the subject but for a great affliction
which was laid upon us in the sufferings
of our only and tenderly cherished
daughter. She was blest with
rosy health until her tenth year, and
a merrier little sprite the sun never
shone upon.</p>

<p>“Suddenly disease in its most painful
and hopeless form fastened itself
upon her, and, while sinking under
its oppressive weight, she felt more
and more deeply day by day, with
a thoughtfulness rapidly matured by
suffering, the necessity for such aid
and support as Protestantism failed
to furnish. It was, humanly speaking,
by a mere accident that she discovered
where it might be found.</p>

<p>“During an interval between the
paroxysms of the disease, and a little
more than a year after the first
attack, a missionary priest visited
our place, and her Catholic nurse
obtained our permission to take her
to the house of a neighbor where
Mass was to be celebrated.</p>

<p>“She was deeply impressed with
what she saw, and the fervent address
of that devoted and saintly priest
melted her young heart. She obtained
from him a catechism and
some books of devotion. From that
time her conviction grew and
strengthened that here was the healing
balm her wounded spirit so
much needed. After long persuasion
and many entreaties, we gave
our reluctant consent that she might
avail herself of its benefits by making
profession of the Catholic faith.
To the sustaining power of its holy
influences we owe it that her life,
from which every earthly hope had
been stricken, was made thenceforth
so happy and cheerful as to shed
perpetual sunshine over her home
and its neighborhood.</p>

<p>“By degrees she drew us, at first
unwillingly, and at length irresistibly,
to the consideration of Catholic
verities. Through the grace of
God operating upon these considerations,
our whole family, old and
young, were soon united within the
peaceful enclosure of the ‘household
of faith.’</p>

<p>“When the work of our dear little
missionary was thus happily accomplished,
she was removed from the
home for which she had been the
means of procuring such priceless
blessings to that other and better
home, the joys of which may not
even be imagined here. With grateful
hearts we have proved and realized
that for those whom God sorely
afflicts his bountiful hand also provides
great and abundant consolations.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c775" id="c775">THE STORIES OF TWO WORLDS:</a></h2>

<p class="pc1 reduct">MIDDLEMARCH AND FLEURANGE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Between</span> the world of <i>Middlemarch</i>
and the world of <i>Fleurange</i>
there yawns as wide a moral gulf as
that which nature has set between
the continents. The one is a world
with God, the other without. It is
not that George Eliot’s story partakes
of the characteristics which
usually attach to female novelists,
with their vague interpretations of
the Sixth and Ninth Commandments;
nor, on the other hand, that <i>Fleurange</i>
is in any sense a goody-goody book.
But the authors occupying essentially
different stand-points, all things naturally
wear a different aspect; their
characters are subject to a different
order; all life has a different meaning;
so that, though the subject of
each is humanity, its crosses and
loads of sorrow and pain, rather than
its laughter and gladness; though
the men and women breathe the
same air, are warmed by the same
sun their, faces wet with human
tears, their hearts sore with human
sorrows; nevertheless, through either
book runs an abiding tone felt rather
than heard, like an unseen odor pervading
the atmosphere, which affects
the reader differently throughout.
The characters in the one believe in,
pray to, love, obey, or rebel against a
definite, personal God; the presiding
spirit in the other veils his face, and
it is not for man to say who he is.
The author only sees men and women
gathered together in this world&mdash;how,
they know not; why, it is difficult
to conceive&mdash;and all we know
for certain is that here they are, coming
in contact one with the other,
increasing, multiplying, and dropping
out after each one has added his
necessary mite to the immensity of
the universe.</p>

<p>There are books and writings
which seem rather the production of
an age than of any particular author;
which seem to take up and gather
into one voice the long inarticulate
breathing of a portion of humanity,
dumb hitherto for want of an oracle.
Such were the writings previous to
the first French Revolution; such are
the songs of Ireland; such, after a
certain fashion, is <i>Middlemarch</i>. It
is measuring daily life by the favorite
doctrines of the day, whose holders
profess to see things as they are, and
to judge of them purely and solely by
what they see, explaining them as
best they may. To remind such
people that often the visible is the
appearance only, the invisible the
reality, is to speak to them a language
they will not understand.</p>

<p><i>Middlemarch</i> is a story of English
provincial life as English provincial
life obtained fifty years ago; at the
dawn, that is, practically speaking,
of this wonderful XIXth century;
before California and Australia had
discovered their golden secret, when
steam was still in its infancy, electric
telegraphs unknown, and the
sciences just beginning to take a
bolder flight. In England, O’Connell
was thundering for Catholic
emancipation, and the nation clamoring
for that vague thing in the mouth
of the masses&mdash;reform.</p>

<p>Just as matters were in this chrysalis
state, whilst the masses were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[776]</a></span>
undisturbed by the wonders of the
century, or, if the phrase is better, not
educated up to them, George Eliot
settles down in that dullest of places, an
English provincial district, to give us</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“The story of its life from year to year.”</p>

<p class="p1">The story covers very extensive
ground; all Middlemarch, in fact,
with its parishes and towns, its
churches and taverns, its clergy and
magistrates, its physicians and shopkeepers,
its gentry and its yokels, its
good men and its rascals, its maidens
young and old, its loves and its
hates, its hopes and its fears, its marriages
and deaths, its thoughts, words,
and deeds, from high to low&mdash;such is
the broad scope of the book, and the
author has gathered all in in a manner
to make the reader wonder. Nothing
has escaped her eye. One
seems to have been living in
Middlemarch all his life, and every
character comes and goes with the
face of an old acquaintance. It is
not the author’s fault if the district
be a narrow one&mdash;narrow, that is,
in ideas, in knowledge, in faith, in all
that ennobles man. It is not her
fault if its great ideas take the
shape of “keys to all mythologies”;
if its religion is a poor affair at the
best; if its leading men are religious
hypocrites like Mr. Bulstrode, or philanthropic
asses like Mr. Brooke,
who “goes in” for everything, and
talks the broadest and vaguest philanthropy
whilst he pinches his tenants.
It is not the author’s fault if
generosity find no place in Middlemarch;
if honesty is misunderstood
or at a discount; if the local physicians
throw discredit upon Lydgate
with his youth, his burning desire to
achieve, his cleverness, and his genuine
enthusiasm; if they call his ideas
quackery, because they threaten
their pockets, as the yokels in turn
look upon the railway as destruction,
and hold that steam takes the handle
from the plough and the pitchfork;
as Middlemarch receives Dorothea
Brooke’s generous aspirations
after a higher life than that which, in
response to the question of an ardent
nature, “What can I do?” says,
“Whatever you please, my dear”&mdash;as
“notions” which are wrong in
themselves, because undreamed of
in Middlemarch philosophy, which,
in Miss Brooke are odd, and which,
if carried a little farther, would find
their fitting sphere of action in the
lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>It is not the author’s fault if all
this be so; if there be nothing in
Middlemarch beyond the common
good, and very little even of that,
whilst all the rest is mean, sordid,
crooked, narrow, and outspokenly
wicked. Such is Middlemarch, and
such is it given to us. The only
question is, How far does Middlemarch
extend? Is it restricted to
the English county, or is it a miniature
photograph of the world as seen
by George Eliot?</p>

<p>In the keynote to the whole book,
the prelude, the author cries out
bitterly that in this world and in
these days there is no place for a S.
Teresa. In this assertion, in this
wail rather, the author does not limit
her district to Middlemarch. It is a
doctrine meant to apply to the broad
world. Throughout the book the
same thing is to be observed. Though
with wonderful consistency and truth
of local coloring, and continual recurrence
of petty local questions
and local ideas, the author keeps
the reader in Middlemarch from
beginning to end, nevertheless,
whether with or without intention,
from time to time she strikes out
with broader aim, and flings her sarcasm,
or her observation, or her
moral, such as it may be, in the face
of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[777]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, though it would be
unfair to infer that George Eliot’s
views of the world, its possibilities, its
hopes, its all that makes it what it is,
are confined to the cramped, narrow,
provincial district chosen as the
subject of her story; to allege that
she believes in nothing nobler <i>now</i>
in humanity than what Middlemarch
affords; yet so wide is the district
embraced, so various the subjects
entered into, not merely touched
upon&mdash;religion, politics, the bettering
of the poor, marriage, preparation
for the married state, and the effect
of such preparation on married life,
the thousand conflicts that meet, and
jostle, and combine to make everyday
life what it is&mdash;it is not unfair to
say that the author, in drawing within
this somewhat narrow circle the
main elements which compose humanity,
has taken Middlemarch up
as a scientist would take a basin of
water from the sea to examine it&mdash;not
for the sake of that sample only,
but with a view to the whole.</p>

<p>The chief interest of the story, if
story it can be called, lies in this:
From the outstart, the author warns
you that a S. Teresa has no place in
the world now; and, to prove that
her warning is correct, she takes up
a character, Dorothea Brooke, endows
her with the aspirations after a
great life, fits her naturally, as far as
she can, with every attribute, physical
and moral, which she considers a
S. Teresa ought to possess; with religious
feelings, with the continual
desire to do good, with charity, with
purity, with the spirit of self-sacrifice,
with simplicity, and truth, and
utter unconsciousness of self, with
wealth enough even, as the author
says of Mr. Casaubon, “to lend a
lustre to her piety,” and sets her
down in the narrow Middlemarch
set, where everything runs in a groove,
and life is measured by all the pettinesses,
to see what will become of
her.</p>

<p>The result may as well be told at
once. S. Teresa proves a miserable
failure in Middlemarch. Instead of
marrying, as the world&mdash;that is to
say, Mrs. Cadwallader&mdash;had ordained
she should do, the handsome, florid,
conventional English baronet, Sir
James Chettam, a sort of aristocratic
“Mr. Toots,” who is so amiable
and admires her so much that he
brings her triumphs of nature in the
shape of marvellous Maltese puppies
as presents, and says “exactly” to
all her observations, even when she
desires him to say the contrary&mdash;out
of a spirit of religion, self-sacrifice,
and veneration, and honestly because
she admires the man, or rather the
being dressed out to suit by her own
imagination, she marries Mr. Casaubon,
with his sallow complexion, his
moles, his blinking eyes, and his age,
which is more than double her own.
Unsympathetic to the loving nature of
the girl as a wooden doll whose complexion
has suffered and whose form is
battered by age, but which notwithstanding
the girl invests with all the
qualities and beauty of a Prince
Charming&mdash;a deception that time
alone and that ugly thing, common
sense, can remove&mdash;S. Teresa speedily
discovers that her “divine Hooker,”
as she fondly imagined him, is after all
only “a poor creature,” and she is
probably saved from the divorce
court only by the timely death of
the “divine Hooker.” She discovered
that she had married the wrong
man&mdash;exactly what Middlemarch
told her; and there lies the provoking
part of the story. Middlemarch
was right in its degree, and the woman,
whose ideas soared so high above it,
was all the worse off for not taking
its advice at the outstart. S. Teresa
repents of her sin, and characteristically
atones for it by marrying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[778]</a></span>
right man&mdash;at least, the man she loves
and who loves her&mdash;and is dismissed
in the following remarks, which close
the book:</p>

<p>“Certainly those determining acts
of her life were not ideally beautiful.
They were the mixed result of young
and noble impulse struggling under
prosaic conditions. Among the many
remarks passed on her mistakes, it
was never said in the neighborhood
of Middlemarch that such mistakes
could not have happened if the society
into which she was born had not
smiled on propositions of marriage
from a sickly man to a girl less than
half his own age, on modes of education
which make a woman’s knowledge
another name for motley ignorance,
on rules of conduct which are in flat
contradiction with its own loudly
asserted beliefs. While this is the
social air in which mortals begin to
breathe, there will be collisions such
as those in Dorothea’s life, where
great feelings will take the aspect
of error, and great faith the aspect
of illusion; for there is no creature
whose inward being is so strong that
it is not greatly determined by what
lies outside it. A new Teresa will
hardly have the opportunity of reforming
a conventual life any more
than a new Antigone will spend her
heroic piety in daring all for the sake
of a brother’s burial; the medium in
which their ardent deeds took shape
is for ever gone. But we insignificant
people, with our daily words and
acts, are preparing the lives of many
Dorotheas, some of which may present
a far sadder sacrifice than that
of Dorothea whose story we know.</p>

<p>“Her finely touched spirit had
still its fine issues, though they were
not widely visible. Her full nature,
like that river of which Alexander
broke the strength, spent itself in
channels which had no great name
on the earth. But the effect of her
being on those around her was incalculably
diffusive; for the growing
good of the world is partly dependent
on unhistoric acts; and that things
are not so ill with you and me as
they might have been is half owing
to the number who lived faithfully
a hidden life, and rest in unvisited
tombs.”</p>

<p>George Eliot writes too earnestly
to laugh at. Besides, she is not a Catholic&mdash;very
far from it; and therefore
her views of what a S. Teresa is
or ought to be must be radically
different from those of the church
from which S. Teresa sprang, in
which she lived, labored, became
<i>Saint</i> Teresa, and died. Were a Catholic
to have written certain portions
of the extract quoted, he would
only provoke laughter; but with this
author, the case is different.</p>

<p>It never seems to have occurred
to her that S. Teresas are not self-made;
as little as the prophets were
self-made prophets, or the apostles
self-made apostles. Neither were
they made by the society which surrounded
them. The supernatural
state of sanctity in its fulness does
not spring from humanity merely;
else might we have had eras of sanctity
as there have been other eras,
and there might be truth in George
Eliot’s words that there will be no
place for a “new Teresa.” Saints
are the very opposite to that growing
class so glibly dubbed “providential
men,” who seem to come from that
vast but rather undefined region
which goes by the name of “manifest
destiny.” The individuals forming
that happy class are set willy-nilly
by “Providence” in this world
to accomplish some destiny&mdash;a theory
laughed at long ago by one of
Mr. Disraeli’s worldly-wise characters
in the words, “We make our
fortunes, and we call them fate.”
What the saints do they do very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[779]</a></span>
consciously. Sanctity consists in not
being merely blameless in life, but in
devoting life to God, and turning
every thought, word, and action to
him for his sake. The feeling that
produces this state of life may be
influenced at the beginning by earthly
surroundings, may be shaped by
good example or wise teachings, but
is essentially independent of them.
Sanctity comes from a direct call, as
direct as the call of the apostles. It
knows neither time nor place, and
is therefore as possible in the XIXth
as in the XVIth or the Ist century.
But it is unknown outside of the
church, because the head of the
church, “Christ Jesus our Lord,”
alone has the power to call his children
to the sanctified state in this life.
And if it be asked, Why, then, does he
not call all to be saints here? it is as
though one asked, Why did he not
call all men to be apostles directly?</p>

<p>George Eliot’s difficulty springs
from not knowing precisely what
constitutes a saint.</p>

<p>If she only reads the life of S. Teresa,
she will find that the saint of her
admiration had to encounter a Middlemarch
circle even in Catholic
Spain. She will find her “young
and noble impulse struggling under
prosaic conditions”; that she had to
stand the brunt of being misunderstood
and misrepresented; her schemes
of reform, of good works, her noble
aspirations and ardent self-sacrifice,
set down as “notions.” In fact, the
opposition which meets her heroine
at every step in her desire to do
good and to be perfect, not only to
herself but to others, is puny compared
with that which S. Teresa had
to sustain all through her life.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, S. Teresa was
much more of the ordinary woman
than George Eliot, with a novelist’s
love, makes her heroine. In her
youth, she was subject to all the ordinary
fancies of “the sex,” and has
left us the record of her vanities,
which were neither more nor less
than those of ten thousand very excellent
ladies living at this moment,
who are no more S. Teresas than
they are Aspasias; but good Christian
women, girls with a happy future
before them, or smiling mothers of
families. It was not her surroundings
which made Teresa a saint: it
was her clear conception of duty,
which no “prosaic conditions” could
dim, and her profound and very definite
faith, not in that obscure creation
which George Eliot calls “the perfect
Right,” but in Jesus Christ, her
God.</p>

<p>It was perfectly natural that
George Eliot’s Teresa should fail;
but the mistake of the author consists
in making the failure come from
without rather than from within&mdash;a
mistake easily understood when it is
borne in mind that the author has
no firm faith, possibly none at all, in
Christianity. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,
all failed to make the world
better, not because they may not
have wished it, but because they had
not the power. They were themselves
uncertain of their schemes.
Their highest flights, like those of the
best of modern philosophers who possess
no faith, never pass beyond intellectual
excellence devoid of soul.
They may daze the intellect, but they
do not touch the soul; and the life of a
man is never regulated by pure intellect.
So they fail, whilst the ignorant
fishermen, who lose their personality
in God, move and convert the world.</p>

<p>In taking issue on these fundamental
points with the author of
<i>Middlemarch</i>, many of the subjects
touched upon would require elaborate
elucidation when read by those
who are not of the Catholic faith.
But space does not allow of this, and,
therefore, it is to be understood that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[780]</a></span>
this article is supposed only to meet
the eyes of persons fully acquainted
at least with the Catholic manner of
looking at things.</p>

<p>Dorothea Brooke fails in becoming
a S. Teresa, as the author seems
to consider she should have become,
not because she has lighted on evil
days and on a less congenial set
than S. Teresa did, but because, in
Catholic phrase, she had no <i>vocation</i>.</p>

<p>To find out what is meant by a
vocation, let us anticipate, and turn
a moment to <i>Fleurange</i> at that point
in the heroine’s history where, having
“tasted beforehand the bitter
pleasures of sacrifice,” she retires
heart-broken to the convent where
she spent her youth, to find the rest
and peace which seemed banished
from the world after the voluntary
sacrifice she had made of her affections.</p>

<p>“Mother Maddalena stood with
her arms folded, and listened without
interrupting her. Standing thus
motionless in this place, at this evening
hour, the noble outlines of her
countenance and the long folds of
her robe clearly defined against the
blue mountains in the distance and
the violet heavens above, she might
easily have been mistaken for one
of the visions of that country which
have been depicted for us and all
generations. The illusion would
not have been dispelled by the aspect
of her who, seated on the low
wall of the terrace, was talking with
her eyes raised, and with an expression
and attitude perfectly adapted
to one of those young saints often
represented by the inspired artist before
the divine and majestic form
of the Mother of God.</p>

<p>“‘Well, my dear mother, what do
you say?’ asked Fleurange, after
waiting a long time, and seeing the
Madre looking at her and gently
shaking her head without any other
reply.</p>

<p>“‘Before answering you,’ replied
she at last, ‘let me ask this question:
Do you think it allowable to
consecrate one’s self to God in the
religious life without a vocation?’</p>

<p>“‘Assuredly not.’</p>

<p>“‘And do you know what a vocation
is?’ said she very slowly.</p>

<p>“Fleurange hesitated. ‘I thought
I knew, but you ask in such a way
as to make me feel now I do not.’</p>

<p>“‘I am going to tell you: a vocation,’
said the Madre, as her eyes
lit up with an expression Fleurange
had never seen before&mdash;’a vocation
to the religious life is to love God
more than we love any creature in
the world, however dear; it is to be
unable to give anything or any person
on earth a love comparable to
that; to feel the tendency of all our
faculties incline us towards him
alone; finally,’ pursued she, while
her eyes seemed looking beyond the
visible heavens on which they were
fastened, ‘it is the full persuasion,
even in this life, that he is <i>all</i>, our
all, in the past, the present, and the
future; in this world and in another,
for ever, and to the exclusion
of everything besides.’”</p>

<p>The carrying out of this feeling
made Teresa a saint. It is doubtful
whether such thoughts ever entered
into George Eliot’s conception
of the character she is continually
holding up before her readers as impossible
in these days. Certainly
Dorothea Brooke, with all her natural
goodness, never conceived such
a life as that possible. The author
may be right in attributing her defects
to her Calvinistic education,
but that does not warrant the inference
that anything higher than a
life which merely aims at an uncertain
good, capable of influencing
those coming within its circle in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[781]</a></span>
certain way, is impossible in these
days. When the author speaks of
“great faith taking the aspect of illusion,”
before conceding, one would
like to see the “great faith.” Dorothea
Brooke never knew what real
faith was; from beginning to end,
all is uncertainty with her. From
girlhood up she lives in an atmosphere
of self-delusion and imagination
which can find no other possible
vent than aimless aspirations
after imaginary perfection, which
must come into collision with the
rough, practical world, and must
finally go to the wall. But when the
world sees a man or a woman acting
steadily up to a practical belief
which guides them in all their actions,
and meets every contingency, however
unexpected, and every calamity,
however great, if it does not fall in
and follow, it will at least respect it
and acknowledge that there is something
in it.</p>

<p>It may sound “a hard saying,”
but practically there is no such
thing as “ideal beauty”; and those
who, like George Eliot, strive after
it as the great good, pursue a phantom,
a nothing, an emanation of
their own imagination, and, like the
poet in Shelley’s “Alastor,” waste
their life in profitless longings, and
when death comes&mdash;</p>

<div class="limit3">
<p class="pr10 reduct p1">“All</p>
<p class="pp6">Is reft at once, when some surpassing Spirit,<br />
Whose light adorned the world around it, leaves<br />
Those who remain behind nor sobs nor groans,<br />
The passionate tumult of a clinging hope,<br />
But pale despair and cold tranquillity.”</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">Persons of an undefined faith,
women particularly, are very much
attached to this ideal beauty, and,
not finding it in man, are apt to rebel
against “prosaic conditions”; and
those who regulate their actions by
their thoughts find issue in absurdities,
often in crime, more or less
gross. It would be well for these
theorists to remember that man after
all has a considerable admixture of
clay in his composition, which may
explain many of those vulgar but
necessary “prosaic conditions”; and
until the human race comes to be
fed on “vril,” the world must continue
to count upon and accommodate
itself to a vast amount of flesh-and-blood
reality. And a beauty, far
higher than any ideal beauty, is
visible in the everlasting struggle between
spirit and clay. There was no
ideal in the death upon the cross,
the consummation of Christian sacrifice.
All was terribly real there, and
flesh suffered as well as mind while
a flutter of the spirit remained.
Here lies something greater than
any ideal&mdash;the spirit bracing the
flesh, sustaining it when it faints,
enabling it to bear all things, not
blindly and as coming by fate from
the hands of a blind destiny or careless
power, but as trials sent from
heaven to lead to heaven and prepare
for heaven.</p>

<p>That is the fault with Middlemarch.
It has all the “prosaic conditions”
and nothing else. It wants
nothing else; it positively revels in
them. And when anything higher
comes to it, it sets the higher down as
“notions” in religion, or “quackery”
in medicine, “or swallowing up” of
the little traffic by the big in railroads.</p>

<p>Into these “prosaic conditions”
and surroundings the author drops
another character similar to that of
Dorothea, as far as a man can be
similar in nature to a woman, save
that his religion consists in the passion
for his profession, the ardent aspiration
after the glory of achievement,
aided by all natural gifts,
and strengthened by what have been
well called the “pagan virtues.”
This is Lydgate, the young physician,
a stranger to Middlemarch,
who is possessed by the desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[782]</a></span>
common to all young ambition of
educating Middlemarch up to a lofty
standard, and using it as a lever to
move a slow world. Though perhaps
as well fitted as man&mdash;considered
merely as an intellectual animal
endowed with Christian instincts,
moved by a generous if somewhat
impetuous nature, and void of the
vices&mdash;could be for that purpose, the
result in his case is the same as in
that of Dorothea. Instead of lifting
Middlemarch up to the level of
his ideal, he finds himself dragged
down to it; and, strangely and perhaps
truthfully enough, he finds, in
common with Dorothea, that the
very being to whom he linked his
life is the stumbling-block in the
way of his achievement. Dorothea
receives a fatal jar to her imaginings
in the person of the husband she
adored by anticipation. Lydgate
finds his nature crushed and resisted
at all points by the passive resistance
of his wife. The woman is
mercifully relieved from her incubus
by death; the strong man gives way
before his “so charming wife, mild
in her temper, inflexible in her judgment,
disposed to admonish her husband,
and able to frustrate him by
stratagem.”</p>

<p>“Lydgate’s hair never became
white. He died when he was only
fifty, leaving his wife and children
provided for by a heavy insurance
on his life. He had gained an excellent
practice, ... having written a
treatise on gout&mdash;a disease which
has a good deal of wealth on its
side. His skill was relied on by
many paying patients, but he always
regarded himself as a failure: he had
not done what he once meant to
do. As the years went on, he opposed
his wife less and less, whence
Rosamond concluded that he had
learnt the value of her opinion. In
brief, Lydgate was what is called a
successful man. But he died prematurely
of diphtheria. He once
called his wife his basil-plant, and,
when she asked for an explanation,
said that <i>basil was a plant which had
flourished wonderfully on a murdered
man’s brains</i>.”</p>

<p>Such is the end of the naturally
noble man who marries fair Rosamond,
“the flower of Middlemarch.”
This fair Rosamond, like her historical
namesake, lives in a crooked
labyrinth of devious ways, where she
fetters her knight, her king, who
would fain go forth to conquer kingdoms,
and, if need be, take her with
him. But her kingdom is bounded
by her own narrow domain, and she
carries him on from labyrinth to
labyrinth, till he is lost and resigns
himself to his fate.</p>

<p>When the lady who is pleased to
assume the name of George Eliot
first startled the English reading
world, there was great doubt as to
the sex of the new author. Certainly
all such doubt, if any still existed,
would be set at rest for ever by the
portrait of Rosamond Vincy. No
man could ever have executed that.
No man could ever have gone down
into the very fibres of a woman’s
nature, and drawn them all out one
by one, and laid them bare before
us, to show what constitutes “that
best marble of which goddesses
are made.” If Dorothea, with the
strong touch of Calvinism leading
her noble nature astray, prove a failure,
what shall be said of “the flower
of Mrs. Lemon’s school, the chief
school in the county, where the
teaching included all that was demanded
in the accomplished female&mdash;even
to extras, such as the getting in
and out of the carriage”?</p>

<p>Rosamond Vincy is, perhaps, the
most finished portrait ever presented
of the intelligent animal of the female
sex; clever enough to despise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[783]</a></span>
Middlemarch, not because it is low,
and mean, and sordid, but because
it is too narrow and unworthy to
hold so fair and accomplished a
specimen of humanity as Rosamond
Vincy. All young Middlemarch
breaks its heart about her. She refuses
it quietly and persistently, wins
Lydgate in spite of himself, not because
he is Lydgate, the generous,
ardent, high-souled young man, but
because he brings with him the
atmosphere of an outer world, with
a hint of great relations, a distinguished
person, and an unconscious
air of superiority which Middlemarch
cannot offer. The result of the
wedding of two such natures may be
imagined. George Eliot’s version of
it is horribly real and miserably natural;
and perhaps the most powerful
part of the book is the struggle
going on between the generous nature
of the man and the demon of
self incarnate in the perfect form and
the narrow but acute intellect of the
woman, who is so supremely selfish
that she is absolutely unconscious
of her selfishness, and therefore incurable.
“Lydgate,” after vainly endeavoring
to break down this barrier
which lay between them, invisible
to the eyes of her who raised it,
“had accepted his narrowed lot with
sad resignation. He had chosen
this fragile creature, and had taken
the burden of her life upon his arms.
He must walk as he could, carrying
that burden pitifully.”</p>

<p>And she, his “bird-of-paradise,”
only once called his “basil-plant,”
when the man whose life had been
lost on her died, “married an elderly
and wealthy physician, who took
kindly to her four children. She
made a very pretty show with her
daughters, driving out in her carriage,
and often spoke of her happiness
as ‘a reward’&mdash;she did not say
for what, but probably she meant
that it was a reward for her patience
with Tertius, whose temper never became
faultless, and to the last occasionally
let slip a bitter speech which
was more memorable than the signs
he made of his repentance. Rosamond
had a placid but strong answer
to such speeches: Why, then, had he
chosen her? It was a pity he had
not had Mrs. Ladislaw&mdash;Dorothea&mdash;whom
he was always praising and
placing above her.”</p>

<p>With regret the examination into
this wonderful book, of which three
of the salient characters only have
been touched upon, must now close.
The story abounds in other characters,
each perfect in its way, as far as
drawing and execution go. It forms
quite a study in parsons as in physicians;
and those who quarrel with
the author of <i>My Clerical Friends</i>
must feel sore aggrieved at the
clerical friends of George Eliot.
There is not a <i>priestly</i> character
among them; not a single devoted
man whose heart is given wholly to
God, and whose mind is bent solely
on doing God’s work for God’s sake.
The Middlemarch parsons are a narrow
set of men of undefined belief
and cramped charity; their belief
being measured by their salary, and
their charity beginning and often
ending at home with their wives
and families. The only agreeable
characters among them as men are
Mr. Cadwallader and Mr. Farebrother.
The first of these is a “good,
easy man,” whose Gospel is as
elastic as his fishing-rod, of whom
the author says, “His conscience was
large and easy like the rest of him;
it did only what it could without any
trouble,” and whom his wife characteristically
hits off in the sentence
that, “as long as the fish rise to his
bait, everybody is what he ought to
be”; whilst she complains: “He will
even speak well of the bishop, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[784]</a></span>
I tell him it is unnatural in a beneficed
clergyman. What can one do
with a husband who attends so little
to the decencies?” The other, Mr.
Farebrother, is the best preacher in
Middlemarch, and really a man of
a noble nature; yet his poverty
leads him to play whist for money
and even an occasional game of
billiards at the Green Dragon. He
leads us to infer that he knows he
has assumed the wrong profession,
but that it is too late to get rid of
it.</p>

<p>The only man who really possesses
anything in the semblance of religion
is Mr. Bulstrode, the Methodist banker,
of whom wicked old Featherstone,
whose death is so powerfully told,
says:</p>

<p>“What’s he? He’s got no land
hereabout that ever I heard tell
of. A speckilating fellow! He may
come down any day, when the devil
leaves off backing him. And that’s
what his religion means: he wants
God A’mighty to come in. That’s
nonsense! There’s one thing I
made out pretty clear when I used
to go to church, and it’s this: God
A’mighty sticks to the land. He
promises land, and he gives land,
and he makes chaps rich with corn
and cattle.” That sounds very like
the religion of Tennyson’s Northern
Farmer of the new style. As a
matter of fact, old Featherstone
turns out to be right. Bulstrode is
a hypocrite. His life and his fortune
have been built upon hypocrisy. He
is rich on money that does not belong
to him and by wealth ill-gotten;
he strives to silence his conscience
by a life of external mortification
and by works set on foot for the
improvement of the poor and carried
out in his own way. Yet rather than
lose his character for respectability
and goodness, he murders an old
associate; that is, he consciously
does what the physician warned him
might cause death.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cadwallader, spite of her wit
and her mind, “active as phosphorus,
biting everything that came near into
the form that suited it,” must be
dismissed in her own words, though
she is the life of Middlemarch, as
one who “set a bad example&mdash;married
a poor clergyman, and
made herself a pitiable object among
the De Bracys&mdash;obliged to get her
coals by stratagem, and pray to
heaven for her salad-oil”; as must
also Ladislaw, whom Mr. Brooke,
who takes him up and transfers him
to the <i>Pioneer</i>, characterizes as “a
kind of Shelley, you know,” whom
he (Mr. Brooke) may be able to put
on the right tack; who has “a way
of putting things,” which is just the
sort of thing Mr. Brooke wants&mdash;“not
ideas, you know, but a way of
putting them.” Lydgate characterizes
him best as “a likable fellow,
but bric-a-brac.” He is just the
material out of which Charles Lever
constructed “Joe Atlee,” that prince
of Bohemians.</p>

<p>It is difficult also to pass unnoticed
by the Vincy and the Garth families;
thriftless Fred. Vincy, who is
only saved from taking to that last
resort of an ignoble mind&mdash;“the
cloth”&mdash;by honest Caleb Garth and
his merry, true-hearted daughter
Mary, who is, perhaps, after all the
best and jolliest girl in the book, and
whose plain, womanly wit and common
sense, plain and undisguised as
her open face, is an excellent foil to
the pretty animalism of Rosamond
Vincy and the vague religiousness
of Dorothea. What could be better
than this by way of preparation for
old Featherstone’s decease?&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Oh! my dear, you must do things
handsomely where there’s last illness
and a property. God knows, <i>I</i> don’t
grudge them [the relatives on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[785]</a></span>
watch] every ham in the house&mdash;<i>only
save the best for the funeral</i>.
Have some stuffed veal always, and
a fine cheese in cut. You must expect
to keep open house in these
last illnesses,’ said liberal Mrs. Vincy.”
Or than this picture of one of
George Eliot’s favorite characters?&mdash;</p>

<p>“Caleb Garth often shook his
head in meditation on the value, the
indispensable might, of that myriad-headed,
myriad-handed labor by
which the social body is fed, clothed,
and housed. It had laid hold of
his imagination in boyhood. The
echoes of the great hammer where
roof or keel were a-making, the signal-shouts
of the workmen, the roar
of the furnace, the thunder and
plash of the engine, were a sublime
music to him; the felling and lading
of timber, and the huge trunk vibrating
star-like in the distance along
the highway, the crane at work on
the wharf, the piled-up produce in
warehouses, the precision and variety
of muscular effort wherever exact
work had to be turned out&mdash;all these
sights of his youth had acted on him
as poetry without the aid of poets,
had made a philosophy for him without
the aid of philosophers, a religion
without the aid of theology. His
early ambition had been to have as
effective a share as possible in this
sublime labor, which was peculiarly
dignified by him with the name of
‘business.’”</p>

<p>After all, notwithstanding its wit
and power, and fund of worldly wisdom,
one turns almost with a sense
of relief from this disheartening
Middlemarch world to the world
as seen in <i>Fleurange</i>. Considered
merely as a story, for unity of
plot and rapidity of action, <i>Fleurange</i>
is, to our thinking, far more
interesting than <i>Middlemarch</i>. A
young girl who has been educated
in an Italian convent finds herself soon
after leaving it thrown almost entirely
upon the world by the death of
her father, an artist, to fight the battle
of life single-handed. “Young,
beautiful, poor, and alone in Paris,
what will become of her?” With this
question the book opens, and, indeed,
the whole story is plainly evolved
from this idea. Instead of wasting
her efforts on an impossible S. Teresa,
Mme. Craven takes up the practical
case of a young and religious
girl, whose training and education,
whatever they may have amounted
to in the point of accomplishments,
were built upon religion, not a vague
unreality, but a religion which in the
plainest words taught her to kneel
down and pray, not to “the perfect
Right,” as did Dorothea, but to God,
to Jesus Christ&mdash;a being, it may
here be mentioned, who is carefully
excluded from <i>Middlemarch</i>. The
reader need not infer that this inner
life of the heroine is insisted upon
severely, and that he always finds
Fleurange upon her knees. Nothing
of the sort. You only feel unconsciously,
by little touches here and
there, by the tone of the whole story,
that the girl lives up to the practical
accomplishment of what she was
taught in the convent by Madre
Maddalena; that she carries her religion
out with her into the world as
her only guide amidst its manifold
dangers; that she has not flung it
aside with her leading-strings; and
that it is this and this alone which
sustains her in the midst of terrible
suffering, and saves her from sinking
under the pressure of trial.</p>

<p>Fleurange goes first to her uncle’s
family in Germany. Their loss of
fortune drives her out again from
them into the service of a Russian
princess, where she is surrounded
and flattered by all that the world
considers witty, brave, brilliant, and
captivating. Her singular beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[786]</a></span>
and innate nobility enable her to
grace the lofty station to which
the Princess Catherine assigns her.
Here, in Florence, in the very household
of his mother, she encounters
for the second time Count George
de Walden, a handsome and highly
accomplished young gentleman, the
adoration of his mother and possibly
of himself, who is just loitering
around Europe, “seeing life.” He
met Fleurange before in her father’s
studio as she sat for a picture of
“Cordelia.” Of course, he fell in
love with her, as such young gentlemen
will do whose time is heavy on
their hands. Father and daughter
disappeared. He retained the picture,
but what he wanted was the
original; and here, after feeding on
the memory of his unknown love for
a year or so, he finds her actually
domesticated in his mother’s household.
This is what a playwright
would consider “an excellent situation,”
particularly as the princess
suspects nothing of what is passing
under her eyes. As a matter of
course, they fall in love, and, equally
as a matter of course, they contrive
to make their love known. And this
is the trying time for Fleurange.</p>

<p>It is not that she is dazzled with
the prince, but with what she considers
the perfect man. And indeed,
in the eyes of the world, Count
George is a perfect man, whilst, in
the eyes of his mother, he is something
still more; and therefore a <i>mésalliance</i>
would to her, whose heart
was entirely her son’s&mdash;all the rest of
her being divided between the <i>modiste</i>,
the physician, and the <i>salon</i>&mdash;seem
a greater crime than many of
those which bring men to the scaffold.
Fleurange knows this, and
therefore&mdash;though, when the confession
is forced from her, she does
not even to himself deny her love
for George and her desire to be his
wife&mdash;she is convinced that their
union is impossible. She does the
best thing under the circumstances:
she determines to leave the household
of the princess; and thus, not
for the first time, do the promptings
of <i>duty</i>, of what one ought to do, of
what God would have us do, correspond
with those of common sense.
George has avowed his love for
Fleurange to his mother, and the
confession has such an effect upon
her that she is cured for the time
from an attack of one of those
incurable maladies not uncommon
with ladies who are blessed with
everything that this world can offer.
There is <i>caste</i> even in illnesses, and
fashion in a complaint as in a bonnet.
Thus, when some years back
the eye-glass became a fashionable
ornament, all young England, fashionable
and would-be fashionable,
suddenly grew weak in one eye,
whilst the “sons of industry” remained
in their normal condition.</p>

<p>The princess rises to the gravity
of the situation, and extracts a promise
from her son that he will never
marry Fleurange without her consent.
But all her difficulties are
smoothed away by Fleurange herself,
who, even though the count
has asked her to be his wife, determines
to sacrifice herself for his sake,
and go.</p>

<p>“‘Fleurange,’ said the count, with
a grave accent of sincerity far more
dangerous than that of passion,
‘you shall be my wife if you will
consent to be&mdash;if you will accept
this hand I offer you.’</p>

<p>“‘With your mother’s consent?’
said Fleurange slowly, and in a
low tone. ‘Can you assure me of
that?’</p>

<p>“After a moment’s hesitation,
George replied: ‘No, not to-day;
but she will yield her consent, I
assure you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[787]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fleurange hesitated in her turn.
She knew only too well to what a
degree this hope was illusory, but
this was her last opportunity of conversing
with him. The next day
would commence their lifelong separation,
which time, distance, and
prolonged absence would continually
widen. There was no longer any
danger in telling the truth&mdash;the
truth, alas! so devoid of importance
now, but which would, perhaps, second
the duty she had to accomplish
quite as well as contradiction.</p>

<p>“‘Ah! well,’ she at last replied,
with simplicity. ‘Yes, why should
I deny it? Should life prove more
favorable to us; if by some unforeseen
circumstance, impossible to conceive,
your mother should cheerfully consent
to receive me as a daughter,
oh! then what an answer I would
make you know without my telling
you. You are likewise perfectly
aware that until that day I will never
listen to you.’</p>

<p>“‘But that day will come,’ cried
George vehemently, ‘and that
speedily.’</p>

<p>“‘Perhaps,’ said Fleurange. ‘Who
knows what time has in store for us?
And who knows that in time the obstacle
may not come from yourself?’</p>

<p>“She endeavored to say these last
words in a playful tone. They were
hardly uttered before she suddenly
stopped; but the shade of the large
cypresses that bordered the road
prevented George from seeing the
tears that inundated her face.”</p>

<p>Thus they part, under the cypresses.
George thinks she is only leaving
for a short time, to return again.
She goes back to the convent, to
bury there her broken heart and the
hopes her own strong will has blighted.
But convents are not built on
broken hearts; and Madre Maddalena,
who is none the less gifted with
common sense and worldly prudence
for leading a retired and saintly life,
sends her back into the world “to
continue the contest,” for the reasons
already given, with these words:</p>

<p>“O my poor child! it would be
much easier for me to tell you to remain
and never leave us again. It
would be sweeter for me to preserve
you thus from all the sufferings that
yet await you. But, believe me, the
day will come when you will rejoice
you were not spared these sufferings;
and you will acknowledge that she
who is now speaking to you knew
you better than you knew yourself.”</p>

<p>Fleurange goes back to the world,
to her uncle’s family, which is gradually
recovering its fall through the
efforts of Clement, her cousin, who
was the first to welcome her among
them. Notwithstanding her suffering,
she carries on all the duties of
life like a Christian woman, without
despondency as though God were
blotted out of the world, and equally
without that foolish ostentation
of gaiety sometimes assumed. She
never thought with Dorothea that
she had suffered “all the troubles of
all the people on the face of the
earth.” The hour never came to her
“in which the waves of suffering
shook her too thoroughly to leave
any power of thought”; not that she
suffered or loved less than Dorothea,
but because she saw through all
something higher than human suffering
and more lovely than human
love. That pagan hour never came
to her, when Dorothea “repeated
what the merciful eyes of solitude
have looked on for ages in the spiritual
struggles of man”; when “she
besought hardness, and coldness,
and aching weariness to bring her
relief from the mysterious incorporeal
might of her anguish”; nor did “she
lie on the bare floor and let the night
grow cold around her, while her
grand woman’s frame was shaken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[788]</a></span>
sobs as if she had been a despairing
child.” Fleurange never, as did Dorothea,
“yearned toward <i>the perfect
Right</i>, that it might make a throne
within her, and rule her errant wrong.”
Whether she yearned or not, she
knew what was right and what was
wrong, and, by praying to God for
help and strength, she did right. If
women in love stop to ask themselves
what is the “perfect right,” in
nine cases out of ten in love matters
the perfect right will be the absolute
wrong. Right is fixed; there is a
law in those things, as in all questions
of the soul, not evolved out of the
individual’s brains, but out of the
heart of Christian charity, which is
in Christ. Duty does not depend on
feeling “the largeness of the world,”
and on being “a part of that involuntary,
palpitating life,” but on being a
creation of God. George Eliot tends
to pantheism, and, spite of herself,
Christian instinct only prompts her
heroine to do what is right. If we
are “a part of that involuntary and
palpitating life,” and <i>nothing more</i>,
there is no <i>necessary</i> reason for
charity.</p>

<p>The difference between Dorothea
and Fleurange, two characters which,
allowing for side differences of clime,
are naturally similar, consists in all
the sufferings of the one bearing the
aspect of self-torture, whilst those of
the other are a sacrifice. The sorrows
of Fleurange, which, after all,
are much greater than those of
Dorothea, are endured for God’s
sake and as coming from God. They
are not a whit less painful to nature
on this account; but they are explicable,
and have a meaning which
Dorothea never seems to realize.
One suffers because she cannot help
herself; the other because it is God’s
will. On George Eliot’s principle,
there is no guarantee for a person
doing right at all, inasmuch as it is
so very difficult to determine what is
right. If right be “a part of that
involuntary and palpitating life” <i>only</i>,
it has no meaning beyond what is
contained in the word accident; that
is to say, right and wrong are effects
of circumstance. Nor is this forcing
a meaning, as may be seen from
various passages in the book&mdash;unless,
indeed, we have read them very
wrongly. Thus, she speaks of the
spirit struggling “against <i>universal
pressure</i>, which will one day be too
heavy for it, and bring the heart to
its final pause.” She sneers at our
referring a man “to the divine regard
with perfect confidence,” and says:
“Nay, it is even held sublime for our
neighbor to expect the utmost there,
however little he may have got from
us.” And in another place: “Any one
watching keenly the stealthy convergence
of human lots sees a slow
preparation of effects from one life
on another, which tells like <i>a calculated
irony</i> on the indifference or
frozen stare with which we look at
our unintroduced neighbor. Destiny
stands by sarcastic, with our <i>dramatis
personæ</i> folded in her hand.”</p>

<p>This sounds very fine, and that
last sentence might have been written
by one of the Greek poets. It is
beautifully pagan; but, after all, human
life is regulated in man and
woman by a will that is free to use
or reject the “slow preparation of
effects,” to laugh at the phantom,
destiny; and when it pleases God to
bring this lesser life of time to “a
final pause,” man goes before his
Creator to give an account of his
servitude indeed, but not of his slavery.</p>

<p>Fleurange writes from the convent
to the princess. She herself had arranged
the plot which was to blind
George to her final departure, and
this is how the princess receives the
letter of the girl who had so freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[789]</a></span>
offered up her heart on the altar of
duty. The princess knew of the
sacrifice. It is doubtful whether
Rosamond Vincy ever displayed her
unconscious selfishness so thoroughly
as this:</p>

<p>“The Princess Catherine, in an
elegant morning <i>négligé</i>, was alone
with the Marquis Adelardi in her
small <i>salon</i>, when a letter was
brought her on a silver salver. She
glanced at the address.</p>

<p>“‘Ah! from Gabrielle’ [Fleurange],
she exclaimed. ‘The very
letter I was expecting to-day.’</p>

<p>“She opened it and hastily ran over
its contents. ‘Very well done&mdash;very,’
she said. ‘Nothing could be
more natural. She hit upon the very
best thing to say.... Here, Adelardi,’
continued she, throwing him
the letter, ‘read it. It must be owned
that this Gabrielle is reliable and
true to her word. Moreover, she
has a good deal of wit.’</p>

<p>“Adelardi attentively read the
letter.</p>

<p>“‘What you have just remarked,
princess, is very true; but this time
circumstances have favored you.
This letter was not written for the
occasion; it is sincere from beginning
to end. This young girl can keep a
secret, but is incapable of prevarication.
This is not the kind of a letter
she would have written if the contents
were not absolutely true.”</p>

<p>“‘Do you think so?’ said the
princess. “It is of no consequence,
however, as to that, though it would
simplify everything still more. But
in that case&mdash;ah! <i>ciel!</i> let me look
at the letter again.’</p>

<p>“She now read it entirely through,
instead of merely glancing at the
contents.</p>

<p>“‘But in that case, I have lost my
physician, and the only one who
ever understood my case. This, <i>par
exemple!</i> is a real misfortune. If he
had had time, at least, to answer my
last letter, and tell me what springs
I should go to this year! Whom
shall I consult now? May is nearly
gone, and next month I ought to be
there. Really, I am unlucky!’</p>

<p>“‘What do you expect, princess?’
said the marquis, in a tone imperceptibly
ironical. ‘One cannot always
have good luck.’”</p>

<p>In the quiet of her German retreat,
Fleurange suddenly receives
the news that an insurrection has
broken out in Russia, in which
George is implicated. He is taken
prisoner, and only awaits in St. Petersburg
the sentence which is to
banish him to that living tomb, Siberia.
Fleurange now sees the opportunity
of uniting herself to her
lover by burying herself with him.
As his hopes in this world are for
ever blasted, she obtains the consent
of the princess to their union, and
sets out for St. Petersburg under
the guidance of her young cousin
Clement, who knows the object of
her mission. This journey and its
results complete the fourth book, entitled
“The Immolation,” and in it
the author rises to a height of power
in pathos, description, and incident
which is all the more telling that
it was altogether unsuspected: The
long ride along the dreary strand
through the day and through the
night; the crossing of the frozen river
in the darkness, with the ice cracking
ominously beneath them; the
scene where Clement and Fleurange
are left alone in the face of eternity
and immediate death, and where, for
the first and last time, when hope of
life seems banished, the confession
of his love bursts out of his young
heart to the half-conscious girl; the
last struggle to carry her safe through
on her mission of self-immolation to
the man she loves&mdash;all told in the
same simple, unpretentious style, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[790]</a></span>
with an inner force that carries the
reader along, and absorbs him as
though he were witnessing a tragedy.
The strain is sustained to the close
of the story. Amid all the fascination,
and glitter, and glare of the imperial
court of the Czar, when the
late Emperor Nicholas was in his
“golden prime,” creeps the oppressive
sense of a mute but awful terrorism
through an atmosphere of combustible
human passion all the more
dangerous for being so constrained.
The petition of Fleurange is about
to be granted; but, as it passes
through the hands of Vera, a favorite
maid of the empress, it is represented
as coming from her, between whom
and George a sort of betrothal had
taken place, and who is in love with
him. His sentence, through the instrumentality
of Fleurange, is commuted
to pardon on condition that
he should pass four years on his estates
in Livonia, and that he marry
Vera before setting out. George is
ignorant of the arrival of Fleurange,
of her petition, of her desire to bury
herself alive with him in Siberia.
Vera sees Fleurange, and implores
her to save him by the still greater
sacrifice of renouncing him for ever.
Fleurange goes back again without a
word. The man for whom she made
so many sacrifices was utterly unworthy
of her, and congratulates
himself that he escaped committing
the foolishness of marrying her,
though really in love with her for a
time. The selfishness of the mother
comes out in the son. As Fleurange
and her cousin turn homewards, they
meet the bridal party leaving the
church. Once more she seeks to
bury herself in the convent, and once
more Madre Maddalena warns her
back. She tells her that, at her first
visit, her sufferings appeared as the
expiation of an idolatry the extent
of which she did not realize; but
that something more was essential&mdash;the
shattering of the idol, though
its destruction seemed to involve the
very breaking of her own heart.</p>

<p>The shattering of Dorothea’s idol
brings a blank despair; and although
she marries Ladislaw, and is presumably
happy with him, nevertheless
she felt “that there was always
something better which she might
have done, if she had only been better
and known better.” The final
shattering of Fleurange’s idol brings
peace and opens her eyes to the
silent heroism that had stood at her
side all through, and for every pang
of hers suffered a thousand. There
is a vast amount of latent power in
this story that stands out the more
it is considered. Clement is kept in
the background through much of the
action. We only know that he loves
Fleurange, and, prominently as her
self-sacrifice is advanced, the shadow
of his always overreaches it with
the quiet that becomes a true man.
At last her eyes are opened, and she
sees, no longer Clement, “her brother,”
but Clement, the man who has
loved her all the while. The closeness
of their relationship&mdash;that of
first cousins&mdash;was almost necessary to
bring out this part of the story, their
almost continual intercourse after
their first seeing each other, without
the idea ever occurring to Fleurange
that her cousin, who was a stranger
to her up to the age of eighteen,
might possibly fall in love with her.
It is no encouragement to marriage
within the prohibited degrees to hit
upon such an incident once in a story;
as little as it is necessary to inform
the Catholic reader of what he
or she will know beforehand: that
the dispensation of the church is
necessary to the contracting such a
marriage.</p>

<p>The book, which has only been
touched upon in its leading character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[791]</a></span>
will afford an excellent foil to
<i>Middlemarch</i> in many ways. The
latter, as perhaps the very title indicates,
devotes itself chiefly to the
English <i>middle</i> class. <i>Fleurange</i>
gives pleasant glimpses of German
and Italian life with what, from intrinsic
evidence, might be judged to
be a very true picture of the Russian
court and social atmosphere.
Though there are plenty of titled
folk, it is a consolation for once to
find a princess talking like a rational
being; not always addressing her
attendant as “minion,” her butler as
“slave,” and terrifying the ears and
eyes of the groundlings by the splendor
of her cheap tragedy rhetoric,
the glory of her equipages, or the
coruscations of her diamonds. Her
son, the count, does not, as do most
of his class in the titled novel, divide
his time between the stable and the
green-room. The marquis is not “a
villain of the deepest dye,” whether
natural or artificial. Though an
Italian, he does not carry a poison
philter about with him; he employs
no bravos, he never carries off Chastity
in the shape of a milliner, to
be finally chastised by Virtue in
a smock-frock. In fact, all these
titled folk are very unlike the article
one is accustomed to find within
flaming covers. The heartlessness
and artificiality almost necessarily
evoked in the high social atmosphere
which Fleurange breathes for a time,
is none the less strikingly brought out
because it is not taken in epigrammatic
parcels, as it were, and flung
in your face, after the manner of the
author of <i>Middlemarch</i>. The lesson
of Felix Dornthall’s wicked life is
none the less impressive because,
when dying in the hospital ward,
Charity stands by his bedside and
prays for him as the ill-spent life
flickers out in the darkness. It is
no shock to human feelings to see
Fleurange in her bitter hours kneel
down and pray for help to a God
she believes can help her. If life is
not all “beer and skittles,” neither is
it all a continual mistake and a bitter
trial. If we cannot have “ideal perfection,”
it may be a consolation to
some to feel assured that we can
do very well without it, and that
there is something in the striving
after <i>real</i> perfection worthy of human
endeavor. To George Eliot, the
world was born yesterday, and only
grew with her growing faculties.
Christianity has practically gone by,
and this is not the age for its heroes
and heroines. The sham and the
cant of it only remain. As long as
the sham and the cant produce such
characters as Madre Maddalena,
Fleurange, Dr. Leblanc, and Clement,
we shall welcome the sham and
the cant in preference to the reality
which can only give us Dorothea
and Lydgate as types of true nobility
and all that the perfection of manhood
and womanhood may expect
to come to nowadays. Whilst admiring
the wit, and the worldly wisdom,
and that power which only
ripened genius can give of saying the
best thing in the best way which
<i>Middlemarch</i> displays throughout, we
confess to a little heartsickness at seeing
all the nature of a woman author
going out over Rosamond Vincy.</p>

<p><i>Fleurange</i> is certainly a relief after
the unnatural atmosphere of <i>Middlemarch</i>,
where all is false, uncertain,
cold, hard, and brilliant. Though
the story is very human, and in this
respect has not a whit less of earth
than the other, it suffers nothing by
an occasional glimpse of heaven.
Poor humanity likes a little hope,
particularly when it has a very sound
title to hope. These two authors
traverse it as a hospital; the one
surgeon-like, knife in hand, cutting
and lopping the useless and unsightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[792]</a></span>
limbs with bright, keen weapon
and merciless precision, leaving the
dead to bury their dead; the other,
like a sister of charity, to bandage
the wound, and comfort the sick, and
pray by the dying. How different
is the same scene to the eyes of each,
and how different is each in the
eyes of the sick patients! While
they admire the skill of the one, they
shudder and turn instinctively from
her; on the other streaming eyes
are bent, and troubled hearts murmur,
“God bless you!”</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE HOUSE OF YORKE.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="pc1">AN INCH OF FRINGE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Mr. Schöninger</span> had been in such
haste to keep his engagement the
evening before that he had made the
rehearsal a short one, and the company
did not remain long after he went.
Perhaps the family did not seem to
them quite so gay and pleasant as
usual. Certainly no one objected
much to their going. The only remonstrance
was that uttered by Annette,
when Lawrence Gerald took
his hat to follow the last visitor.</p>

<p>“What! are you going, too?” she
exclaimed involuntarily. She was
learning not to reproach him for
anything, but it was impossible to
conceal her disappointment.</p>

<p>He showed no impatience. On
the contrary, his voice was quiet and
even kind when he answered her.</p>

<p>“You cannot think it would be
very pleasant for me to stay this
evening,” he said. “I want to wipe
away some disagreeable impressions
before I come again. Besides, I
must finish my afternoon’s writing
to-night.”</p>

<p>She had to own that he might
well shrink from meeting her mother
again just then, particularly as the
lady did not seem to have recovered
her good-humor. In fact, while they
were standing together near the conservatory,
she crossed the front hall
from one room to another, and cast
a watchful glance back at them, as if
she would have liked to come nearer,
but hesitated to do so.</p>

<p>At sight of her, they turned away,
and went out through the garden
door at the rear of the long hall, and
came round the house instead of
going through it. This garden was
extensive, occupying nearly or quite
two acres of land, and was surrounded
by a low stone wall overgrown
in some places with vines, in others
shaded by shrubs or trees. Crichton
was so well governed that high walls
were not necessary to protect the
gardens, especially when people were
so well known to be perfectly willing
and able to protect their rights as
the Ferriers. A few notable examples,
made in a very spirited manner
at the beginning of their residence,
had inspired transgressors with a
wholesome awe of them and their
premises. Not a flower was broken,
not a cherry nor a plum disappeared
from their trees, not an intruding
footstep printed their walks.</p>

<p>These grounds were now sweet
with a profusion of June roses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[793]</a></span>
so pink that, as Annette walked
through them with her lover, they
appeared to be flushed with sunset,
though sunset had quite faded, leaving
only a pure twilight behind.
Besides the newly planted trees,
which were small, a few large maples
had been left from the original forest,
and shaded here and there a circle
of velvet sward. A superb border
of blue flower-de-luce enclosed the
whole with its band of fragrant sapphire.</p>

<p>The two walked slowly round the
house without speaking, and Lawrence
stepped through the gate, then,
turning, leaned on it. Once out of
Mrs. Ferrier’s presence, he was not in
such haste to go. Two linden-trees
in bloom screened them from observation
as they stood there; and, since
pride no longer compelled him to
keep up an indifferent or a defiant
manner, the young man yielded to
his mood. He was sad, and seemed
to feel even a sort of despair. In a
weak way he had admired all that
was admirable, and despised all
that was ignoble, yet he had lacked
the resolution necessary to secure his
own approval. He was still noble
enough to feel the loss of that more
bitterly than any outside condemnation.
When he could, he deceived
himself, and excused his own shortcomings;
but when some outward attack
tore aside the flimsy veil, and
showed him how he might be criticised,
or when some stirring appeal
revived the half-smothered ideal within
him, then he needed all the soothing
that friendship or flattery could
bestow. While listening to Mrs.
Ferrier that afternoon, he had not
been able to exclude the humiliating
conviction that he had himself forged
the chains that held him in that ignoble
dependence, and that ten years
of earnest endeavor would have set
him in a position to command the
fulfilment of his wishes. But now,
he assured himself, it was too late
to begin. His earliest foe, his own
nature, had allied itself with one
scarcely less strong, a pernicious
habit, and it was now two to one.
He must be helped, must go on with
this engagement, and patch up the
life which he could not renew.</p>

<p>“If she would give up the point
of our living with her, all would be
well,” he said presently. “Why
couldn’t we board at the Crichton
House? I don’t mean to be idle, and
don’t wish to be. I wouldn’t make
any promises to her, Annette, and I
won’t make them to any one who
threatens me; but I am willing to
tell you that I really mean to try.
All I want is to get out of my little
way of living, and have a fair start.
You know I never had a chance.”</p>

<p>His lip and voice were unsteady,
and, as he looked up appealingly
into her face, she saw that his eyes
were full of tears. A grief and self-pity
too great for words possessed
him. That element of childlike tenderness
and dependence which survives
the time of childhood in some
men, as well as in most women, made
him long for the pity and sympathy
of one to whom he had never given
either sympathy or pity.</p>

<p>Annette, woman-like, found no
fault, or at least expressed none.
It was enough if he needed her sympathy.
She had thought that he
only needed her wealth. Her heart
ached with pity for him, and swelled
with indignation against all who
would censure him. His foes were
her foes.</p>

<p>“I know you never had a chance,
Lawrence,” she said fervently; “but
never mind that now. You shall
have one. F. Chevreuse shall talk
to mamma, and make her give me at
once what I am to have. It is my
right. Don’t be unhappy about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[794]</a></span>
past, nor blame yourself in anything.
All lives are not to follow one plan.
Why should you have begun as a
drudge, and spent all these years in
laying up a little money? What
better would you be now for having
the experience of an errand-boy and
a clerk, and for the memory of a
thousand mortifications and self-denials?
You might have two or three
thousand dollars capital, and be, at
best, a junior partner in some paltry
firm, which I should insist on your
leaving. Is that so much to regret?”</p>

<p>He smiled faintly, and, his cause
being so well defended, ventured to
attack it. “To be mortified is not
necessarily to be degraded,” he said.
“I shouldn’t have been obliged to
listen to the lecture I heard this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“The degradation of that rests
with me!” she exclaimed hastily,
with a painful blush on her face.
“I do not like to think nor speak of
it, and I wish you would try to forget
it. The time is come for me to
tell mamma that I am not a child.
Leave all to me. I never fail when
I am roused, and I promise you,
Lawrence, you shall not bear more
than one other insult for my sake.
And for the past, I charge you again,
do not suffer any one to dictate to
you what you should have done.
Let them correct themselves, which
will, perhaps, be sufficient to employ
their time.”</p>

<p>She could see he was cheered, not
much, but a little. He tossed his
head back, and glanced about with
an air of renewed courage and determination.
But no thought for the
heart that he had burdened with his
pain and care entered his mind.
She had given her help eagerly, glad
to give, and he accepted it as a matter
of course, and, having got what
he wanted, went away with a careless
good-night.</p>

<p>Annette went into the house, and
soon the doors were locked. Mrs.
Ferrier always went to bed early, and
the servants usually followed her example.</p>

<p>Annette leaned from her window,
and counted the city lights going
out, and the noises sinking into silence.
As it grew later, the sound
of the Cocheco became fitfully audible,
borne on the cool northwestern
breeze, and presently grew steadier,
till only one other sound, the pulse
of a far-away steam-mill, was heard
tossing on that spray-like murmur
like a little ball on the water-column
of a fountain.</p>

<p>Cool as it was, the room seemed
close to her. She was restless, too,
yet could not move about without
being heard by her mother. So she
opened her door, and crept softly
down-stairs. The long drawing-room
windows looking into the conservatory
had been left open, and
some of the sashes in the conservatory
were still lowered from the top.
A light and fragrant breeze came
through, bringing a sound of rustling
leaves. She stepped over the sill,
and threw herself down on a sofa
just outside. The large space was a
relief from that cramped feeling that
had brought her down-stairs. Besides,
there was only glass between
her and all out-doors. She saw the
star-lighted skies, those languid stars
of summer, soft as humid eyes, and
the dark trees of the garden, and the
faint outline of hills against the near
southwestern horizon. The flowering
plants showed like black shadows
lurking about the bases of the
pillars, and the pillars themselves appeared
to stretch upward to the sky,
and curl over in capitals of purple
acanthus-leaves fringed with stars.</p>

<p>Annette rested her head on the
sofa-cushions. The space and motion
outside and the waving boughs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[795]</a></span>
vines had a quieting effect; yet she
was in that state of feverish wakefulness
wherein one can be quiet only
in a position from which it is possible
to start at any moment.</p>

<p>Her life was changing in its hopes
and aims, and she was in all the
tumult of that revolution. The vague,
sweet expectations and rosy hopes
which are planted in the heart of
every female infant, which spring up
and bud in the maiden’s soul, which
blossom or are nipped in the woman’s,
as God shall will, were withered in
hers, had withered long ago, and she
was only now owning it to herself.
There was to be no tender homage
and care for her. No one was to
take delight in her, to seek her for
herself, to think anxiously lest she
be grieved or hurt. Whatever pain
might come to her in life, she must
bear it in silence. To tell it where
alone sympathy would be precious
and helpful to her would be to bore
her listener. Hers was the part to
give, not to receive. Without a
man’s strength and hardness, she was
to take the man’s portion, support,
cheer, encourage, and defend, and
all without thanks.</p>

<p>An awful sense of isolation seized
upon her. There had come to her
that moment which comes to some,
perhaps to most people, once in a
life, when all the universe seems to
withdraw, and the soul hangs desolate
in the midst of space, the whole
of creation alien. One shrinks from
life then, and would gladly hide in
death.</p>

<p>Annette was too sad and weary to
cry out. She lay quiet, and looked
at the tree-shadows. Some good
thought crossed her mind, a whisper
of her guardian angel, or an inspiration
of the Comforter&mdash;“Fall down
and pray to God for help!” it said;
but found her insensible. A human
love inexpressibly bitter and engrossing
blunted her heart to all else. She
mutely asked God to be merciful to
her, but formed no other petition.</p>

<p>While she gazed without abstractedly,
only half conscious of what she
saw, a darker shadow appeared
under a tree just visible past the
angle of the house. What seemed to
be a man’s form leaned forward partially
into her view, drew something
from a garden-chair under the tree,
then disappeared. She was too
much occupied by her own thoughts
to be alarmed, and, moreover, was
not in any danger. She only wondered
a little what it might mean,
and presently understood. Mr.
Schöninger, coming from a long
drive that afternoon, had brought a
shawl over his arm, and she had noticed
after he went away that it had
been forgotten on the garden-chair
where he had thrown it on entering.
It might be that, returning home
now, he had recollected, and come
into the garden for it.</p>

<p>Slight as the incident was, it broke
the train of her painful thoughts.
She sat up with a gesture that flung
the past with all its beautiful hopes
and wishes behind her, and welcomed
the one thought that came in their
stead, sad yet sweet, like a smile
half quenched in tears. Lawrence
Gerald did not love her, but he needed
her, and she took up her cross,
this time with an upward glance.</p>

<p>When we have set self aside, from
whatever motive, the appeal to God
for help is instinctive, and seems less
a call than the answer to a call.
As though Infinite Love, which for
love’s sake sacrificed a God, could
not see a trembling human soul binding
itself for the altar without claiming
kindred with it. “My child, the
spark that lights thy pyre is from my
heart. Hold by me, and it shall not
burn in vain.”</p>

<p>Yet that the happiness of giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[796]</a></span>
love and help is nobler and more
elevating than the pleasure of receiving
them Annette did not then realize,
perhaps would not have believed.
Who does believe it, or, at
least, who acts upon the belief till
after long and severe discipline, till
the world has lost its hold on the
heart, and it has placed all its hopes
in the future? Fine sentiments drop
easily from the lips of those to whom
they cost nothing, or who have forgotten
the struggles by which their
own peace was won. Those who
are fed can talk eloquently of patience
under starvation, and those
who are warmed can cry out on the
folly of the poor traveller who sinks
to sleep under the snowdrift. Verily,
preaching is easy, and there is no
one who has such breath to utter
heroic sentiments as he who never
puts them in practice.</p>

<p>As Annette lay there, growing
quieter now that all was settled, clouds
came up from behind the hills, and
slowly extinguished the stars. Opaline
lightnings quivered and expanded
inside those heavy mists without
piercing them, as though some winged
creature of fire were imprisoned
there, and fluttering to escape; and
every time the air grew luminous, the
azaleas and rhododendrons bloomed
rose-red out of their shadows.
Deep and mellow thunders rolled
incessantly, and a thick rain came
down in drops so fine that the sound
of their falling was but a whisper.
It was a thunder-storm played <i>piano</i>.
Annette was lulled to a light sleep,
through which she still heard the
storm, as in a dream, growing softer
till it ceased. And no sooner did
she dream it had ceased than she
dreamed it had recommenced, with
a clamor of rain and thunder, and a
wind that shook the doors and windows,
and a flash like a shriek that
syllabled her name.</p>

<p>She started up in affright. The
sky was clear and calm, and the
storm had all passed by; but the
wet trees in the garden shone with a
red light from the windows, and
there was noise and a hurrying to
and fro in the house, and her mother
was calling her with hysterical cries.</p>

<p>Annette would have answered,
but her tongue was paralyzed with
that sudden fear. She could only
hasten into the house with what
speed the deathly sickness of such an
awakening allowed her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrier was walking through
the rooms, wringing her hands, and
calling for her daughter. “Where
is Annette? What has become of
Annette?” The servants stood
about, silent and confounded by the
noisy grief of their mistress, unable
to do anything but stare at her.</p>

<p>There is usually but one chief
mourner on such occasions, however
many candidates there may be for
the office. The one who first raises
the voice of lamentation leaves the
others <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>In one of her turns, Mrs. Ferrier
saw Annette leaning pale and mute
on a chair near by.</p>

<p>“O Annette, Annette! do you
know what has happened? Oh!
what shall I do?” she cried.</p>

<p>Annette could only cling to the
chair for support. Her mouth and
throat were too dry for speech.</p>

<p>“Somebody has killed Mother
Chevreuse!” The girl slipped down
to her knees, and hid her face a
moment. Nothing had happened
to Lawrence, thank God! Then
she stood up, shocked and grieved
indeed, but no longer powerless.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me what it is,
John?” she asked, turning to the
man. “Tell me all you know about
it.”</p>

<p>Her mother’s noise and volubility
were too irritating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[797]</a></span></p>

<p>John’s story was soon told. Lawrence
Gerald, having been awakened
by a messenger from the priest’s
house, had been up there to call
them before going for F. Chevreuse.
He wished some of them to come
down immediately.</p>

<p>Annette’s mind was clear and
prompt in any emergency which did
not touch her too nearly. She saw
at once all that was necessary to be
done.</p>

<p>“Ma, please don’t take all the attention
to yourself,” she said rather
impatiently. “It isn’t you who are
killed. Try to think of what should
be done. John, you and Bettie
will go down with me. The rest of
you lock the house securely, and let
no one in whom you don’t know.
Louis and Jack will take care of
you.”</p>

<p>Bettie flew with alacrity to prepare
herself, willing to brave all perils in
the company of John; but, coming
down again, found that her mistress
was also going. There was no help
for it. The servant-maid fell humbly
into the rear, while Mrs. Ferrier
clung to the arm of the footman,
and saw an assassin in every shadow.
At sight of a man hurrying up the
hill toward them, she cried out, and
would have fled if her daughter had
not held her.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, ma! it’s Lawrence,”
Annette said, and went to meet the
breathless messenger.</p>

<p>“I’m going after F. Chevreuse,”
he explained. “Can I have one of
your horses?”</p>

<p>He stopped only for Annette’s reply:
“Take anything you want!”
then hurried on up the hill.</p>

<p>The little cottage by the church
was all alight, and people were
hurrying about, and standing in the
open door and the entry.</p>

<p>“Now, recollect, ma, you must
keep quiet, and not get in anybody’s
way,” was the daughter’s last charge
as they drew near; then they went
into the house.</p>

<p>Honora Pembroke met Annette at
the door of the inner room. The
two girls clasped hands in silence.
They understood each other. The
one was strong to endure with calmness,
the other strong to do with
calmness; and, till F. Chevreuse
should come, all rested on them. Mrs.
Gerald, weaker of nerve, could only
sit and gaze about her, and do what
she was told to do. Jane was in the
hands of officers, who were trying to
find out what she knew, and prevent
her saying too much to others. It
was not an easy task; for what the
woman knew and what she suspected
were mingled in inextricable confusion,
and the only relief her excitement
could find was in pouring out
the whole to whoever would listen.
An argument was, however, found to
silence her.</p>

<p>“You will help the rogue to escape
if you tell one word,” the detective
said. “If you want him to
be punished, you must hold your
tongue. Have you told any one?”</p>

<p>“Nobody but Lawrence Gerald,”
Jane answered, recovering her self-control.
It would be hard to keep
silence, but she could do it for the
sake of punishing <i>that man</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, say nothing to any one else.
Look now, and remember how it
looks, then forget all about it till you
are asked in court.”</p>

<p>Jane and the two policemen in the
little room with them drew nearer
and scrutinized closely the contents
of a slip of paper that the detective
held in his hand. It was an inch or
so of grey worsted fringe torn from
a shawl; and, clinging to the fragment,
a single human hair, of a peculiar
light-brown shade.</p>

<p>Poor Mother Chevreuse! This
little clue had been found clenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[798]</a></span>
in her stiffening fingers when they
took her up.</p>

<p>The three looked intently, then
drew back, and the detective carefully
folded the paper again, and
placed it in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>An hour later, F. Chevreuse arrived.
We will not enter the house
with him. The two guests that there
await him, death and an unspeakable
grief, demand that homage of us,
that we do not intrude.</p>

<p>As Lawrence Gerald was driving
away from the door after having
brought the priest, Jane called out
to him, and, when he stopped, leaned
over the wheel into the carriage.</p>

<p>“Don’t let a soul on earth know
what I told you we found in her
hand, nor what I saw,” she whispered.</p>

<p>He muttered some half-stifled
word about not being a tattler.</p>

<p>“Promise me you won’t,” she persisted,
laying her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>He gave the promise impatiently&mdash;women’s
ways are so annoying when
one is excited and in haste&mdash;shook
her hand off, and drove away.</p>

<p>Let us pass over the first days that
followed. The gossip, the wonderment,
the show of grief that is merely
excitement, and, still more, the
grief that is real, and shrinks from
showing itself&mdash;who would not wish
to escape sight and sound of them?
We may well believe that one so
beloved and honored was followed
to her last home by the tears and
blessings of a crowd, and that one
so bereaved was the object of an
immense sympathy and affection.
We may also be sure that those to
whom the law gives in charge the
search for such offenders did not
neglect their task. We will not
fraternize with the detectives nor
with the gossips. Let them do their
work, each after his kind.</p>

<p>When weeks had passed away,
Mrs. Gerald had not yet dared to
mention his loss to F. Chevreuse;
but he spoke of it to her; and, having
once spoken, she felt sure that he
wished the subject to be avoided
thereafter.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that I never was
a real priest till now,” he said. “I
was not conscious of making any
sacrifice. I had a pleasant home,
and one there to whom I was all in
all. Now I have no earthly tie,
nothing to come between me and my
Master’s work. I don’t mean to say
that she was an obstacle; on the
contrary, she was a great help; but
she was also an immense comfort,
more a comfort than I deserve, perhaps.
I do not deny that it is sad,
but I know also that it is well.
There are no accidents in God’s
providence. The only thought almost
too hard for me to bear is that
I took her affection so carelessly.
She gave her all, and I did not remember
to tell her that it was precious
to me. She was a tender,
loving creature, and, when I was a
child, she gave me that fondness that
children need. I forgot that she
might need fondness as much when
she grew old. I forgot that, while I
had a thousand duties, and interests,
and friends, she had nothing but me.</p>

<p>“It is too late to talk of it now;
but if I could have been permitted
one minute to go on my knees to
her, and bless and thank her for all
her love, I could bear this better.
For that man, whoever he may be,
I have no feeling but pity. Unless
the safety of others should require
it, I hope he may not be taken.
I haven’t a doubt the unfortunate
wretch wanted the money, but didn’t
mean to hurt any one, except in self-defence.
I do not wish to know
who he is.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald was too much affected
to utter a word in reply. It did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[799]</a></span>
not seem to be F. Chevreuse who
was speaking to her in that sad
voice, from which the ringing tone
had quite gone, and that pale face
was not like his. It seemed, too,
that in those few weeks his hair had
grown white.</p>

<p>He resumed after a moment:
“There are some things at the house
I would like to have you see to.
Whatever is valuable in money, the
silver and a few other things, I
mean shall go toward a new altar-service.
She wished it. But there
are some trinkets and things that
she used, and clothing and books,
that I would like to have you take
away. I don’t want to see them
about. Let Honora choose whatever
she likes for herself. My mother
was fond of her. Keep what you
wish, and give some little <i>souvenirs</i>
to those who would value them for
her sake. And now let us set our
faces forward, and waste no time in
vain lamentations.”</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Gerald!” Jane cried,
when the lady went there in compliance
with the priest’s request,
“my heart is broke! All the light
is gone out of the house.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of that,” Mrs. Gerald
said. “Tell me of F. Chevreuse.
Is he quiet? Does he eat
anything?”</p>

<p>“He eats about as much as would
keep a fly,” the housekeeper sighed.
“But he sits at the table, and tries
the best he can. If you’d seen him
the first night after it was all over!
I came up and poured the tea out
for him, and, indeed, my eyes were
so full I came near scalding myself
with it. He took something on
his plate, and made believe taste of
it, and talked in a cheerful sort of
way about the weather and about
something he wanted to have done.
But when he saw my hand holding
the cup out to him, he stopped short
in what he was saying, and choked
up, and then he leaned back in his
chair and burst out a-crying. It
was the same little cup and spoon
she always gave him, but it wasn’t the
same woman that held it across the
table for him to take. And I set
the cup down and cried too: what
else? And, ‘Jane,’ says he, ‘where’s
the little hand that for years has
been stretched out to me every evening?’
What could the like of me
say, ma’am, to comfort a priest in
his sorrow? I couldn’t help speaking,
though, and says I, ‘May be
there isn’t the length of the table
between you,’ says I, ‘and the little
hand is holding out the first bitter
cup it ever offered you to drink. But,
oh! drink it, father dear,’ says I,
‘and may be you’ll find a blessing at
the bottom.’ And then I was so
ashamed of myself for preaching
to the priest that I ran out of the
room. After a little while his bell
rang, and I wiped my eyes, and
went in. And there he sat with a
trembling kind of a smile on his face,
and says he, ‘Jane, how am I to get
my tea at all?’ So I gave him the
cup, and went and stood by the fireplace.
And he talked about things
in the house, and asked me if I
didn’t want my mother to come and
live with me. The Lord knows I
didn’t, ma’am, through my mother
not being overneat, besides taking
a drop now and then. But it’s decenter,
and so I said yes. And
when I was cheered up a little, he
sent me out. But when I was going
through the door, he spoke to me,
and says he, ‘Jane!’ And when I
looked back, and said ‘Sir!’ says he,
‘Jane, you’re right. There is a blessing
at the bottom of it.’ And he
smiled in a way that was sadder
than tears. Since that he has the
tray set at his elbow, and pours the
tea for himself. And now, ma’am,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">[800]</a></span>
I’m going to tell you something that
you mustn’t let anybody know, for
may be I oughtn’t to speak of it.
That first night following the funeral
I heard him walking about his
room after I went to bed, and I
knew he couldn’t sleep; though,
indeed, it was little that any of us
slept that night. Well, by-and-by,
when I’d been drowsy like, I heard
him go out into the entry, and I
thought that perhaps some one had
rung the bell. I was frightened for
fear of who it might be; so I got
up, and threw something on, and
crept up the stairs, and peeped
through the rail, all ready to scream
for help. I watched him open the
door, with the street-lamp shining
not far off; and, O Mrs. Gerald!
if he didn’t kneel down there and
kiss the threshold where she stood
that night watching him drive away;
and he cried that pitiful that it was
all I could do not to cry out loud
myself, and let him know I was
there.”</p>

<p>The first sharpness of the impression
made by this event wore away,
and people began to talk of other
things. Some wealthy Protestants
of Crichton made up for F. Chevreuse
the money he had lost, and
thus soothed their regret for the loss
which they could not repair to him.
Even those who were most grieved
felt their lives closing over the
wound. Duties and plans that had
been interrupted were resumed,
among them that for a concert in aid
of the new convent. Miss Ferrier’s
rehearsal had been a last preparation
for this concert, which had been
postponed on account of the death
of Mother Chevreuse, and it was
necessary to have another.</p>

<p>Annette threw herself into these
preparations with spirit. Her affairs
were prospering as well as she could
expect. F. Chevreuse had talked
with Mrs. Ferrier, and brought her
to reason, and Lawrence had been
induced to yield a little. It was settled
that the marriage should take
place on the first of September, and
the young couple spend one year
with the mother. After that they
were to be free to go where they
liked, Annette with an ample allowance
assured her, and a promise that
the property should be equally divided
in case of her mother’s death.</p>

<p>“The young man is behaving very
well,” F. Chevreuse said, “and he
ought to be trusted and encouraged.
He goes regularly to Mass, and attends
closely to his business. I shall
not soon forget how much he did for
me when&mdash;when I was away that
night. The shock seems to have
awakened him. He sees what indolence
and unfixed principles may
lead to, and that a man who rocks
like a boat on the tide of his own
passions may drift anywhere. We
must be good to him.”</p>

<p>“If you would only give him a
plain talking to, father,” Mrs. Ferrier
said. She had an immense faith
in the power of talk. “If you would
tell him what he ought to do, and
what he ought not to do. Just warn
him.”</p>

<p>The priest shook his head.</p>

<p>“I believe in sometimes leaving
God to warn in his own way,” he
said. “It is a mistake for even the
wisest man to be perpetually thrusting
his clumsy fingers into the delicate
workings of the human soul.
We are priests, but we are not Gods;
and men and women are not fools.
They should be left to themselves
sometimes. God has occasional messages
for his children which do not
need our intervention. Too much
direction is degrading to an intelligent
soul.”</p>

<p>F. Chevreuse had been involuntarily
expressing the thought that started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[801]</a></span>
up in his own mind rather than
addressing his companion; and, seeing
at a glance that she had not understood
a word of what he had been
saying, he smilingly adapted his talk
to her comprehension.</p>

<p>“I heard a story once,” he said,
“of a careful mother who was going
away from home to spend the
day. Before starting, she called her
children about her, and, after telling
them of certain things which they
were not to do, she concluded in this
wise: ‘And don’t you go up into the
back attic, to the dark corner behind
the big chimney, and take up a loose
board in the floor, and pull out a
bag of dry beans there is there, and
get beans in your noses.’ Then she
went away, having forbidden every
evil which she could imagine might
happen to them. When she came
home at night, every child had a
bean up its nose. Don’t you see
she had better not have said anything
about those beans? The children
didn’t know where they were.
No; if you want to keep any one
from evil, talk to him of what is
good. The more you look at evil,
even to abuse it, the less shocking it
is to you. The more you talk about
it, the more people will do it.
Sometimes it must be spoken of; but
beware of saying too much. Do
you know when darkness appears
darkest? When you have been
looking at light. Therefore, my
lady, say all that is pleasant to this
young man, and try to forget that
there ever was anything unpleasant.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrier was not one to oppose
the earnestly expressed wish of a
clergyman, and, at this time, all F.
Chevreuse’s people felt an unusual
desire to show him their love and
obedience. Besides, she was rather
proud of having been considered so
implacable that no one but a priest
could influence her, and of being
able to say, in defence of her change
of plan: “I did it for the sake of
F. Chevreuse.” She even boasted a
little of this intercession, and took
care it should be known that the
church had begged her to be lenient,
and had for a moment anxiously
awaited her decision.</p>

<p>“Besides,” she would add, “he
takes a good deal more pains to be
pleasant now.”</p>

<p>Lawrence, indeed, took no such
pains, and, perhaps, liked Annette’s
mother less than ever. The only
change was in herself. She had, by
being civil to him, rendered it possible
for him to be agreeable. When
he was spoken of slightingly, she had
insulted him; when he was praised
to her, she conciliated. It was not
necessary that there should be any
change in him.</p>

<p>Annette, too, had taken his cause
up with a high hand. The passion
of love, which had sometimes made
her timid in speaking of him, was
unconsciously giving place to a passion
of pity, which made her fearless.
Woe to the servant who was dilatory
in waiting on Mr. Gerald, or
lacking in any sign of respect for
him. He was consulted about everything.
Not a curtain, nor chair, nor
spoon could be bought till he had
approved. A cool “I will see what
Lawrence thinks of it,” was enough
to postpone a decision on any subject.
“He has taste, and we have
nothing but money.” If the phrase
is not a contradiction, it might be
said that she abased herself haughtily
in order to exalt him. If they
had company to dinner, Lawrence
must glance over the list of dishes;
if a new plant arrived, he must advise
where it should be set; if a
stranger came to town, it was for
Lawrence to decide whether the Ferriers
should show him hospitality.</p>

<p>“I think our rehearsal may as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[802]</a></span>
be also a little garden-party,” Annette
said to him. “We need scarcely
any practice, nothing to speak of,
everything went so well the last
time.”</p>

<p>She was tying on her bonnet before
a mirror in the drawing room,
and Lawrence stood by a window,
hat in hand, looking out at the carriage
waiting at the gate. He did
not seem to have heard her.</p>

<p>“I should only ask a few persons
who will be sure to go to the concert
and help along,” she continued, twirling
lightly about to see if the voluminous
folds of her black silk train fell
properly. She wanted Lawrence to
notice her, for she was looking uncommonly
well. Black was becoming
to her; and the delicate lavender
gloves, and bunch of scarlet geranium-flowers
half lost in lace just
behind her left ear, gave precisely the
touch of color that was needed. But
he stood immovable, watching the
horses, perhaps, or watching nothing.</p>

<p>Seeing him so abstracted, she
looked at him a moment, remembering
an old story she had read of
Apollo apprenticed to a swine-herd.
Here was one, she thought, who
might have graced Olympus, yet who
had been bound down to poverty,
and labor, and disappointment. His
pale and melancholy face showed
that he might be mourning even now
his ignominious captivity. Thank
God, she could help him! He should
not always be so sorrowful.</p>

<p>He moved slightly, without looking
toward her, aware of her silence,
though he had not noticed her
speech. She checked, with an effort,
the impulse to go to him with some
affectionate inquiry, and went on
with what she had been saying.
“We need the editors, of course, and
I can ask Dr. Porson to bring Mr.
Sales. They say he is very clever,
and will bring <i>The Aurora</i> up again.
They will give us puffs, you know.
If I send the doctor a note this
afternoon, he will tell Mr. Sales this
evening, and he can write a nice
little report of the rehearsal before
he comes to it, and have it out to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” asked Lawrence,
turning round from the window.</p>

<p>“All but this.” She gave him a
little gold glove-buttoner; and held
out her hand.</p>

<p>“By the way,” she said suddenly,
“have you heard the story about
Mr. Schöninger?”</p>

<p>Lawrence let slip the tiny button
he had just caught, and stared at her
in silence. Perhaps he remembered
something that Jane, the priest’s
housekeeper, had charged him not
to tell.</p>

<p>“Such a romantic story!” she said,
smiling at having won his attention.
“I forgot to tell you. They
say that he has a lawsuit going on in
England about an immense property
to which he is the rightful heir. It
is from some very distant relative
who left Germany for England a
hundred years ago. He has no personal
acquaintance with any of the
family there now; but ten years ago,
he learned that the heirs had died out
leaving him nearest to the estate.
He was then in Germany, and had a
little property, on which he lived like
a gentleman. He spent every dollar
he had in the effort to obtain his
rights, but did not succeed. Neither
did he fail; but more money was
needed. And that’s the reason why
he came to this country and became
a music-teacher, and why he lives so
plainly, and works all the time. Lily
Carthusen told me she heard that he
sent money to England every quarter,
and that all his earnings go into that
lawsuit.”</p>

<p>“Lily Carthusen knows a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[803]</a></span>
deal about other people’s business,”
the young man remarked ungraciously.
“She is one of the kind who
peep into letters and listen at doors.
I wouldn’t repeat any of her stories,
Annette.”</p>

<p>“I only tell you, Lawrence,” she
replied humbly.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe a word of
it,” he said. “Schöninger is a fine
fellow; and people imagine there is
some mystery about him, simply because
he won’t tell everybody his
business, and who his grandfather
and grandmother were. There are
thousands of persons in this city who,
if you should keep one room in your
house locked, would believe that it
was full of stolen goods.”</p>

<p>They were going out through the
door now, and Annette assumed a
bright smile. No one must see her
looking mortified or sad, least of all
when she was with Lawrence. She
stepped lightly into the carriage, and
gave her order with the air of one
anticipating a charming drive. “To
the convent, Jack, straight through
the town, and slowly.”</p>

<p>Which meant that they intended
to have some conversation, and were
not unwilling to be observed.</p>

<p>“I always like to see the sisters
when I am out of tune,” Miss Ferrier
said. “They are so soothing and
cheerful. Besides, they are brave.
They fear nothing. They are not
always quaking, as people in the
world are. They have the courage
of children who know that they will
be taken care of. I always feel
stronger after being with them. Not
that I am usually timid, though. I
think I have more courage than you,
Lawrence.”</p>

<p>She smiled playfully, giving her
true words the air of a jest.</p>

<p>He looked straight ahead, and ignored
the jest. “You have a clear
conscience, that is the reason,” he
replied. “It’s the old serpent in the
tree that makes it shaky.”</p>

<p>“It is very true,” she said calmly,
after a moment’s consideration. “I
do not believe I ever did anything
wicked.”</p>

<p>“As a rule, I don’t like religious
people,” the young man observed;
“but I’ve no objection to any of the
nuns. The fact that they will wear
unbecoming dresses and cut off their
hair proves them sincere. It’s the
strongest proof a good-looking woman
could give. You needn’t laugh,
Annette. Just think a minute, and
you’ll find it is so. Now, look at
that little Anita I saw up there once.
She’s as pink and white as the inside
of a sea-shell, and her hair must be
a yard long, and beautiful hair at
that. Yet she is going to have those
braids cut off, and hide her face
under a black bonnet. That means
something. I only hope she may
not be sorry when it is too late. I’d
like to talk with her. Ask to see her
to-day, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Annette’s answer was very gravely
uttered. “Certainly, if you wish,”
she said. “But you will not have
much opportunity for conversation
with her.”</p>

<p>He roused himself, just beginning
to take some interest in their talk.
“You can manage it, Annette. Get
her singing for me, then take Sister
Cecilia off out of the room.”</p>

<p>He spoke coaxingly, and with a
faint smile; but she did not lift her
eyes. “You know there must be no
trifling with such a person, Lawrence.
Why need you wish to speak to
Anita? Is it impossible for you to
see an interesting girl without trying
to captivate her? You need not be
proud of such success.”</p>

<p>He threw himself back on the
cushions again. “Oh! if you are
jealous, there is no more to be said
about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[804]</a></span></p>

<p>As she remained silent, he presently
stole a questioning glance into her
face, and, seeing the cloud on it,
smiled again. It always amused him
to see any evidence of his power
over women, and no proof could be
stronger than the sight of their pain.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly now, Ninon!” he
said softly. “You know I don’t
mean to trifle nor flirt, but only to
satisfy my curiosity. I never spoke
to a young vestal like that, and I
would like to know what sort of language
they use. Be good, dear!”</p>

<p>That coaxing voice could still
make her smile, though it could no
longer cheat her into delight. She
looked at him indulgently, as one
looks at a spoilt child whom one has
no desire to reprove, yet sighs over.
“I will do what I can, Lawrence;
but you must be careful not to behave
so that the sisters will wish to
exclude you in future.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good girl!”</p>

<p>Then his momentary gaiety dropped
off like a mask.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like to see that kind of
religion,” he resumed. “But I hate
a gilt-edged piety. I despise those
people who are so nice that they call
the devil ‘the D., you know,’ and
whose religion is all promenade-dress
and genuflections. I suspect
them. I was talking the other day
with a lady who said something
about the ‘D., you know,’ and I
answered, ‘No, I don’t know. What
do you mean?’ She had to say it;
and I haven’t a doubt she always
says it when she is angry. Bah!”</p>

<p>They had reached the gate, and,
seeing no one, alighted and left the
carriage there. But Sister Cecilia
met them at the entrance, her welcoming
smile like a benediction.</p>

<p>As they entered the parlor, they
surprised a little domestic tableau.
The door leading to an inner room
was partly open, and braced against
a chair in which were a pail of
steaming water and a bar of soap.
Sister Bernadette, the chief music-teacher,
held the door-knob in one
hand, while with the other she was
vigorously scouring the panels. Her
sleeves were rolled up to the shoulders,
a large apron covered her from
chin to slipper, and her veil was removed.
As she scoured, her full,
sweet face was uplifted, and her
large blue eyes watched the success
of her labor with perfect earnestness
and good-will.</p>

<p>A burst of laughter revealed the
spectators to her. Mr. Gerald stood
just within the room, bowing profoundly,
with gravity and some diffidence,
but the two ladies were
thoroughly amused.</p>

<p>“Would you not think,” cried
Sister Cecilia, “that she expected to
see that dingy old door turn between
her hands into the great pearl of
the New Jerusalem gate? You certainly
did expect a miracle, Bernadette.”</p>

<p>Sister Bernadette’s blush was but
momentary, only the rapid color of
surprise that faded away in dimples as
she smiled. Her sleeves were pulled
down and her veil snatched on in a
trice, and she went to meet their
visitors with an air that would have
adorned a drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Sister is a witch,” she said. “I
was thinking of the gates of the New
Jerusalem, though not expecting a
miracle.”</p>

<p>This lady, whom we find scrubbing
a door, with her sleeves rolled up,
was the child of wealth and gentle
blood. She had beauty, talents, and
culture, and her life had been without
a cloud, save those light ones
that only enhance the surrounding
brightness. Yet she had turned away
from the world, not in bitterness and
disappointment, nor because it was
to her unbeautiful, but because its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[805]</a></span>
fragments of beauty served only to
remind her of the infinite loveliness.
She had not Sister Cecilia’s enthusiasm;
but her heart was a fountain
for ever full of love, and cheerfulness,
and a gentle courage. She seemed
to live in a sunny, spiritual calm
above the storms of life.</p>

<p>After a few graceful words, she took
leave, promising to send Anita to
them. Miss Ferrier wished Mr. Gerald
to hear the girl play on the piano,
and Miss Ferrier was a benefactor
to their community, and, therefore,
a person to be obliged. Otherwise
they might not have thought it profitable
for the child to receive a
morning-call from fashionable people
who were neither related to nor intimate
with her.</p>

<p>Anita came in presently, as a
moonbeam comes in when you lift
the curtain at night. Softly luminous
and without sound, it is there. This
girl was rather small and dark-haired,
and had a dazzling fairness of
complexion to which her simple
brown dress was in admirable contrast.
Her eyes were blue and
almost always downcast, as if she
would wish to hide that full, unsteady
radiance that shone out through
them. Nothing could have been
more charming than her manner&mdash;timid
without awkwardness, and
showing that innocent reserve of a
child which springs neither from fear
nor distrust. She met Miss Ferrier
sweetly, but was not the first to extend
her hand; and Annette’s kiss,
to which she only submitted, left a
red spot on her cheek which lingered
for some time after. She was one of
those sensitive flowers that shrink
from the lightest touch. No love
was delicate enough for her except
that ineffable love of the “Spouse of
virgins.”</p>

<p>Lawrence Gerald watched her with
enchantment. The immense gravity
and respect of her salutation to him
had made him smile. It was a new
study for him. How sunburnt and
hackneyed Annette seemed beside
this fair little cloistered snowdrop!
Poor Annette, with her grieved and
disappointed heart, which surely had
not chosen the rough ways of the
world, and would gladly have been
loved and shielded as this girl had
been, received scant charity from the
man whose sole hope she was. So
are our misfortunes imputed to us as
crimes!</p>

<p>Anita played admirably on the
piano, turning the music for herself.
After her first gentle refusal of his
help, Lawrence did not venture to
press the matter, fearing to alarm her
timidity; but he seated himself near,
and, affecting not to observe her,
watched every movement.</p>

<p>After the first piece, Miss Ferrier
and Sister Cecilia, seated by a distant
window, began to talk in whispers
about various business affairs; but as
the gentleman by the piano was listening,
and pushed toward her a second
sheet of music when she laid the
first aside, the performer did not rise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Sister Cecilia was saying,
her eyes fixed on a rough sofa the
nuns had themselves stuffed cushions
for, “I think there is something up-stairs
that will do to cover it. We
have several large packages that
have not been opened. They were
sent here the day after Mother Chevreuse
died, and we have had no
heart to touch them since. There
are some shawls, and blankets, and
quilts that Mrs. Macon gathered for
us from any one who would give.
I am sure we shall find something
there that will do very well.”</p>

<p>“And now sing for me,” Lawrence
said gently, as Anita ended her
second piece. “I am sure you sing.
You....” He checked himself
there, not daring to finish his speech.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[806]</a></span>
“You have the full throat of a singing-bird,”
he was going to say.</p>

<p>He placed on the music-rack a
simple little <i>Ave Maria</i>, and she
sang it in a pure, flute-toned voice,
and with a composed painstaking to
do her best that provoked him. He
leaned a little, only a little, nearer
when she had ended, and sat with
her eyes downcast, the lashes making
a shadow on her smooth, colorless
cheeks.</p>

<p>“It is a sweet song,” he said; “but
you can sing what is far more difficult
and expressive. Sing once
again, something stronger. Give me
a love-song.”</p>

<p>He trembled at his own audacity,
and his face reddened as he brought
out the last words. Would she start
up and rush out of the room?
Would she blush, or burst into tears?
Nothing of the kind. She merely
sat with her eyes downcast, and
her fingers resting lightly on the
keys, and tried to recollect something.</p>

<p>Then a little smile, faint from
within, touched the corners of her
mouth, her eyes were lifted fully
and fixed on air, and she sang that
hymn beloved by S. Francis Xaverius:</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">“O Deus! ego amo te.”</p>

<p class="p1">It was no longer the pale and
timid novice. Fire shone from her
uplifted eyes, a roseate color warmed
her transparent face, and the soul
of a smile hovered about her lips.
It was the bride singing to her Beloved.</p>

<p>When she had finished the last
words, the singer turned toward the
window, as if looking to Sister Cecilia
for sympathy, knowing well that
only with her could she find it, and
perceived then that she was alone
with Lawrence Gerald.</p>

<p>Annette, half ashamed of herself
for doing it, had kept her promise,
and lured the sister out of the parlor
on some pretext.</p>

<p>Anita rose immediately, made the
gentleman a slight obeisance, and
glided from the room without uttering
a word.</p>

<p>When she had gone, he sat there
confounded. “She a child!” he muttered.
“She is the most self-possessed
and determined woman I ever
met.”</p>

<p>The love-song he had asked for
addressed to God, and her abrupt
departure, were to his mind proofs
of the most mortifying rebuff he had
ever received.</p>

<p>But he mistook, not knowing the
difference between a child of earth
and a child of heaven. That he
could mean any other kind of love-song
than the one she had sung
never entered Anita’s mind. Love
was to her an everyday word, oftener
on her lips than any other. She
spoke of love in the last waking moment
at night and the first one in
the morning. There was no reason
why she should fear the word. As
to the rest, it was nothing but obedience.</p>

<p>“Why did you come out, my
dear?” asked Sister Cecilia, meeting
her in the entry.</p>

<p>“Sister Bernadette told me never
to remain alone with a gentleman,”
Anita replied simply.</p>

<p>Lawrence was just saying to himself
that, after all, her fear of staying
with him was rather flattering, when
she re-entered the room with Annette
and the sister, and came to the
piano again. It was impossible for
vanity to blind him. He had not
stirred the faintest ripple on the surface
of her heart. It was a salutary
mortification.</p>

<p>Sister Cecilia carried in her hands
a man’s large gray shawl. Opening
it out, she threw it over their improvised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span>
sofa, and tucked it in around the
arms and the cushions. “It will do
nicely,” she said. “And we do not
need it for a wrap or a spread.”</p>

<p>Annette viewed it a little. “So it
will,” she acquiesced. “A few large
pins will keep it in place. But here
is a little tear in the corner. Let
me turn it the other way. There!
that does nicely, doesn’t it, Lawrence?”</p>

<p>She turned in speaking to him,
but he was not there. He had
stepped out into the porch, and was
beckoning Jack to drive the carriage
up inside the grounds.</p>

<p>They took leave after a minute.</p>

<p>“Be sure you all pray for the success
of our concert,” was Annette’s
farewell charge to the sister. “We
are to have our last rehearsal to-night.”</p>

<p>She glanced into her companion’s
face as they drove along, but refrained
from asking him any questions
about his interview with Anita.
His expression did not indicate that
he had derived much pleasure from it.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c808" id="c808">AN ART PILGRIMAGE THROUGH ROME.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Rome</span> as we saw it in 1863 was
already so far modernized as to possess
two railway lines, one on the
Neapolitan and one on the Civita
Vecchia side. The old and more
romantic entrance was by the Porta
del Popolo, which was reached by
crossing the Ponte Molle. Two
traditions help to invest this plain,
strong bridge with peculiar interest.
It was within sight of it that the
great battle was fought which decided
the triumph of Constantine and
Christianity in the already tottering
Roman Empire. Here the miraculous
cross appeared to the great
leader the night before the battle,
lighting up the horizon with its mystic
radiance, and blazoning forth
those prophetic words: <i>In hoc signo
vinces</i>&mdash;“In this sign shalt thou conquer”&mdash;which
were afterwards graven
as the motto of the emperor on his
new standard, or <i>labarum</i>. Near the
Ponte Molle, too, then called Pons
Milviensis, were the spoils of the
temple, and notably the seven-branched
candlestick, thrown into
the Tiber to save them from the
hands of the invading Huns; and it
is seriously believed that, were the
river to be drained and carefully
dredged in that spot, many rare and
valuable historical relics would be
found. It is supposed that, the flow
of the water being very sluggish, and
the mud, with its tawny color, oozy
and detaining, these treasures may
easily have remained embedded in
their unsavory hiding-place.</p>

<p>The modern entrance from the
Civita Vecchia side is unattractive in
the extreme, but the new depot at
the Piazza de’ Termini affords a very
fair first view of Rome. Before
reaching the city, a beautiful spectacle
is presented by the long rows of
aqueducts standing sharply defined
out of the low, olive-spotted plain,
and by the massive tomb of Cecilia
Metella, rising in towering prominence
among the lesser monuments
of the Appian Way. Beautiful at all
times, this scene of lovely and
suggestive grandeur is still more
beautiful by moonlight; and, if one
could forget the unfortunate details
of that most prosaic of modern buildings,
a railway-station, the Piazza de’
Termini would hardly break the
spell. On one side are the ruins of
the baths of Diocletian, their brick
walls covered with golden wall-flowers,
and just beyond them the
cloister and church of Santa Maria
degli Angeli. The interior of this
church is supported by huge monolith
columns of granite, still bearing
the marks of the fire which destroyed
the baths, from whose adjoining
halls they were taken. On the
opposite side are the prisons for
women&mdash;a far happier and more
peaceful abode than most places of
the sort, the <i>jailers</i> being cloistered
sisters specially vowed to this heroic
work of self-devotion. A little further
on is the great fountain, divided
into three compartments, each backed
by a <i>basso-rilievo</i> of great merit,
the centre one representing in gigantic
proportions Moses striking the
rock. The small domed church of
the Vittoria, which faces the fountain,
is the national <i>ex-voto</i> commemorating
the battle of Lepanto, and
boasts a masterpiece of one of the
sculptors of the Renaissance&mdash;a term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>
too often convertible with artistic decadence.
This is a languishing and
affected but marvellously correct statue
of S. Teresa on her death-bed;
and the church is served by barefooted
Carmelite friars. The streets
branching from the Piazza, though
not so narrow, are to the full as
crooked as those in the lower portion
of the city; but, to the practised Italian
traveller, they will appear almost
wide. Those of Genoa and Venice
are veritable lanes, through which
two wheelbarrows could not pass
each other, and across which you
could literally shake hands out of the
windows of each floor; so that the
Roman streets do not strike you as
uncommonly narrow, unless you are
fresh from Paris or Munich.</p>

<p>Here are the same peculiarities
as in most other Italian towns, but
fraught with a deeper meaning, since
we are at the headquarters of the
religion which gives them birth: the
frequent shrines at the street-corners,
chiefly of the Blessed Virgin and
the divine Infant, rudely enough
represented, but denoting the steadfast
faith of the people, and kept perpetually
adorned by a lighted oil-lamp
in a blue or red glass; the stalls in the
markets, which, by the way, stand only
in the dingier thoroughfares round
the Pantheon and S. Eustachio;
the strange medley of meat, vegetables,
flowers, antiquities; in summer,
the mounds of cut water-melons
(the Roman’s favorite fruit),
and the ricketty stands piled with
figs in all the confused shades of
purple, black, green, and white; in
winter, the <i>scaldini</i>, or little square
boxes filled with charcoal, which the
market-women carry about everywhere&mdash;to
market, to church, and
very often to bed; the curious antique
lamps of brass with two or
three beaks, each bearing a weak
flame, and the whole thing a copy,
line for line, of the old Roman lamps
of two thousand years ago; on S.
Joseph’s day, the 19th of March, the
stalls decorated with garlands of
green, and heaped with <i>fritellette</i> (fried
fish under various disguises); the
peasant funeral winding slowly
through the crowd, with the corpse,
that of a young girl, lying uncovered,
but enwreathed in simple flowers, on
an open bier borne by the cowled
members of a pious brotherhood
specially dedicated to this work, and
whose faces even are covered, leaving
only the eyes visible through two
narrow slits; the droves of Campagna
oxen, cream-colored, mild,
Juno-eyed, and with thick, smooth,
branching horns; the flocks of Campagna
buffaloes, shaggy and fierce,
with eyes like pigs, humps on their
necks, and short, crooked horns&mdash;a
very fair impersonation of the evil
one for an imaginary “temptation
of S. Anthony”; then, finally, at
Christmas time, the <i>pifferari</i>, peasants
of the Abruzzi, whose immemorial
custom it is to come on an
annual musical pilgrimage to Rome,
and play their mountain airs before
every street-shrine in the city.</p>

<p>These latter are deserving of a
more lengthened notice, and, indeed,
no traveller can fail to be struck by
the rugged picturesqueness of their
appearance. Some one has not inappropriately
called them the “satyrs
of the Campagna,” though they belong
rather to the mountain than
to the plain. Their dress is that
which we are erroneously taught to
connect with the traditional ideal of
a brigand (an ideal, by the way, very
unjustly supposed to be realized by
the honest, industrious, and deluded
peasants of whom New York has
recently said such hard things)&mdash;a
high, conical felt hat, with a frayed
feather or red band and tassels; a
red waistcoat; a coarse blue jacket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[810]</a></span>
and leggings, sometimes of the shaggy
hair of white goats (hence the
title satyr), sometimes of tanned skin
bound round with cords that interlace
as far as the knee. The ample
cloak common to all Roman and
Neapolitan peasants completes the
costume, and gives it a dignity which
sits well upon them. Their instruments
are very primitive, and the
tunes they perform are among the
oldest national airs of Italy, transmitted
intact from father to son by
purely oral teaching. They always
go in couples, and, while one plays
the <i>zampogna</i>, or bagpipe, the other
accompanies him on the <i>piffero</i>, or pastoral
pipe&mdash;a short, flute-like instrument.
These are the men who make
the fortunes of many an artist, and
who, as models, are transformed as
often as Proteus or Jupiter of old.
The broad flight of steps leading
from the Piazza di Spagna to the
Pincian hill is their chief resort when
off duty as <i>pifferari</i>, and on the lookout
as models; and any guide could
show you among them Signor So-and-So’s
“Moses,” or Madame Such-a-one’s
“S. Joseph,” besides innumerable
other characters, Biblical and
classical, sustained by at most only a
dozen men of flesh and blood. A
few women there are among them,
some in the characteristic but rare
costume which is erroneously supposed
to be the only one worn in the
neighborhood of Rome, namely, the
square fold of spotless linen on the
head (a style almost Egyptian in
its massiveness) and narrow skirt of
darkest blue, with an apron of carpet-like
pattern and texture. A row of
heavy coral beads encircles their
throats, and the ample folds of their
loose chemise of white cotton are confined
by a blue bodice laced up the
front. These figures suggest themselves
as splendid models for a set
of Caryatides, but they are more
usually painted as typical peasant
women, and sometimes, when old,
as S. Elizabeth, S. Anne, or the
Sibyls.</p>

<p>The confusion of gaily-attired or
dark-robed figures in the streets is at
first bewildering to the stranger, especially
on a festival day, when one
would think that the middle ages
had broken up through the thin crust
of levelling modern decorum. Here
are Capuchin friars, in their coarse
brown tunics confined round the
waist by a white knotted cord, hurrying
with large baskets on their arms
from house to house to collect their
meal of broken refuse; further on is
a Papal zouave in his uniform of
gray and his white half-leggings&mdash;a
foreigner and very likely a noble,
fair, slight, and dignified, like Col.
de Charrette, the grandson of the
great Vendean leader of 1793; here,
again, comes an <i>abbate</i>, with his enormous
black three-cornered hat and
his long and ample cloak or garment
gathered in a line of full, close folds
at his back, and sweeping thence
around his person with all the picturesque
dignity of a Roman toga;
jostling against this dark figure is the
lithe, cat-like French soldier, cheery
and open-faced; beyond him hurry
lackeys in rich but faded liveries
that look as if they had been
fashioned out of tapestry; peasants
in every garb, some clustering
round a <i>scrivano</i>, or public letter-writer,
established in the open air at
a rickety table, with a few sheets of
dirty paper and a heap of limp red
wafers for his stock in trade; and
others intent upon their birthright,
<i>i.e.</i> noisy and successful begging.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most curious
sights to a stranger is to be found in
the back yards of houses inhabited
by swarms of families who have but
one well among them from which to
draw water. The well is in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>
of the courtyard, and from it
to every window of the house (and
often of several adjoining houses)
runs a strong wire cord. On this is
slung a bucket, which is let down or
drawn up by a pulley easily managed
from the window; and all day
long this ingenious manœuvre is
constantly repeated with sundry
whirring noises quite novel to the
northern ear. It would need volumes
to give any idea of the mere
outer picturesqueness of Roman
scenes, much more of the varied
beauties that do not at once catch
the eye. The Ghetto, or Jews’
quarter, affords one of the most
peculiar street-sights. The streets
here are narrower, darker, filthier
than elsewhere, the stalls are dingier,
the poverty more apparent. Rags
everywhere and in every stage of
dilapidation&mdash;rags hung out over
your head like banners; rags spread
on the knees of the industrious women,
who with deft fingers are mending
and darning them; rags laid in
shelves and coffers; rags clothing the
swarthy children that tumble about
the grimy door-steps&mdash;a very nightmare
of rags. And among them,
exiles: gorgeous robes hidden away
where you would least expect them,
rare laces of gossamer texture and
historical interest, brocades that once
graced a coronation, and even gems
that the Queen of Sheba might have
envied. Mingled in race and broken
in spirit as are these Jews, weak descendants
of the stern old Bible heroes,
one touching evidence of their
loyalty to their ancient traditions remains.
We were told of it by Dr.
O&mdash;&mdash;, of the Propaganda College,
who had many friends among the
Hebrew Rabbis. The Arch of Titus
in the Forum, or what is now vulgarly
called the Campo Vaccino (oxen’s
field or market), is a magnificent trophy
commemorating the last victory
of Rome over Jerusalem. Its <i>bassorilievi</i>,
both exterior and interior, represent
the sacking of the Holy City
and the despoiling of the temple.
The carvings of the triumphal procession
bearing aloft the rifled treasures
of the Holy of Holies, the
great seven-branched candlestick,
the mystic table of the “loaves of
proposition,” the golden bowls and
censers, naturally enough excite feelings
of bitter regret in the breast of
the exiled and wandering race. So
it happens that no good and true
Jew passing through the Forum will
ever follow the road that leads under
this beautiful sculptured monument
of his country’s fall, nor even let its
shadow fall upon his head as he
passes it by. This sign of faithful
mourning certainly struck us as very
significant and poetical. There are
two synagogues in the Ghetto, and
it is curious to reflect that these Hebrew
temples were tolerated within
the walls of Rome by a government
which proscribed Anglican chapels
and relegated the worship of the
English visitors beyond the Porta
del Popolo. This restriction may
have unheedingly been called intolerant;
but let us stay for a moment
to examine its reason. Rome was a
theocracy and swayed by directly
opposite principles to any other existing
state, and it could no more
allow of promiscuous worship within
its domain than of old the Hebrew
high-priest could have allowed the
Moabitish altars to be erected at the
doors of the Ark of God. In speaking
of the Rome of the popes, it is
absolutely necessary for a non-Catholic
to set his mind to a different
focus from that which answers the
ordinary purposes of travel and observation;
it is necessary to do as
Hawthorne says somewhere in his
romance of the <i>Marble Faun</i>&mdash;that
is, to look at the pictured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[812]</a></span>
window of a great cathedral <i>from
the inside</i>, where the harmony of
form, of color, and of distribution
is plainly visible; not from the
<i>outside</i>, where an unmeaning network
of dark, irregular patches of
glass vexes the eye of the gazer.</p>

<p>One is apt at first to wander
through these Roman streets in the
indecision brought on by <i>l’embarras
des richesses</i>. Shall we seek the
Rome of religion, of history, or of
art? Shall we make a tour of the
churches or the studios first? Or
shall we go at once to the colossal
ruins, and bury ourselves in the annals
of the old republic? All these
regions have been thoroughly explored,
and there are guides, both
living and dead, to lead one through
the divers cities existing within the
bosom of the whilom mistress of
the world. The streets themselves
are a series of pictures, from the Via
Condotti&mdash;where the most finished
masterpieces of antique jewellery
are successfully imitated, and where
wealthy strangers crowd round the
counters, eager to take home keepsakes
for less fortunate friends&mdash;to
the Piazza Montanara, where the
handsome peasants from the country
mingle with the stalwart Frasteverini,
who boast of being lineal descendants
of the ancient Romans. One
thing which is very apt to strike any
thoughtful observer upon a first saunter
through Rome (we speak of
1863) is the sovereignty of religion
in every department of life. Art is
wholly moulded by it, domestic life
pervaded by it, municipal life simply
founded on it. Every monument of
note is stamped with its impress, as
the Pantheon; every ruin is consecrated
to its service, as the Coliseum.
Every public building bears on its
walls the keys and tiara of the Papacy
side by side with the “S. P. Q. R.”
of the city arms (<i>Senatus Populusque
Romanus</i>). Even the private galleries
are under government protection,
and not one of the pictures can be
sold without the leave of the authorities.
The very collections of classic
statuary are the work of successive
ecclesiastical rulers. Education is
essentially religious (as it always
is in any country whose ideal still
remains civilized and does not approximate
to that of the irresponsible
denizen of the forests), and at
the same time national, since every
nation has here its own representative
college. The archæological discoveries
in the catacombs and at
the Dominican Convent of San Clemente
open a new branch of research
peculiar to Rome, while modern
art instinctively follows in the
same religious groove, and spends itself
chiefly on the imitation of Christian
mosaics, the manufacture of
costly articles of devotion, such as
reliquaries, crucifixes, rosaries, and
the rivalry of both foreign and native
artists to invent new æsthetical
expositions of religious truth, new
embodiments of religious symbols.
From the street-shrines which we
have passed to the studios of Christian
artists and the examination of
ancient Christian art there is, therefore,
less distance than one would
think. The same idea has created
them, and the faith which keeps the
lamp alight and inspires the <i>pifferaro’s</i>
tribute is the same that guides
the chisel of the sculptor and the
brush of the painter. It is certainly
a remarkable fact that in Rome
there is perhaps less landscape-painting
than in many other schools
and centres of art, and that, too, in a
country so picturesque, so full of
that pathetic southern beauty of luminous
atmosphere and intense coloring.
The human element, and,
above all, the religious, seems, as by
divine right, to blot out every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span>
in this mystic capital, not of the
world alone, but of the whole realm
of intellect. Classicism itself, the
child of the soil, seems an alien
growth here, and one wanders
through miles of antique statuary as
one would through some gigantic
collection of exotics in a northern
clime, expecting every moment to return
to a different and more normal
atmosphere. So it is not to be wondered
at, when exploring the field of
modern art, that so many of those
wild-looking Germans, with long, fair
hair and bushy beards, extravagance
of costume, and universal abundance
of the plaid shawl serving as an overcoat,
should be engaged on S. Jeromes
or S. Catherines rather than on
Apollos or Minervas.</p>

<p>The Italians are best represented
among the sculptors, and Tenerani,
Giacometti, and Benzoni have made
their religious statuary famous through
the Christian world. Discarding the
influence of the Renaissance, they
have returned to the austere ideal so
well understood by Canova and exemplified
in his figures of Justice
and Mercy on the tomb of Clement
XIV. in S. Peter’s&mdash;the ideal which
Michael Angelo forsook when he
introduced “muscular Christianity”
into art. Tenerani’s “Angel of Judgment,”
intended for the tomb of a
Prussian princess, is a magnificent
conception. Colossal in size, and
divinely impassible in expression,
this grand figure stands as if in the
last dread pause before the call,
holding uplifted in his mighty hand
the trumpet that is to awaken the
dead. It is impossible to give an
adequate impression of this statue,
so majestic and so simple, with its
massive drapery falling straight to
the feet, not tortured with a thousand
undignified wrappings, nor flying like
a stiffly frozen scarf around the bared
limbs, as it does on the wretched
angels whom Bernini has perched upon
the bridge opposite the Mole of
Adrian. The two lifelike statues of
Christ and his betrayer, Judas, which
are placed at the foot of the Scala
Santa, one of the most venerated
shrines of Rome, are also Tenerani’s
handiwork. Judas clutches a bag of
money in his left hand, which he tries
to hide behind his back, while his
bent body and the low animal cunning
in his look betray the sordid
eagerness that prompts him. Opposite
this statue is that of our Saviour,
whose attitude, full of dignity and
repose, is more that of a lenient
judge than of an entrapped victim.
As far as marble can be god-like,
this figure borrows something of the
lofty characteristics of its original;
and it is to be noticed that sculpture
can more easily than painting
attain such quasi-perfection. We
have all been repeatedly struck by
the effeminacy of almost every representation
of our Lord, but this
danger is much diminished in marble,
the material itself being more
or less incapable of sensuous interpretation.
This is very evident in
entirely or partially undraped figures,
which are redeemed from the alluring
repulsiveness of the same subjects
on canvas by a certain firmness
of outline and breadth of contour
suggestive of strength rather
than tenderness, dignity rather than
charm.</p>

<p>One very beautiful group in marble
was the “Taking down from the
Cross,” which in 1863 was still in the
<i>atelier</i> of a German sculptor, whose
name we have forgotten. The realistic
details, such as the nails still
embedded in the sacred hands of the
Redeemer, the crown of thorns, the
tears of the Magdalen who is embracing
his feet, were marvellously
and yet not painfully correct, while
the whole expression of the artistically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[814]</a></span>
grouped figures was touchingly
Christian. Benzoni’s Eve was another
well-known masterpiece, of
which many fac-similes by the sculptor
himself were constantly sold to
rich English or Russian patrons;
but its chief merit was the wonderful
hair, upon which the “mother of
all the living” half sits, and which
is chiselled with minute accuracy.
The statue might be that of a beautiful
bather or a grandly moulded
Venus, save for the symbolic serpent
twined around the stump of the tree
on which she leans.</p>

<p>Gibson, the English sculptor, was
the apostle of the revived art of tinting
statues. He contended that such
was the custom of the ancients, and
brought forward many proofs in
favor of his assertion, notably a
statue of Augustus discovered at the
baths of Livia during our stay in
Rome, and which bore marks of
gilding and vermilion on the fringes
of its drapery. Gibson’s studio was
a pagan temple, the representative
of classic naturalism, very beautiful,
but equally soulless. His tinted Venus
was the marvel of the London
Exhibition of 1862, and now he was
at work giving the finishing touch
to a very lovely tinted Hebe. The
flesh was skilfully tinged to a faint
pink hue, so faint that it suggested
ivory with a glow upon it rather
than actual flesh; and here and there,
for instance, round the short kirtle
and on the band around the forehead,
ran a pencil-line of gold in
delicate tracery. The artist, gray and
withered, and pacing among his statues
in a loose sort of <i>déshabillé</i>, reminded
one of the ancient Greek
philosophers discoursing on their favorite
theories. He was altogether
a cultivated and charming pagan,
and had conceptions of the Greek
myths which would have delighted
Phidias. He explained his Bacchus
to us most enthusiastically, dwelling
on the mistake often made of delineating
him as the bloated god of intemperance
and coarse indulgence.
“I have made him,” he said, pointing
to his statue, crowned with vine-leaves,
“not less beautiful than Apollo;
for he was the god of youth and
pleasure, of dance and song, and not
the type of brutal revelry some people
would have us believe. He left
that to Silenus.” This statue was not
tinted. Whether the ancients did or
did not as a rule use color as an adjunct
of sculpture, or whether, if they
did, it was only in the degenerate
stage of art, we cannot pretend to
say; but, to our mind, such a practice
seriously detracts from the severe
beauty of statuary. It seems a pandering
to passion, a compromise to
allure the imagination, and even a
confession of weakness on the part
of the artist.</p>

<p>Story, the American sculptor, was
and is by far the ablest representative
of secular art in Rome. His
two magnificent statues of Cleopatra
and the Libyan Sibyl were the gems
of the “Roman Court” in the London
Exhibition of 1862. The former
(or a <i>replica</i> of it) is in Mr. Johnston’s
gallery of modern pictures in
New York. Story has given his heroine
something of the Egyptian
type, thereby forsaking the arbitrary
rule that decreed the Greek type
only to be admissible in sculpture;
and, if he has lost in mere physical
beauty, he has amply gained in power.
In his Cleopatra, he has not
given us the voluptuous woman, but
the captive queen, brooding over the
fall of her sovereignty, looking into
futurity with gloomy apprehension;
for she sees her empire enslaved, her
nationality wiped out, her dynasty
forgotten. We dare not pity her, for
she is above such a tribute; we cannot
despise her, for we feel that contempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span>
would not reach her. She is
here the tangible embodiment of a
principle rather than the splendid
sinner of flesh and blood; and involuntarily
we admire and reverence
her, and are silent before her imperial
woe. The Libyan Sibyl is not
unlike the Cleopatra in general effect,
and bears the same stamp of
loftiness of mind on the part of the
artist.</p>

<p>Of Hoffman, a very different
sculptor, and the adopted son of
Overbeck, we remember but one
work, as he died between our first
and second visits to Rome, and our
recollection of him dates, therefore,
from a somewhat childish period.
This work was the bust of a Madonna,
in which seemed blended in some
indescribable way the softness of
the painter’s art and the firmness of
the sculptor’s. The head is slightly
bent forward, and the eyes look
modestly down. Over the back of
the head falls a veil, and the brow is
bound by a simple crown of <i>fleur-de-lis</i>.
The expression is radiant yet
grave, and the artist has ventured to
use the help of gilding to embellish
the veil and circlet. But how different
the effect from that produced by
Gibson’s tinting! The thread-like
mediæval tracery that forms the
half-inch border to the veil, and the
line of gold that just defines the contour
of the crown, have not the least
disturbing effect in the harmony of
the whole pure composition. One
would think that this was the head
of the white-robed Virgin in Beato
Angelico’s fresco in the Convent of
San Marco at Florence, translated into
marble.</p>

<p>Christian art in the department of
painting is chiefly represented by the
new German school of Overbeck.
The master himself, a worthy follower
of the religious painters of the
XIVth and XVth centuries, was
quite a study. His enthusiastic explanations
of his cartoons of the
Seven Sacraments, which were in his
<i>atelier</i> at the time we visited him,
were very impressive. His own appearance
was singularly in harmony
with the tone of his works, and,
by its dignified asceticism, could not
fail to remind one that to paint as
he did is to pray. One of his most
beautiful productions is now at Munich&mdash;a
half-length Madonna&mdash;in
whose draperies he has managed to
combine the most richly varied tints,
all subdued to that velvety depth
and mellowness which is so peculiar
to some of the old Pre-Raphaelite
masters, and which always suggests
to our mind the tints seen in mediæval
stained glass. The Christian
revival linked with his name has
spread far and wide, and all over
England, Germany, and France are
found memorials of its inspiration.
The nudities of the Renaissance, the
anatomies of the school of Michael
Angelo, and the handsome, robust
materialities of even the later manner
of Raphael were banished to the
realm of secular art, and the revived
ideal of religious chivalry was no
longer the muscular athlete, the
handsome peasant, or the graceful
<i>odalisque</i>. Many disciples followed
the new artistic school, and one of
these, Seitz, of whom we have had
personal knowledge, may well find a
place here. Seitz had his studio
near the Piazza Barberini, and, when
we went in a party to see him, he
was at work on a beautiful group of
saints arrayed round the throne of
the Virgin and Child. It was a
thoroughly characteristic picture, designed
according to the mediæval
custom of representing the family of
the owner by their respective patron
saints. It was destined for a Gothic
chapel in England, and has since
been transferred there, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[816]</a></span>
ordered by a connoisseur in religious
art and ecclesiastical archæology.
The minuteness and accuracy of detail,
such as are required by the
costumes of S. Charles Borromeo
(cardinal), of S. Francis of Sales,
(bishop), and S. Ida (a Benedictine
nun), are perfect, yet without a trace
of that pagan naturalism which, since
the days of the Medici, has uncrowned
every ideal, and lowered even
historical dignity to the level of vulgar
domesticity. The researches
necessary to a correct representation
of such royal garments as are distinctive
of S. Constance, the daughter
of the Emperor Constantine; S.
Edith, the royal Saxon abbess; S.
Edward the Confessor, who holds in
his hand a model of his foundation,
Westminster Abbey; and of S. Elizabeth
of Hungary, the queenly almsgiver,
whose loaves of bread were
turned to wreaths of red roses as her
husband was about to upbraid her
for her too lavish generosity, are
also shown, by the success of these
figures, to have been deep and painstaking.
S. Thomas of Canterbury,
patron of the chapel for which the
altar-piece was intended, is also very
beautifully represented, the pallium
and crozier faithfully copied, while a
knife, placed transversely in the interstices
of the pastoral staff, points
out symbolically the manner of his
heroic death. The main figures, the
Virgin and Child, are radiant with
heavenly grace as well as dignity,
the tints of the former’s robe being
exquisitely delicate, almost transparent
in their ethereal suggestiveness,
while the disposition of the folds is
both grave and modest. The picture
is on a gold ground, and divided into
three panels by XIIth century <i>colonnettes</i>
of twisted gold, while the names
of the saints are inscribed in Lombardic
characters on the breadth of
the frame. Before we take our leave
of modern art, of which, of course, we
do not pretend to have given more
than a very superficial summary, we
must not forget the restored mosaics
in the Basilica of S. Paul. This is
outside the walls of Rome, and has
been in continual process of rebuilding
and embellishment for over forty
years. The great fire of 1822, which
destroyed the old Basilica, and swept
away the carved cedar roof which was
one of its chief glories, only spared
the apse containing some valuable
mosaics of the Theodosian period&mdash;an
enthroned Christ, around which
was an inscription recounting how
the Empress Galla Placidia and
Pope Leo the Great had finished
the decorations of the church, and
several medallions purporting to
represent the first twenty or thirty
popes. Among the renovating tasks
to be undertaken, that of continuing
the series of Papal mosaics became
one of the foremost. Those pontiffs
of whom some authentic likeness
remained, whether in casts, busts,
medals, or on canvas, were represented
according to these data; while,
for the earlier popes of whom no reliable
memorial was left, tradition
and symbolism were appealed to.
The artists took great pains in collecting
and arranging their models,
the ecclesiastical authorities gave
them every help and encouragement
in their power, and the result was a
series of new mosaic medallions running
all round the nave above the
granite columns, hardly distinguishable
from the IVth century work,
and in every respect true to the almost
forgotten traditions of this ancient
branch of art.</p>

<p>Among other praiseworthy restorations
of antique industry is the establishment
of Signor Castellani, a
true artist and enthusiast, who stands
unrivalled in his application to the
study of Etruscan and Roman jewellery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[817]</a></span>
Here may be seen wonderful
and exact reproductions of Roman
<i>bullæ</i>, or golden ornaments,
hung round the necks of youths before
they attained the age at which
they assumed the <i>toga virilis</i>, indicative
of manhood and citizenship;
<i>figulæ</i>, or brooches of gold, wrought
with the heads of lions or leopards,
or chased with vine-leaf patterns;
plain, massive rings, armlets and
golden waistbelts, delicate crowns of
golden myrtle leaves, hair-pins and
ornaments (those with which Roman
ladies are said to have often
struck their female slaves in capricious
anger), and various nondescript
jewellery. Engrafting upon
these ornaments such later conceits
as were appropriate, Castellani produced
rings and brooches bearing
the Greek word <i>Αει</i> (for ever) in
plain Etruscan letters, or the reversible
words, <i>Amor</i>, <i>Roma</i>, etc. Perhaps
the most perfect objects of art
were the necklaces, with their little
amphora-shaped pendants copied
from those found in ancient tombs,
and which are now so well known.
The granulated gold-work used in
many of the more solid pieces of
jewellery is peculiar to Castellani’s
new antique style, and cost much
time, research, and patience to bring
to the old standard, of which the results
were also for a long time the
only recipes.</p>

<p>To return to Christian art and
its early origin, we cannot do
better than go straight to the catacombs.
Apart from their historical
interest, they have the additional
merit of being the birthplace
of Christian symbolism. It should
always be borne in mind that art is a
means, not an end. If it aims only
at mere physical beauty, it degrades
itself to the level of a common trade.
Its inspiration should come from on
high, and its object be to lift the
soul from vulgar to sublime thoughts.
Thus began the art of the catacombs.
It was eminently symbolical,
like the language of Christ himself
in the parables, and like the
venerable traditions of the Old Testament.
We should detain our readers
too long were we to propose
anything like an adequate examination
of the various types found in
the catacombs. The good shepherd
surrounded by his flock, symbolizing
the church; Moses striking
the rock, symbolizing the grace of
the sacraments, particularly baptism;
and Jonas saved from the whale,
and reposing under the miraculous
gourd, typifying the resurrection
and life everlasting, are some of the
most oft-repeated subjects. The
multiplication of the loaves and
fishes also constantly recurs, meaning
the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament,
the sacrifice of the Mass, and
the sacrament of the body of the
Lord under the appearance of bread.
The Deluge and Noe’s ark are frequently
depicted, for the sake of the
symbol they contain&mdash;that of the
church alone saving the human race
amid the general corruption of sin.
The fish is a double symbol, the five
letters of the Greek word <i>Ιχθύς</i> being
the initials of the following words:
Jesus, Christ, Son (of) God, Saviour,
which form a complete confession of
faith; and the animal itself, capable of
existing only in the water, typifying
that by baptism alone does the Christian
soul live. Sometimes the fish is
put for Christ himself; as in two very
ancient catacomb frescos, where it is
seen in the one swimming in the water,
bearing a ship (the church) upon its
back, and in the other bearing a
basket of bread, the type of the Holy
Eucharist. This symbol of the fish
was so universally accepted, and became
so fixed in men’s minds, that
it originated the shape of the episcopal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[818]</a></span>
seal, which was and is still fashioned
like a pointed oval or ogive.
In many frescos, a female figure is
depicted with outstretched hands,
signifying, as some think, the church
in prayer, or, as others say, the
Mother of God interceding for the
church. Among the Christian hieroglyphics,
palms and crowns were
frequent; a dove often represented
the spirit at peace in Christ (this was
frequently the only epitaph on a
Christian’s tomb), and a peacock or a
phœnix, immortality. Here the recollections
of paganism were suited
to Christian doctrines, and, like the
converted temples, did duty in the service
of truth. A curious instance of
this is seen in the frequent recurrence
of the myth of Orpheus depicted in
the frescos of the catacombs, the
Greek shepherd with his lyre standing
for Christ, who by the magic of his
doctrine and his grace tames the
evil passions of man, as Orpheus
tamed the wild beasts of the forest.
In the earlier frescos, we see traces
of the pure Greek models of ancient
painting; the graceful draperies, the
delicate borders remind us of Pompeian
art, but there is nothing immodest,
and the figures themselves
are already of a graver and nobler
type. In the later paintings, the
beauty of detail and ornamentation
grows less, but the grand ideal is yet
more prominent. There is a transition
in art, but the indelible stamp
of Christianity is already impressed
on the struggling types of a more
perfect future. It was fitting that
Christianity should only use pagan
civilization with all its products as a
pedestal&mdash;a noble basis, it is true, but
still only a pedestal&mdash;and should rear
above it a structure wholly her own.
Thus from her inspiration rose a new
architecture purely Christian; new
arts, such as stained glass-making; in
literature, new languages capable of
more spiritual expressions. It is interesting
to find in Rome the tradition
of Christian art so unbroken,
and especially to be able to compare
the earliest efforts at a reverent and
lucid illustration of the truths of faith
with the latest development of the
same sentiment in the new German
pictures. From the catacombs and
San Clemente to the school of Overbeck
the transition is natural, and
we find the same master-spirit guiding
both pictorial expositions. The
seed that produced such painters as
Gian Bellini, Fra Angelico, Masaccio,
Orcagna, Giotto, and Perugino
was destined indeed to be crushed
for full four centuries, but what a
glorious harvest has the bruised grain
yielded in this age! Of all the productions
of the XIXth century, none
to our mind ever deserved its reputation
one-quarter so well as the Christian
and Gothic revival, which is
leading the human mind back to the
spirit of the early church.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>We do not speak of the much-frequented
galleries of the Borghese,
Doria, or Corsini palaces, because
every visitor to Rome knows them
as well as we do; nor of the Stanza
of Raphael in the Vatican&mdash;which we
studied perhaps less than we ought&mdash;because
we should probably offend
many established predilections by so
doing. The pictures most often under
our eyes were those in the Sistine
chapel and in S. Peter’s, and of the
former a most painful impression remains
upon our mind. The Christian
ideal of art is there utterly violated
by a painter who, as a man, was
a most fervent and austere Christian.
The taint of the Renaissance was
upon Michael Angelo when he gave
us an athlete enthroned, in the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[819]</a></span>
of Christ the Judge; and we are happy
to reflect that his spiritual conception
of divine majesty was far
different from his artistic conception.
The <i>pictures</i> in S. Peter’s, except one,
are all mosaics, and a most marvellous
triumph of artistic illusion.
Domenichino’s Communion of S.
Jerome especially is so accurately
copied in this perplexing material
that any one not forewarned will
never dream that he is looking on
anything but canvas. The single
exception is the picture opposite the
Porta Santa Marta, and represents
the judgment that befell Ananias and
Sapphira.</p>

<p>Of all monuments of early Christianity,
whose interest is joined with
that of art, none stands more conspicuous
than the church of San
Clemente, served by the Irish Dominicans,
and under English protection.
The discovery of the subterranean
church and frescos, dating
from the days of S. Clement, the
<i>third</i> successor of S. Peter, was an
era in the history of ecclesiastical
archæology. Believed to have been
the site of S. Clement’s own dwelling,
and to have originated in an oratory
established there by himself, the
Basilica of S. Clement is of a high
antiquity. There are proofs of its
existence in 417, when Pope Zosimus
chose it as the scene of his condemnation
of the Pelagian heresy.
To this date or thereabouts may be
referred a certain Byzantine Madonna
in fresco; and the learned and enthusiastic
F. Mullooly has built upon
this apparent coincidence a very
beautiful and possibly correct theory.
“The very difference,” he says, “between
the heads of S. Catherine and
S. Euphemia, with hair flowing down
from their jewelled crowns&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> human
nature decked with the jewels
of virginity and martyrdom&mdash;and the
countenance of Our Lady, enshrined
in a mass of ornaments, without a
single lock appearing&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> human
nature totally transformed by grace&mdash;indicates
the limner’s scope.” And
again: “<i>All</i> the gifts of grace are
signified by the necklace, breastplate,
and the immense jewelled head-dress,
with its triple crown, borne by Our
Lady.” We hear of S. Clement’s Basilica
again in 600, of its being restored
in 795, and, a century later
(855), of its being in “good order.”
It is not accurately known whether
it was destroyed by the earthquake
of 896 or in the wars of Robert
Guiscard and Pope Gregory VII. in
1084. At any rate, it disappears
from history after this last convulsion,
and not until 1857 was its existence
proved by F. Mullooly’s successful
excavations. He has published a
book upon the subject, conspicuous
for enthusiasm and archæological accuracy.
Many portions of the Basilica
were found in almost perfect
preservation, the columns especially
being of great beauty, variety, and
costliness, both as to material and
workmanship. But the frescos are
the most important part of the silent
testimony to Christian truth borne by
this unearthed antiquity dating almost
from the apostolic age. One in particular
we commend to the notice of
such advanced Anglicans as proclaim
the “Roman” church of to-day to
be other than the apostolic church
of the first four centuries. It represents
S. Clement celebrating Mass at
a small, square altar. We quote F.
Mullooly’s literal description: “The
central compartment represents the
interior of a church, from the arches
of which are suspended <i>seven</i> lamps,
symbolizing the seven gifts of the
Holy Ghost. That over the altar is
circular in form,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> much larger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[820]</a></span>
the other six, and contains <i>seven</i>
lights, probably typical of the seven
gifts of the same Holy Spirit. Anastasius
the librarian, who lived in the
IXth century, makes mention of this
form of lamp, and calls it a <i>pharum
cum corona</i>&mdash;a lighthouse with a
crown&mdash;a crown from its form, a
lighthouse from the brilliancy of the
light it emitted.” He also says that
it was in common use in all the
Christian churches. S. Clement, in
his pontifical robes (<i>i.e.</i> a chasuble,
an alb, etc., and more particularly
a <i>pallium</i>), is officiating at the
altar, over which his name, <i>S.
Clemens, Papa</i>&mdash;Pope S. Clement&mdash;is
written in the form of a cross.
He has the maniple between the
thumb and forefinger of the left
hand. The altar is covered with a
plain white cloth, and on it are the
missal, the chalice, and paten. The
missal is open, and on one page of
it are the words, <i>Dominus vobiscum</i>
(“The Lord be with you”), which
the saint is pronouncing, his arms
extended, as Catholic priests do
even to this day when celebrating
Mass. On the other page are the
words, <i>Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum</i>
(“The peace of the Lord be
ever with you”). These two phrases
were introduced into the liturgy of
the church by S. Clement himself,
and are still retained. On the right
of the saint are his ministers&mdash;namely,
two bishops with croziers in their
left hands, a deacon, and a subdeacon.
They all have the circular
tonsure (the distinguishing mark of
the Latin rite), and the pope, in addition
to the tonsure, has the nimbus,
or glory, the symbol of sanctity.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
In the neighboring fresco of the life
and death of S. Alexius, the Pope,
S. Boniface, is depicted again in similar
pontifical garments, and is attended
by two cross-bearers. Here,
too, are the hanging lamps, four in
number; the clerics, to the number
of twenty, all wear the circular tonsure,
and the pope has on his head
a conical white mitre. It is noticeable
in these early frescos that the
shape of the lamps, chalice, crosses,
and the fashion of the vestments,
chasuble, alb, altar-cloth, and mitre,
are exactly such as are now reproduced
in the English establishments
of Hardman &amp; Co., and the
Browns, of Manchester and Birmingham&mdash;the
style now called Gothic.
F. Mullooly notices the lavishness
of these mural decorations in these
significant words: “They appear to
have been part of a series painted
about the same time; and, when the
colors were fresh, the Basilica must
have presented a brilliant appearance
very different from that Puritanical
baldness which some suppose,
but very falsely, to have been
the <i>undefiled condition</i> of church
walls in the <i>early ages</i>.” A fuller
investigation would reveal many interesting
facts going far to prove,
by human means alone, the identity
of the church of Clement and
that of Pius IX.; and, indeed, it is
chiefly this that strikes all candid
English-speaking visitors to the subterranean
church. In the late Basilica
built over the ruins of this early
one are many objects of artistic
interest, notably the chapel of S.
Catherine of Alexandria, with her
life painted in a series of frescos on
the walls, and the curious marble
enclosure, four feet in height, round
the choir, with the two <i>ambones</i>, or
marble desks, for the reading of the
Gospel and the Epistle. These, together
with the enclosure, which is
raised a step or two above the level
of the nave, are beautifully sculptured;
and already, in these unusual
types of birds, beasts, and flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
we trace that departure from the
tradition of the monotonous acanthus-leaf
which was to blossom forth
into such wonders at the Cathedrals
of Cologne, Chartres, York, and
Burgos. The frescos in S. Catherine’s
chapel it would take too long
to describe; a medallion head of
the saint is especially noticeable for
its great purity of outline and expression,
and the heavenly suggestiveness
which hallows and rarefies
its human beauty. In a cursory
sketch such as this, it is impossible
to do justice to a subject so vast as
Roman art, and we have therefore
embodied in it but a few of our personal
recollections. The deepest impressions,
however, can never be
told in words. No one who has
visited Rome can ever succeed in
fully expressing all his sentiments;
there are undefinable sensations that
will assert themselves, though the
visitor should strive to the utmost to
resist and stifle them; there are vivid
influences which are felt by the
infidel, the Puritan, and the Catholic
alike, though the first will not
acknowledge them, and the second
has too much human respect to
put them into tangible shape; still,
they exist none the less strongly
and may bear fruit when least expected.</p>

<p>Rome is too much of a landmark
in the tale of any traveller’s life to
be passed over in silence, and one
might say of its charm and influence
what Rousseau caused to be graven
on the pedestal of a statue of Eros
set up in his grounds near Geneva:</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Another</span> shrine most welcome to
all who have made a retreat in a
house of the Jesuits is the grotto of
Manresa. I went to Spain to visit
this holy spot. I was enchanted
with the wondrous appearance of
Montserrat, the most unique mountain,
perhaps, on the globe. It looks
like some enormous temple or Valhalla
built by the Scandinavians in
honor of their gods. Picture to
yourself a high table-land, and imagine
this surmounted by the Giant’s
Causeway (wherewith doubtless you
are familiar from the geography
plates), and this again crowned by
a multitude of icebergs or by colossal
models of the Milan Cathedral,
all forming a structure four
thousand feet in height and some
miles in extent, situated in a beautiful
country of rounded hills&mdash;the
Switzerland of Spain&mdash;which make
the great mountain more singular
and imposing by the contrast. You
may thus form an idea of Montserrat,
which the pious Catalonians say
was thus rent by the thunderbolts
of God at the Crucifixion. A famous
shrine of the Blessed Virgin
lies far up the mount; thirteen hermitages
formerly existed, but were
destroyed by the French revolutionists.
To the shrine of Mary the
converted Knight of Loyola repaired
for his general confession, and then,
retiring to an open cavern in the
side of a rocky hill, and having the
sublime mountain in view, he entered
on the famous retreat which resulted
in that great work, the <i>Spiritual
Exercises</i>. It was delightful to
say Mass in that cavern, preserved in
its original narrow nakedness, and
the Mass served by a gentleman
from New Granada, himself a pilgrim
to this holy place; to see the
same shelf of rock on which was
written that celebrated book praised
by so many popes, and which
worked such wonders in the perfecting
of soldiers in the spiritual warfare.
But the House of Retreat,
which still stands on the roof of that
rocky cavern, was changed from its
original purpose, and, having for a
while been used as a hospital, lies
now, since the expulsion of the Jesuits,
in empty desolation; its altar
literally stripped, its chapel in ruins,
its library scattered, its corridors
open to the elements. Here, at the
shrine to which all the novices of the
order in the noble church of Spain
used to come on foot to refresh their
spirit at the Mount of God, where
Ignatius had received a message
from on high, no one now remains
but a lay brother in secular dress,
who is allowed, by connivance of the
police, to sweep the church and care
for the chapels. Two other churches
of the society and their colleges
have now no trace of their possession;
and of two hundred Jesuits who
were formerly here, only three priests
and two lay brethren are left, living
on alms, and residing in a more
wretched lane than could be found
in New York.</p>

<p>No Jesuit, Dominican, Franciscan,
or other religious, can to-day
wear the dress of his order. Their
property was confiscated, their libraries
broken up; they are forbidden to
live in community or receive novices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[823]</a></span>
and no compensation is given them
for the means of living whereof they
were deprived. Such is a picture
of religious life in that once most
noble country, which controlled the
empire of the world when she was
most devoted to the church. In
conversing with a young ecclesiastic,
who guided me to the mean dwelling
of the Jesuits, up three pairs of
dark stairs, he said: “Every one notices
the decay of faith and increasing
corruption of morals, and all acknowledge
that the church militant
is practically weak when deprived of
the services of her religious orders.”
I might relate visits to other places,
and describe other peoples&mdash;tell you
of the Cathedral at Burgos, the
bearishness of some people I met,
the politeness characteristic of others,
the beauty of Switzerland, the fresh
simplicity of the Tyrol, the peculiar
charm of Venice, the prison of SS.
Peter and Paul at Rome, the Propaganda
College, and so on endlessly;
but I have only desired to illustrate
a little the pleasure of travel, not
to describe everything, which were
impossible. So great is the attraction
of travelling that a whole people,
the gypsies, spend their lives in
constant roaming over the world;
but their condition, like that of certain
classes in civilized communities,
shows abundantly that continual
wandering is conducive to advancement
neither in morals, learning, nor
real happiness.</p>

<p>Travellers for health, business, or
pleasure are not excluded from the
advantages sought by those who
travel expressly in pursuit of knowledge.
If one but keeps his head
cool and his temper quiet, he cannot
but pick up a great deal of useful
information during his sojourn
abroad. Indeed, so true is this that
a trip abroad has always been considered
the necessary finish to a
young man’s education; and I would
go so far as to say that no one can
pretend to the appellative of educated,
in its best sense, unless he has
travelled, or at least mingled with
the people and observed the institutions
of other nations. “The proper
study of mankind is man”; and it is
excellence in the knowledge of mankind,
after the knowledge of God and
of self, that constitutes learning. It
is not mathematics alone, nor yet languages,
nor skill in trades nor navigation:
it is to know our condition,
and capacity, and progress, and that
of other countries; to know what in
law and government is most conducive
to the social happiness, not simply
the material advancement; to
the eternal weal, not the temporal
aggrandizement only of our race.</p>

<p>The desire of increasing in knowledge,
as well as the pleasure the
sage finds in the pursuit of wisdom,
doubtless it was that sent our great
Secretary, Seward, in his white old
age, on a tour of the whole world.
It was this that made those collectors
of learned lore, Anacharsis and
Herodotus, leave their polished home-circles,
and travel amongst other
peoples. It is this that makes the
heirs of princely houses set out on
the tour of Europe and America, and
even Asia, on the completion of their
college course, that they may understand
their position amongst the
nations. It is this that brings the
acute and ambitious Japanese across
the globe in search of what is desirable
in our products; that they may
see the truth and value of institutions
different from their own.</p>

<p>In order to attain the object of
such a journey, we must observe
certain conditions. In the first
place, we should, if possible, know
some of the languages of the countries
through which we intend to
pass, or at least some which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[824]</a></span>
most likely be understood therein;
such as, for instance, the French in
Italy, Germany, etc., the Italian in
Spain, Greece, and Egypt. We are
otherwise necessitated to depend on
the mediation of a class often found
faithless in its duty of exact interpretation.
The interpreter, or <i>cicerone</i>,
is very likely to digest the information
he obtains or to qualify that
which he imparts according to the
supposed capacity or prejudice of
his employer; and, for fear of offending
one from whom he expects more
money, he will sometimes tell an
acceptable lie rather than an unwelcome
truth. Most unlucky is he
who is thus fed with the sweet poison
of falsehood rather than the
wholesome plainness of truth. What
can he gain by travel?</p>

<p>An Irish bishop, standing before
the picture of the martyrdom of SS.
Processus and Martinianus in the
Vatican, heard a young lady behind
ask her father what was the subject
of the painting. “That’s the Inquisition,
my dear; they are torturing
people in the Inquisition.” He looked
like a man who should know
how to read, and the name of the
picture was on the frame under it;
but it is quite possible that his information
came from a <i>cicerone</i>, as they
have been known to give it just as
false and malicious.</p>

<p>In the second place, the traveller
must bear in mind that his own nation
does not monopolize the goodness
or common sense of the world,
and that, however unintelligible or
absurd the customs of other countries
may appear to him, the presumption
is in their favor; hence, he
must never ridicule anything, never
judge rashly, but wait till his ignorance
is removed and his little experience
enlarged to the knowledge
of many excellent things that he
dreamt not of before, remembering
that, while it is pardonable in children
and peculiar to boors to laugh
at a strange dress or a foreign custom,
it is unworthy of an educated
person. We should never be
ashamed to learn, nor therefore to
ask questions. Benjamin Franklin
(or Dr. Johnson) said it was by this
means he gained so much information.
A doctor should be no more
ashamed to ask a farmer about potatoes
than he to ask him about pills.
Every man should be supposed to
know his own trade better than
others not of it. It is the folly of
supposing themselves all-wise and
others know-nothings, that keeps
many men bigoted and ignorant.</p>

<p>Finally, a great secret for acquiring
knowledge of strange peoples
and understanding their ways is contained
in that advice to “put yourself
in their place.” We will find
that, if we were in their place, we
would do just the same, or perhaps
would not have done so well as we
find them doing, and it will prevent
us forming very wrong impressions
of a government or a people. For
instance, when travelling in France,
we were subjected to some inconvenience
by the police regulations,
and were tempted to think these
French a narrow-minded, suspicious,
timid people, until some one reminded
the rest of the surveillance our government
had felt itself constrained to
exercise on the line of the Potomac,
the suspension of the Habeas Corpus,
and the imprisonment of editors
under our own flag; and we
were persuaded that France was
also excusable, filled as she was with
the adherents of three contending
political parties, and her territory
in part occupied by a conqueror.
When we notice something apparently
inconvenient, we must wait
and see what is the corresponding
advantage. Thus, one may dislike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[825]</a></span>
the brick and marble floors of Italy.
Let him wait till summer, and he
will like them; or let him reflect on
the immunity from conflagrations
which is due to them, and then say
if the adoption of this flooring instead
of wood is not a cheap price to
pay for safety. “During a residence
of thirty-five years in Florence, I
know not a single house to have
been burnt.” This is what Hiram
Powers, the sculptor, testifies. In
like manner, Dickens was not very
much taken with the narrow streets
and peculiar build of Genoa the
Superb, yet he adds: “I little
thought that in one year I would
love the very stones of the streets
of Genoa.” When he reached Switzerland
on his return home, he was
no doubt pleased with the neatness
of the people, etc.; but still ...
“the beautiful Italian manners, the
sweet language, the quick recognition
of a pleasant look or cheerful
word, the captivating expression of
a desire to oblige in everything, are
left behind the Alps. Remembering
them, I sighed for the dirt again,
the brick floors, bare walls, unplastered
ceilings, and broken windows.”</p>

<p>One of the great advantages we
Americans, just as others, gain by
travelling is improvement in self-knowledge,
which is the foundation-stone
of wisdom&mdash;beginning to look
at ourselves as it were from a distance,
and to see ourselves as we
are seen by others. It is the great
profit of this that made the poet
exclaim:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Oh! wad some power the giftie gie us<br />
To see oursels as ithers see us!</p>
<p class="pp6i">It wad frae mony a blunder free us,<br />
And foolish notion.”</p>

<p class="p1">When we compare the institutions
of foreign lands and their results with
our own, we learn a juster appreciation
of each, and to remedy the defects
of our own, if need be. On the
one hand, the nothingness of the individual
in many parts of Continental
Europe, and the “everythingness”
of the state, is very intolerable. The
way, too, the police stare at every one
in France, as if you had a suspicious
look, while the people side with the
officer, not apparently from love of
the law, but out of fear, just as all
the school-boys quake when one is
subjected to the pedagogue’s scrutiny.
I was in France during Napoleon’s
despotism, and now under
the republic, and it seemed to me
that to the people it was all one;
they fear whoever is in power. On
landing at Calais, our names were
peremptorily demanded, as if the nation
feared the entrance of some
certain individuals who were only
known to it by name. I guess such
persons would hardly give their
names in such a case. In Ireland,
so little respect is had for the people
that they are not trusted with arms;
but, to keep a gun, one must have a
written license from the agents of
the inexorable government. Then,
in most of those countries, the huge
barracks of the standing armies,
swallowing up hundreds of thousands
of strong, healthy youth, and
corrupting the morals of the district
wherein they are stationed, seemed
to insult the people, and to say: “If
you don’t be quiet, we’ll cut you to
pieces.” And then again their officers
strut along in idleness, or kill time
by balls, parties, and cricket-playing,
while the masses are sweating to
support them, or dying in the poor-houses,
worn out in the struggle for
existence. Of course, there is some
palliation for this. The governments
of Europe are afraid of each
other, and many of them are afraid
of their people, too. God grant
that we may never fear a foreign
foe, or, what is worse, have a government
or laws which the people
do not love! But if it is insulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[826]</a></span>
to our manhood to be forbidden to
keep arms, it is certainly wrong for
us to allow every ruffian to have his
loaded revolver always in his pocket.
It is worse to have a statute forbidding
the carriage of concealed weapons,
and not to enforce it.</p>

<p>From the exactness wherewith the
public honor is guarded and the
criminal laws administered in England&mdash;one
of those circumstances
which make her paper pass as gold in
any part of the world&mdash;we may learn
to correct some of our insane, suicidal
looseness in these respects at
home, which is destroying all security
for life and property, and making
us a by-word among the nations.
When we see the learning,
maturity, and integrity required for
the judgeship in other lands, we begin
to see how wrong it is to render
competition for this high station subject
to the bribery of low politicians,
whereby, as we all know, men who
should be punished as criminals are
sometimes found seated on the
bench. O my friends! if you but
knew what ridicule and contempt for
democratic institutions some of these
things cause in Europe! It is for
this that many excellent persons look
with horror on their approach, and
cannot appreciate their worth or
beauty when they behold these, howsoever
accidental, results of their
working. Often had we to try and
correct unfavorable impressions arising
from the fact of known swindlers
being allowed to flourish amongst us,
and to ruin our public credit by their
gambling speculations or bribery;
and when one of them is, out of private
and lawless revenge, murdered
by another, how uncertain it is
whether the criminal shall be hanged
or restored to society! When they
see how we assemble to hear lectures
from women divorced from
their husbands, and shamelessly living
with a paramour, while professing
Christian ministers bless such a
union, associated though it be with
adultery and murder, is it a wonder
that Europeans should not increase
in their respect for democracy?
But the American abroad rouses from
the lethargy which the commonness
of these things throws over him at
home; and to see the disorder as
others see it is the first step toward
reform. God grant it come not too
late!</p>

<p>Until one goes abroad, he is apt to
imagine that no country enjoys as
much liberty in any sense as our own,
and that, how objectionable soever
some of our practices may appear,
still the corresponding ones in Europe
must be intolerably more so.
How surprised we are, for instance,
when, having encountered the gentlemanly
custom-house regulations
of England, France, and other nations,
the politeness of whose officers
is often greater than you often
meet with here even in persons who
expect to gain by your visit, we return
home, and are confronted with
the hostile demonstrations of our New
York institution! At Liverpool, the
officer approaches, and, with a single
glance at your appearance, frequently
puts the chalk cross on your baggage;
or gently asks if you have anything
dutiable, and takes your word for an
answer; or, at most, slightly examines
your baggage, and almost begs pardon
for the trouble he is giving. In
France likewise, only that you are
asked to open your valise, “if you
please,” and thanked afterwards.
How different in our supposed free
atmosphere! Every traveller, citizen
or alien, is obliged to sign a
statement, liable to be confirmed with
an oath, to the effect that he carries
nothing dutiable, not even a present
for his wife or sister; and then his
baggage is examined as if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[827]</a></span>
made no declaration at all. If the
examination is to follow, the oath is
unnecessary and therefore sinful. If
the oath is accepted as true testimony,
is it not insulting to examine,
as if it were not believed, or as if the
government wished to detect people
in perjury. I read the experience of
a priest in a Holland custom-house,
where the officer insultingly took a
crucifix&mdash;an image of the crucified
Son of God!&mdash;out of the valise, and,
holding it on high, asked him what it
was! In Alexandria of Egypt, they
examined his person, pocket, and
sounded his stomach, so that he cried
out: “What! Is it contraband to
have a stomach? Is there any particular
size fixed for it? Are there
any duties to be paid on it?” At
least there was no tampering with an
oath in these cases. Such excesses
are blamable anywhere, but they are
intolerable in a republic.</p>

<p>Another contrast unfavorable to us
is the independence of the traveller,
at least in this regard: in Continental
Europe, no man has to stand
even in an omnibus; while here, not
only in the street-cars, where it may
be explained, but often on the cars
of some of our principal railroads, you
must stand in travelling. The lawful
number of places is marked in
Europe, and the people behave as if
they were what we claim to be&mdash;“individual
sovereigns”; if one man is
without a seat, the company must
either find him one or put on an
extra car. Far different from us, who
seem to be the slaves of monopoly,
or “dead-heads” under a compliment,
so that we dare not open our
mouths.</p>

<p>When we see how the people of
Europe enjoy life, and lengthen their
days, and increase their innocent pleasures
by moderation in seeking after
wealth, by observing occasional holidays,
by popular amusements, foot
and boatracing, coursing, holding
cricket-matches open to the public
(free of charge, just as the rest of the
sports in Great Britain), we begin to
feel how absurd it is for us to be
burning out our brains at forty years
of age, to break down our bodies by
excessive labor, heaping up riches
which we thus inhibit ourselves from
enjoying, to rush through our work
as if we were laying up capital for a
thousand years, instead of for ten,
twenty, or thirty. By experience of
all these things we find that we have
much to learn and to improve; and
while, on the one hand, we feel our
own advantages, we are convinced,
on the other, that it was a very silly
saying, that of the schoolboy:
“That no one should stay in Europe
now, since it is so easy to come to
America.”</p>

<p>The non-Catholic is disabused of
his prejudices by going abroad and
finding Catholic institutions so different
from what he had been led by
his training to expect; and their
journey to Rome in particular used
formerly to lead many an educated
person to the truth. An English
lady of high rank and great repute
in her day said to Cardinal Pacca,
the celebrated minister of Pius VII.,
“There is one thing in your system
which I cannot possibly get over, it
is so cruel and shocking.” “What
is it that so excites your ladyship’s indignation?”
“Your Inquisition. I
have been told all kinds of terrible
things about it&mdash;its punishments, its
tortures, and, in fact, all kinds of
abominations.” The cardinal endeavored
to remove from the lady’s
mind the absurd notions which fiction
and calumny had associated
with the very harmless institution of
modern times; but his success was
not altogether complete. “Well,”
said he, “would your ladyship wish
to see the head of this dreaded tribunal?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[828]</a></span>”
“Above all things; and
I should be most grateful to you
for affording me the opportunity.”
“Then you had better come here on
such an evening (which he named),
and you shall see this tremendous
personage, and you can then judge
of the institution from its chief.”
The lady was true to her appointment,
all anxiety for her promised
interview with the grand inquisitor.
The cardinal, who was alone at the
time of her arrival, received his visitor
with his usual courtly manner,
and engaged her in conversation on
the various matters of the day. The
lady soon became <i>distrait</i>, and at
length said: “Your eminence will
pardon me, but you led me to expect
that you were to gratify a woman’s
curiosity.” “How was that, my
lady?” “Why, don’t you remember
you assured me I was to see the
Grand Inquisitor of the Holy Office?”
“Certainly, and you have
seen him,” the cardinal said, in the
quietest possible manner. “Seen
him!” exclaimed the lady, looking
round the apartment. “I see no one
but yourself, cardinal.” “Quite true,
my child; I did promise you that you
should meet the head of the tribunal
of which you have been told such
wonderful tales; and I have kept
my word, for in me you behold your
grand inquisitor! From what you
know of him, you may judge of the
institution.” “You, cardinal&mdash;you
the inquisitor! Well, I am surprised!”
Her ladyship might have added:
“And converted, too,” which she
was.</p>

<p>The Catholic is confirmed in his
faith when he witnesses the piety of
Ireland and Belgium; sees the wealth,
position, and learning of the children
of the church in other nations.
When he visits the chapter-house in
the Abbey of Westminster, where,
under the wings of the church, the
House of Commons long held its sessions,
the testimony of its mute walls
does more to convince him of the
stand of the church in regard to free
institutions than all that has been
written on the subject. When he
beholds, in the famous College of
the Propaganda, students of every
color, tongue, and clime, united in
prayer and study, preparing to
preach the one same faith in every
land, he realizes what he had always
held by faith&mdash;the Catholicity of the
church&mdash;and he understands and
feels what some one has expressed:
“Elsewhere we believe, but in Rome
we see.” Even from the practice of
heretics he takes a lesson of attachment
to his church; and when he
sees how Protestants in Ireland, to
avoid the contact with Catholics
which they consider dangerous to
their belief, support schools of their
own all the while they are taxed for
the national education, he feels still
more the wisdom of the Catholic
prelates in condemning mixed education.</p>

<p>The public man of our country,
the member of the legislature, the
priest, finds much to learn in the customs
which centuries have sanctioned;
and thus the experience of
each supplies the want of this important
and all-testing article at home.
He sees by the condition of Switzerland,
Bavaria, the south and west
of France, etc., that people are just
as prosperous, as happy and healthy,
without the machines and various
inventions on which we are apt to
pride ourselves; while his visit to
English manufacturing towns will
make him slow to place much trust
in institutions which have generated
so much mental weakness and
bodily disease; have tended so much
to destroy the liberty and independence
of the people by eliminating
the private tradesman and creating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
vast tyrannous monopolies; and have,
by their very circumstances and discipline,
occasioned such an increase
of immorality in populations heretofore
uncorrupted. Having observed
them in their homes, he understands
better the circumstances and motives
which influence men of different nationality
and religion, and is enabled
to form a more correct judgment of
our adopted citizens, no matter from
what land. When he sees the misery
of the Irish people at home&mdash;a consequence
of English misrule&mdash;he can
better understand why they take refuge
in the delusive cup, deprived as
they are by their poverty of the commonest
conveniences and much more
of the purer pleasures of life; nay, he
is even astonished to find that, with
the unspeakable wretchedness of the
people, they are so honest that, in
the maritime city of Cork, the doors
are often scarce more than latched;
and so wanting in cool, calculating
malice that, with all the strictness of
the English, and with judges like
Keogh, it is forty years since a man
has been found guilty of wilful murder
in that handsome town. Even
the agrarian outrages are mitigated
to our view when we consider that
they partake of the “wild justice of
revenge,” and the political disturbances
have their spring of action in
one of the noblest aspirations of the
human soul. He is even disposed to
pity rather than condemn or despise
the Irish when they here become the
tools of infamous politicians; reflecting
how easily explained this is in
the case of country people, such as
most of them are (not one in five
of whom ever voted before or entered
a town except on a fair day),
suddenly exalted to the comparative
wealth of the American laborer, to
the lordly exercise of political rights,
and exposed to the new and captivating
influences of a great capital.
But when the American traveller
meets the city people of Ireland, and
learns to respect their justice, intelligence,
and urbanity; when he sees
what a dutiful, sober, conscientious
man the Irish peasant can be, as
exemplified in the constabulary, of
whom I always heard their priests and
all travellers speak in the highest
terms, he will look kindly on the
faults of the emigrant, in the sure expectation
that, when his novitiate is
passed, he will stand in the first rank
of the citizens of the republic.</p>

<p>It will be a pleasure for me, and I
trust may not be unacceptable to the
reader, if I digress slightly here as I
touch on this subject of the Irish
people. Having Irish blood in my
own veins, I naturally had a great
sympathy with the country, especially
after hearing the voice of Catholic
Ireland crying in our American
wilderness so eloquently, and was
delighted when, on the 21st of June,
her shores rose from the sea in all
the charm of sunlight, balmy and
verdant freshness, like Venus from
the deep. From four in the morning,
we had that long-desired land in
view, and all day long our eyes feasted
on its charms, as we stopped to
land passengers and buy fresh meat,
entertained by the beautiful Cove of
Cork and the magic shores adjacent;
and, when the full moon mirrored her
beauty in the calm Atlantic, we enjoyed
the spectacle at midnight of
departing light in the west and the
first faint streaks of day in the east.
It was such a day and such a night
as one might well go three thousand
miles to enjoy. I do not wish to
speak of the scenery of the country;
that is well enough known. I only
desire to testify to my experience of
the people.</p>

<p>Nearly six months we dwelt in the
fair city of Cork, one of the most
beautifully situated I ever beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span>
and I never by any accident heard
profane or obscene language in this
town of ninety thousand inhabitants.
Who could walk New York for a
week, and relate such an experience?
I was edified by the venerable presence
of the faith in this people, as
fresh and strong as ever to-day. You
might compare it to a flourishing
young oak that springs out from the
body of an old, and furrowed, and
blasted trunk, itself as beauteous as
if it did not come from such ancient
roots, and were not vegetating with
the self-same inextinguished life of
the patriarchal tree. How much to
the honor of the nation that she has
transmitted without a break the consecration
which the hands of Patrick,
Malachy, and Laurence laid upon
her hierarchy, while neighboring
people have been obliged to send
abroad for pastoral unction! It is
most edifying to see the congregations
at Mass, and to hear the loud
murmur of faith and adoration at the
elevation of the Host. It is beautiful
to see them stop at the church
to pay a visit of a minute as they
pass on their way to work, or at
least to take the holy water at
the door. Drivers, policemen, men
cleaning the streets, all classes are seen
to do this. I was coming out of a
church one day in winter, and found
a child’s maid with a child in her
arms, kneeling in the damp, wet
porch, praying. “Why don’t you
go inside? ‘Tis quite wet here,” I
said. “I was afraid the child would
make too much noise, sir!” It was
a week-day, and there were only a
few persons inside.</p>

<p>The good, simple, peaceable man
of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> is found
in Ireland. I met one of these&mdash;a
learned, pious, prudent priest, yet as
simple in worldly ways as a child,
and amusingly ignorant of our modern
progress, but courageous as a
martyr when called on in court for
testimony involving his priestly character.
I met another man, a layman,
a pure Celt, strong and vigorous,
eighty years of age, simple in
his diet and dress, speaking English
poorly, but Irish fluently and well;
he walked at sixty years of age as
many miles in three days; and when
at last his son, a man of twenty-three,
got tired, he took him on his back,
and kept on. Such a man might
Abraham have been. No wonder
his parish priest said to him before
me: “I’m glad to see you, James.
I hope to see you often, and that
you may live long to inspire and encourage
me and our people by your
example!” His daughter died in
Lawrence, Mass., and thus the grandson
wrote to the old man at home:
“Mother asked for the holy water,
and washed her face with it, and
sprinkled us, blessing us. She then
directed that her body should be
carried to the grave on the shoulders
of her own flesh and blood, and asked
us to turn her face to the east.
We turned her, and we thought she
had gone asleep, but it was the long
sleep of death!” Such is Irish faith.
These people are most edifyingly
patient and cheerful in sickness and
misery. They never complain, but
always say, “‘Tis the will of God.”
In Waterford, one awful, snowy day,
I was much struck by this dialogue
between two old persons: “How
are you, Mary?” “Oh! then, pretty
well, Denis, only I have the rheumatics.”
“Oh! then, ‘tis God’s will;
and you can’t complain, as you’re
able to be about!” My friends, if
you had the wretched rags that she
and he had on, and their probably
empty stomachs, I think you would
have been neither inclined to preach
nor disposed to practise resignation.
I never, by any accident, met any
one so ill-clad here as I saw there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[831]</a></span>
Even in the snow they had no shoes
nor underclothing.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder, then, that the
great spirit of Montalembert was inflamed
by visiting such a country?
As Mrs. Oliphant says in her <i>Memoir</i>,
“He had seen a worshipping nation,
and his imagination had been inspired
by the sight, and all his resolutions
had burst into flower.”</p>

<p>Another spectacle that entertained
us here was that of an artless maiden.
Such a treat for an American!
To see a girl of eighteen or twenty
years so modest and artless in her
ways. There is a charm about such
an one; she seems God’s fairest work,
as an honest man is his noblest.
At the convent schools in Ireland
one notices the same gentleness,
which contrasts beautifully with what
we have so much of at home, and
that feature of which Shakespeare
says, speaking of Perdita:</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">“... Her voice was ever soft,</p>
<p class="pp4">Gentle, and low&mdash;an excellent thing in woman.”</p>

<p class="p1">I heard an American express his
notion of it characteristically by saying:
“How quick these girls would
find a husband in America!” An
English writer, speaking of a city
which was remarkably Irish, though
not in Ireland, first indulges in some
of his usual pokes and jokes about
its inhabitants, and then says: “Nowhere
did I ever meet better bred
ladies”; and a lady well acquainted
with the high society of one of our
sister cities told me that the ladies
in Ireland were far better educated.
Indeed, the love of education is very
great amongst the Irish people.</p>

<p>I never saw finer schools than
those of the Christian Brothers in
Cork, and all supported by the voluntary
contributions of the people,
without a cent from the government,
and in a very poor country. Although
a poor Protestant is rare in
Ireland, the statistics of the Dublin
census for 1872 show that the number
of illiterates amongst the Catholics
is smaller than amongst the adherents
of any other religious denomination.
And still people will talk of the
ignorant Irish, and the opposition of
the priests to education! The ignorance,
whatever it is, of the Irish, like
the rags that hang on their limbs, is
a sad but glorious sign of their
fidelity to God’s truth! If they had
wished to sell their heavenly treasure,
they might have got the mess
of pottage called godless education.
All honor to them and to their priests
for the inestimable value they place
on the deposit of faith handed down
by saints and scholars! There is a
good deal of carelessness and want
of enterprise amongst the Irish people,
no doubt; but as for the former,
as F. Burke says: “God help
us! Much they’ve left us to be
careless with.” The less a man has,
the more thriftless he is likely to be.
Having in this country a sure title
to his own and a prospect of success,
I maintain that the Irishman will become
as thrifty, without being niggardly,
as any other citizen.</p>

<p>Their wit is proverbial, their good-nature
under all circumstances most
remarkable. In Kilkenny, one Sunday,
I saw a party in miserable
uniform marching about playing
rather unskilfully on a few musical
instruments, and calling themselves
a band. A crowd followed them
through the wet, snow-covered streets,
and continually assailed the musicians
and each other indifferently
with snow-balls. A policeman standing
on a corner got one behind his
ear, but, like most of the rest, laughed
and made nothing of it. Imagine a
New York M. P. under similar circumstances!
On one occasion, I
watched a group of men bantering
a rather old seaman who complained
of toothache; one suggested that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span>
should take a sup of cold water, and
sit on the fire until it boiled; another
advised him to hang his night-cap
on the bed-post, and, mixing a little
whiskey and hot water, etc., should
drink until he saw two night-caps; a
third said the best thing was to tie
the tooth to a tree, and run away
from it. He heard them all very
good-humoredly, but simply remarked,
as if it were not worth while now at
his time of life to learn cures: “Faix,
I can’t have many more o’ them.”</p>

<p>A jolly, witty, careless bachelor
lived on his own property in Blackpool.
His houses were two; that
which he occupied was open to the
weather, and the adjoining one
looked as if it had been burned. It
was a complete ruin. They were in
such a state that some friend remarked
that they were likely to fall
in and bury him. “Faith,” said the
poor lonely bachelor, “‘twould be
the best thing that could happen me,
if I was prepared.” We must repeat
here the story of an Irish Protestant,
who went to church with his Catholic
friend. His surprise at the strange
sights and sounds soon got the better
of him, and he whispered: “Why,
Pat, this beats the very ould divil.”
“That’s the intention,” said Pat, and
kept on blessing himself all the same.</p>

<p>Americans, who are not taxed to
support a foreign despotic master,
who have a sure and enduring title
to their property, and who stand or
fall by their own free, unimpeded
efforts, sometimes wonder at the
want of enterprise, neatness, and
care of the Irish people. But a visit
to the country and a look into its
circumstances explain why this is
the case. The man who feels that
his house may be taken from him
to-morrow is not likely to spend
much on its decoration; the father
who knows that his children are destined
to the lowest servitude is even
tempted to be careless about sending
them to school, and no doubt reprehensible
habits which may take several
generations to eradicate are naturally
formed in such a condition of things.
I have said enough, however, to show&mdash;and
a visit to Ireland, combined
with a knowledge of her people under
a free and favorable government,
will convince us&mdash;that these faults of
some of the Irish are their misfortune
rather than their natural character,
and that, when they are free from the
iron shackles of a barbarous conqueror,
they will shine forth in all the
virtues which adorn a great Catholic
nation.</p>

<p>All the advantages undoubtedly
derivable from going abroad are
attended with a danger which sometimes
overtakes men of limited education
and small mind, and which
experience teaches we are all obliged
to guard against. Contact with the
institutions of most parts of Europe
has a tendency to undermine the
simple, independent qualities of the
republican. The splendor of the
throne, the tinsel of rank, the worship
of mammon, family pride, etc.,
by which the sterling worth of the
individual is overlooked and individual
virtue is disregarded for the
glitter which often covers the rottenness
and impurity of caste&mdash;all these
appeal temptingly to the wealthy
but otherwise undistinguished American.
His daughters are sought in
marriage by members of broken-down
princely houses, because they
have money; his sons are courted
by noble gamblers, because they are
rich; and I need not tell why it is
that principle in these cases is often
sacrificed to that base tendency of
our fallen nature which makes us
aspire to power, rank, and title, just
as a little boy does to the possession
of a whip, a sash, and a cocked hat.</p>

<p>I recall now the case of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[833]</a></span>
our American admirals, who, when
patriotic New Hampshire objected
to changing the Indian names of
our men-of-war to Saxon ones, defended
his action by saying: “He did not
see why England should have all
the fine names.” The poor man
was actually so infatuated by the
style, pretension, and wealth of England
that he thought even the stale
nomenclature of her vessels preferable
to the fresh, historically endeared
ones taken from our native land&mdash;a
piece of weakness and folly which
drew out the merited protest of the
Granite State, which had given some
of those fine old Indian names to
ships that under them gained glory
in war, and won admiration and
respect when they visited the coasts
of Europe. Imagine exchanging
such names as Tuscarora, Niagara,
Oneida, for such ones as Vixen,
Hornet, Viper, Spitfire, or even for
Hector, Ajax, and Captain! It
were unjust, however, to the rude
health of our republican atmosphere
to suppose that weakness such as
this can be called characteristic of
those nurtured on our soil, and were
conclusive against hope in the perpetuity
of our institutions. Such
exceptional and deplorable examples
need not make us fear the consequences
of travel to the majority of travellers.
The really educated, reflecting
man knows the lessons of
history too well to be deceived by
the glitter of such institutions, which,
like the <i>ignis fatuus</i> itself, is a token of
the underlying rottenness. The religious
man feels deeply that, while
obedience to authority is essential to
all government, still modesty and
simplicity have given life and vigor,
while pride and luxury have been
the bane and caused the death of
nations; and he knows that the
conscientious, willing adhesion of the
democrat to the laws he has had an
influence in making is more trustworthy,
as it is more noble, than the
abject, servile submission of the slave,
disgusting to God, as well as dishonorable
to his image. The priest cannot
but feel deeply that the only
system and the only land which
allows the church to stand or fall by
her own strength and merits is
America; and his consciousness of
her increasing prosperity, in contrast
to her maimed and bleeding condition
in other lands, must only attach
him still more to his country
and her institutions. And while he
adverts, as I have done, to her faults,
and wishes her to take pattern by
the virtues and warning by the sins
of other nations, it is because his
heart as well as his interest are bound
up with her fate:</p>

exquisite delight, prompt us, with the

<p>I remember, when out on the broad
Atlantic, with the monotonous waste
of waters in every direction, to have
noticed something in the kiss of the
sunbeams, in the familiar sweetness of
the air, denoting the nearness of home
by these embraces, so to speak, of our
own clime. The lifting up of the
heart, the light gladness of the spirits
that succeeded, were not even due
to the thought of home and friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[834]</a></span>
The magic influence of atmosphere

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c834" id="c834">CHARTRES.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> is the hour of pilgrimages.
Probably never since the middle
ages were they so numerous, or, with
regard to the public ones, so carefully
organized as at the present
time; whether to the favored localities
to which in these latter days
heavenly manifestations have been
accorded, or to the ancient sanctuaries
whose history is coeval with
that of the whole Christian era.</p>

<p>At this moment, when a vast concourse
of pilgrims from various parts
of France, and especially from its
capital, are gone to pay their
homage to our Lady of Chartres,
and beg her intercession on behalf
of their country, it may not be
uninteresting to some among our
readers if we endeavor briefly to
trace the history of this celebrated
shrine.</p>

<p>On entering the richly sculptured
entrance&mdash;too large to be called a
porch, and too truly Gothic to be
called a portico&mdash;of the church of
S. Germain l’Auxerrois in Paris, the
visitor is struck with the beauty of
the ancient frescos with which its
interior is adorned; so effective in
composition, so spiritual in expression,
and in execution so delicate,
simple, and refined. In one of these,
which fills the tympanum of a closed
arch forming part of the north side,
is depicted the form of a venerable,
white-bearded sage, who might without
difficulty serve to represent a
Druid (though in all probability it is
the prophet Isaias), kneeling, with
an expression of wonder and joy on
his aged countenance, while an angel,
opening a window, shows him a
distant vision of the Virgin Mother
and her divine Son.</p>

<p>The connection between the subject
of this fresco and that of the
present article will shortly be apparent.
The ancient city, which was
formerly the capital of the Carnutes,
claims the honor of having been the
first in the world to consecrate a
temple to the Blessed Virgin.</p>

<p>Chartres, before the Christian era
dawned upon the earth, foresaw from
the midnight darkness the shining
of the “Morning Star” which should
precede its rising, and by anticipation
did homage to the Virgin who was
to bring forth&mdash;<i>Virgini Parituræ</i>.</p>

<p>It was previous to the subjugation
of the Gauls by the Roman arms
that this homage began. They were
still a free, wild, and haughty race;
<i>Mala gens</i>, according to the <i>Commentaries</i>
of their conqueror; living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
little in their towns, much in
their pathless forests; they are, moreover,
by the same author reported to
be a religious people; that is to say,
submissive to their priests, from
whom they had not only their faith,
but also their laws and government.</p>

<p>These priests were the Druids. If
old Armorica was the cradle of their
worship, it is no less true that it had
at a very early period spread not
only into Britain, but also over the
whole of Gaul, establishing at Chartres
the central point of its continental
empire. There the solemn sacrifices
were offered, and there were
held the tribunals of justice; <i>in loco
consecrato</i>,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> which expression, by a
slight variation, might fittingly be
rendered, <i>in luco consecrato</i>, considering
the veneration in which woods
and groves were held, and that it
was in these that the assemblies met.</p>

<p>Not until after the Roman invasion
was polytheism gradually and
with difficulty engrafted on the more
primitive Druidic worship, which was
evidently neither of Greek nor Latin
origin, but rather the offspring of
Egypt or Chaldea, with occasional
indications of affinity with the belief
of the Hebrews. The Galli and
Cymri had originally come from the
East, being alike descendants of
Gomer, the son of Japhet.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>As some writers have imagined
the Egyptian cross in the form of
the Greek <i>Τ</i>, the <i>signum vitæ futuræ</i>,
to have proved the expectation
among that nation of the coming of
the Messias, so others have seen in
the venerated mistletoe attached to
the oak an image of the Redeemer
on the cross, and in the offerings of
bread and wine a foreshadowing of
the sacrament of the altar. In any
case, these were but vague notions or
veiled presentiments of truths of
which Israel alone possessed the certainty;
yet some stray gleam from
the light of Hebrew prophecy may
have shown to others than the chosen
people a faint and distant vision
of that great second Mother of the
human race who should repair the
ills brought on it by the first.</p>

<p>According to the oldest traditions,
it was a hundred years before the
birth of our Saviour that this expectation
manifested itself in a public
manner among the Druids of the
Carnutes, by the consecration of a
grotto, for a long time previous famous
among them, to the “Virgin
who was to bring forth.”</p>

<p>No written document of equal antiquity
to this epoch exists in support
of the tradition; nor would it be
possible, from the fact that the Druids
committed nothing to writing, but
transmitted the doctrines of their religion
and the facts of history solely
by oral teaching.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Chartres, however,
from the time of its foundation
by the Blessed Aventinus, who is
said to have been the disciple of S.
Peter, faithfully guarded the memory
of an event which was its peculiar
glory, by consigning the history
thereof to its archives. These were
carefully consulted by the Abbé Sébastien
Rouillard, especially a very
ancient chronicle which was translated
from Latin into French in 1262,
during the reign of S. Louis, and of
which he gives the following account,
although, in rendering it into English,
we lose the charm of the quaint
original: “Wherefore the Druids
having arrived at this last centenary
which immediately preceded the
birth of Our Lord, ... the said
Druids being assembled together by
the revolution of the new year to
perform their accustomed ceremonies
for gathering in the mistletoe,
which, coming from heaven and attaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[836]</a></span>
itself to oaks and divers
other trees, was a figure of the Messias;
at that time, in the assembly
of the aforesaid Druids, all being
vested in their mantles of white wool,
after their custom, in the presence
of Priscus, King of Chartres, and of
the princes, lords, and other estates
of the province, the Archdruid, having
made the sacrifice of bread and
wine according to custom, and praying
the God of heaven that the sacrifice
aforesaid might be salutary to
all the people of the Carnutes, declared
that the divine inbreathing
(afflatus) with which he felt himself
filled so greatly overpowered him as
well-nigh to take away the power of
speech, causing his heart to beat with
vehement blows, and overwhelming
it with extraordinary joy, seeing
that he had to announce, by the
revolution of the new century, the
presage of her approach who should
restore the golden age, and bring
forth Him for whom the nations
waited.” “Wherefore, O heaven! is
thy tardy movement slower than the
longing of my desires?... If
old age, which has brought my steps
to the brink of the grave, forbids me
to behold with my own eyes that
which I foresee, nevertheless I render
thanks, O Deity Supreme, to
thee, who hast inspired our sacred
college with its expectation. In the
midst of this grotto, and hard by this
well, shall be raised an altar and an
image to the Virgin who shall bring
forth a Son. And do ye, princes and
lords here present, declare whether
this thing is pleasing to you.” Thus
spoke the pontiff, while tears rolled
down his long white beard. The
whole assembly, being seized with a
spirit of joy and devotion, eagerly corresponded
with the desires of its high-priest.
The altar was raised and the
image dedicated&mdash;<i>Virgini Parituræ</i>.</p>

<p>The place where this solemn assembly
was held is none other than
the hill whereon now stands the Cathedral
of Chartres. At that period,
a thick wood surrounded the grotto,
which resembled the <i>Grottes des Fées</i>
still to be seen in many secluded
country-places in France, and which
were not unfrequently the abodes
of Druidesses, the remembrance of
whom is preserved under this popular
appellation.</p>

<p>We have here, according to this
tradition, the most ancient pilgrimage,
which was Christian in spirit
before being so in reality. The
other Druidic virgins, venerated in
various places, as at Nogent, Longpont,
and Châlons-sur-Marne, were
all later and in imitation of the Virgin
of Chartres.</p>

<p>The consecrated grotto in time
became the crypt of the mediæval
cathedral which now in all its majestic
beauty rises above it. The
original building, in consequence of
various catastrophes, changed its
form, and was more than once renewed
before obtaining its present
splendor; but the Druidic image has
invariably remained in the locality
first assigned to it, whither all the
centuries of Christian times have
successively sent multitudes of pilgrims
to do homage to <i>Notre Dame
de Soubs Terre</i>, and whither we
must go to find the copy which has
replaced the ancient and venerable
effigy, destroyed, not yet a century
ago, by sacrilegious hands, which, in
the time of the great Revolution,
tore it from its sanctuary and threw
it into the flames. The present
image is a faithful reproduction of
the Druidic one, of which a minute
description is given in a chronological
<i>History of Chartres</i>, written in the
XVIth century. The Virgin Mother
is enthroned, with her son upon her
knees, whose right hand is raised in
benediction, while in the left he holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[837]</a></span>
the globe of the world. Over the
Virgin’s robe is a mantle in form of
a dalmatic; her head is covered with
a veil, surmounted by a crown, of
which the ornaments somewhat resemble
the leaves of the ash. Her
countenance is extremely well formed,
oval, dark, and shining, and the
whole figure has much resemblance
to the ancient Byzantine type. With
regard to the supposed reasons for
the color of the complexion, we will
quote the words of Sébastien Rouillard:</p>

<p>“La dite image des Druides est de
couleur mauresque, comme presque
toutes les aultres de l’Eglise de
Chartres. Ce que l’on estime avoir
été fait par les Druides et aultres à
leur suitte, sur la présomptive couleur
du peuple oriental, exposé plus que
nous aux ardeurs du soleil, cause
que l’Espouse du Cantique des Cantiques
dit que le soleil l’a découlourée,
et que pour être brune, elle ne
laisse d’être belle. Néantmoins Nicephore
qui avait vue plusieurs
tableaux de cette Vierge faicte par
Saint Luc après le naturel, dit que la
couleur de son visage estoit <i>sitochroë</i>,
ou de couleur de froument. Si ce
n’est qu’on veuille dire que le froument
estant meur tire sur le brun ou
couleur de chastaigne.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The remainder of the description
is so charming that we cannot refrain
from finishing the portrait:</p>

<p>“La Vierge estoit de stature médiocre....
Ses cheveux tiraient sur
l’or; ses yeux estoient acres et estincellans,
aiant les prunelles jaunastres
et de couleur d’olive, ses sourcils cambrez
en forme d’arcade, et d’une
couleur noire leur avenant fort bien.
Son nez estoit longuet, ses lèvres
vives et flories, sa face non ronde ni
aiguë, mais un peu longuette, les
mains et les doigts pareillement
longuets. Elle estoit en toutes choses
honneste et grave, parlant peu à
peu et à propos; facile à escouter
toutes personnes, affable des plus
et faisant honneur à chascun, selon
sa qualité. Elle usoit d’une honneste
liberté de parler, sans rire, sans
se troubler, sans se mettre en cholère.
Elle estoit exempte de tout
fast, sans se déguiser le maintien,
sans user de délicatesse, et en toutes
ses actions monstrant une grande humilité.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>In presence of the numerous and
invariable testimonies of tradition,
not only the great antiquity, but also
the Druidic origin of the pilgrimage
of Notre Dame de Chartres appear
incontestable, and this belief is further
confirmed by many historical
documents, such as, for instance, the
letters-patent which in the year
1432 were granted at Loches to the
Chartrians by Charles VII., and
which contain the following declaration:</p>

<p>“L’Eglise de Chartres est la plus
ancienne de notre roïaume, fondée
par prophétie en l’honneur de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[838]</a></span>
glorieuse Vierge-Mère, avant l’incarnation
de Notre Seigneur Jhésus
Christ et en laquelle icelle glorieuse
Vierge fut adorée en son vivant.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Without allowing the same degree
of credence to the miracles which,
according to the archives of this
church, signalized the future power
of Mary in times anterior to the
Christian era, we will mention one
only of those among them which
appear to be worthy of belief. This
was represented in the rich mediæval
glass of the “Window of Miracles,”
destroyed at the Revolution,
where also could be read the name
of Geoffrey [Gaufridus].</p>

<p>This Geoffrey, in the time of the
Druids, was King of Montlhéry.
There were in those days kings in
profusion, and this one was vassal to
Priscus, King of Chartres. Geoffrey
had an only son, his chief joy, who
accidentally fell into the deep well of
the castle, and was taken out dead.
The king was distracted with grief,
but, having heard of sundry miracles
which had been wrought by the
Virgin of Chartres (to the amazement
of the Druids, who had known
nothing of the kind in their false religion),
he forthwith prayed to her
with many tears, entreating that she
would restore his son to life. Little
by little the youth began to breathe,
and soon was completely recovered.
The father, full of gratitude, went
with large offerings to the grotto to
return thanks for the life of his son.
Priscus showed himself no less devout.
He caused a statue to be
made after the pattern of the one at
Chartres, and placed it at Longpont,
where arose later a celebrated abbey,
and whither pilgrimages have ever
since continued to be made. Having
no child, he bequeathed all his rights
and possessions to the Virgin of
Chartres. Of these the Druids enjoyed
the benefit, and the French
chroniclers observe that the bishops
who have succeeded them are thus,
in fact, the temporal princes also of
the city, and that the Holy Virgin is
by legal right Lady of Chartres.</p>

<p>It is, however, on entirely different
and sufficient grounds for belief
that the facts must be placed which
relate to the arrival of the illustrious
saints, Savinian and Potentian, two
of those heroic missioners who were
called <i>bishops of the nations</i>, whom
Christian Rome, more eager to make
the conquest of the world than pagan
Rome had ever been, sent to
evangelize heathendom.</p>

<p>When these first preachers of
Christianity appeared among the
Carnutes, they found them subjugated,
indeed, by the Roman arms, but
exceptionally rebellious against all
endeavors that were used to induce
their adoption of the Roman gods;
still submissive to the Druids, whom
the conquerors persecuted as representing
the party of national resistance.</p>

<p>Potentian had associated with him
in his labors two faithful disciples, S.
Edoald and S. Altinus. Led by the
Spirit of God, and knowing the religious
belief of the Druids, he repaired
at once to the renowned grotto,
where he found them assembled, together
with a numerous concourse
of people; and, adapting to the occasion
the words of S. Paul at
Athens, he said to them: “This
Virgin whom you honor without
knowing I am come to make known
unto you”; and soon the darkness
giving place to light in minds that
were predisposed to receive it, a
large number of those present begged
forthwith for baptism. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[839]</a></span>
baptized in the water of the well, the
Druidic image received Christian
benediction, the altar was consecrated
to Mary, and the whole sanctuary
dedicated to the true God.</p>

<p>Mention is made of this ceremony
in the breviary of Chartres, on the
17th of October.</p>

<p>The new Christian community was
not destined to enjoy long peace.
Quirinus, the governor of the country
under the Emperor Claudius, in
obedience to an edict issued by the
latter against the Christians, entered
the grotto with a company of armed
soldiers when the faithful were there
assembled, and, seizing S. Potentian,
S. Edoald, and S. Altinus, reserved
them for more prolonged sufferings,
while he caused the rest of the worshippers
to be massacred on the
spot. Among these was found his
own daughter, since honored in the
church as S. Modesta. The bodies
of the martyrs were thrown into the
well of the grotto, which from that
time bore the name of <i>Le puits des
Saints Forts</i>.</p>

<p>The governor, being struck with
sudden death, was not permitted to
carry out his designs against S. Potentian
and his companions, who,
being set at liberty, proceeded to
Sens to continue their labors, leaving
S. Aventine at Chartres, of which city
he was the first bishop.</p>

<p>Setting aside the improbable legend
which relates that the people
of Chartres, upon learning that the
Blessed Virgin was still living, sent
an embassy to Ephesus to convey to
her their homage, and pray her to
receive the title of <i>Domina Carnoti</i>,
which, according to Guillaume le
Breton, she willingly accepted, we
hope in a future article to give the
eventful history of the erection of
the cathedral over the primitive
grotto, which in the XIth century
grew into the present vast and massive
crypt, perhaps the finest in the
world.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c839" id="c839">EARLY MARRIAGE.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> Dr. Johnson advocated the
early marriage of young men, he
spoke the morality of the Christian,
the wisdom of the philosopher, and
the knowledge of the man of the
world. He knew from his own experience,
and from the wild lives of
the men with whom he associated
during the first years of his London
life, that early marriage is the great
safeguard of youth, the preserver of
purity, and the sure promoter of
domestic happiness&mdash;“the only bliss
of paradise that has survived the
fall.”</p>

<p>Profoundly convinced of this, we
deliberately declare that early marriages
should be, as a general rule,
recommended and promoted by those
who have influence or authority over
young people. By early marriage,
we do not mean the marriage of boys
and girls, but of men and women.
Marriage is the only natural, proper,
and safe state for the majority of persons
living in the world. If one-third
of the angelic host&mdash;those bright and
pure spirits fresh from the divine
Hand&mdash;fell at the very first temptation,
how can man, prone as he is
to sin, hope to escape? If the saints
of old, who subjected their bodies to
the spirit by penances so terrible as
almost to realize Byron’s remark “of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[840]</a></span>
meriting heaven by making earth a
hell”&mdash;if these holy men found it so
difficult to resist the allurements of
the flesh, how can the pampered
and luxurious Christians of these
days, living in an atmosphere of
seduction, mingling in a gay and
wicked world, and thrown in constant
contact with men who break all the
Commandments with perfect indifference&mdash;how
can these Christians of
the latter days hope to avoid the
dangers that surround them if they
refuse to seek the safety that is
presented to them in marriage, unless
they make use of unusual means and
preventives which few are willing to
adopt.</p>

<p>Byron, who had tried all pleasures,
and gratified all his passions unto
satiety, declared that the “best state
for morals is marriage.” This was
the mature and deliberate opinion
of a man who had married most
wretchedly.</p>

<p>Shakespeare says, “A young man
married is a man that’s marr’d.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
But married, as he was, at the early
age of eighteen, to a woman eight
years his senior, he was a most glorious
contradiction of his own assertion.
So assured is his position as
the monarch of the world of literature,
that the most daring and ambitious
spirits have never presumed to
dispute his supremacy; much less
has there ever been found a man bold
enough to play the part of the Lucifer
of literature, and attempt to
deprive Shakespeare of his “pride
of place.” Surely, the fact of the
poor Stratford boy filling the world
with his name and fame after marrying
at eighteen, is an argument in
favor of early marriage.</p>

<p>“A young man married is <i>not</i> a
man that’s marr’d.” Had Byron
married his earliest and purest love,
Mary Chaworth, both the poet and
the world would have been the gainers.
We would then have had more
poems like the magnificent Fourth
Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>, and no
poem like the voluptuous <i>Don
Juan</i>. Domestic happiness, instead
of domestic misery, would have been
Byron’s earthly blessing; for the pure
affection of his noble though erring
heart would have been concentrated
upon one adored object. Moore’s
early marriage to his beautiful and
beloved Bessie did not “mar” his
brilliant career either in literature or
in society. Her love and sympathy
cheered him in his young and struggling
days, when&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">“All feverish and glowing,</p>
<p class="pp4">He rushed up the rugged way panting to fame.”</p>

<p class="pn1">When success crowned his efforts,
the praise and admiration of Bessie
were dearer to the young poet than
all the flattery lavished upon him
by the loveliest ladies of England;
and, when misfortune came which
drove away his summer friends, she
was ever by his side, brightening and
encouraging the desponding poet.</p>

<p>The wife of Disraeli was Disraeli’s
best and truest friend. Her influence
fired his latent ambition, and
brought into active use his finest talents.
Sustained by her, Disraeli
abandoned the idle and aimless life
of a London dandy, and became a
statesman and the leader of statesmen,
as Prime Minister of Great
Britain. His domestic life was most
happy. From the triumph of the
senate and the pageantry of the court,
he turned with unaffected delight to
his home-life and home-love. The
sweetest associations of his life all
clustered around that home, where
he always found the truest sympathy
and love. Fully realizing the blessing
of married life, he has written:
“Whatever be the lot of man, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[841]</a></span>
inferior, however oppressed, if
he only love and be loved, he must
strike a balance in favor of existence;
for love can illumine the dark roof
of poverty, and lighten the fetter of
the slave.”</p>

<p>These few examples, which may
be multiplied indefinitely, are given
to show that, so far as fame is concerned,
“a young man married is
<i>not</i> a man that’s marr’d.”</p>

<p>Now, to another and more practical
view of the matter. How many
young men give as a reason for not
marrying that they can’t afford it&mdash;that
marriage is a luxury only for
the rich? We know that the sordid
forms of fashionable society have
encircled this heavenly rose called
love with so many thorns that the
opulent alone can gather it with
safety. We also know that, in the
gay world, as Lady Modish observes
in the <i>Careless Husband</i>, “sincerity
in love is as much out of fashion as
sweet snuff&mdash;nobody takes it now.”
But what man of sense, what man
who longs for love and a home,
would think of marrying a woman of
fashion whose mornings are passed
in bed over a sensational novel,
whose afternoons are spent on the
street, and whose evenings are
danced away in the ball-room?</p>

<p>It is a great and deplorable mistake
to suppose that only the rich can
afford to marry. Dining with Chief-Justice
Chase in Washington, some
one mentioned that Mr.&mdash;&mdash; had of
late grown cynical and censorious,
because he was engaged and could
not afford to marry. Well do we
remember the remark of the Chief-Justice,
that “any young man who
can support himself can support a
wife&mdash;that is, if he is wise enough to
select the right sort of person.” Mr.
Chase spoke from his own personal
experience; for he had married when
he was young, poor, and unknown,
and his success began with his marriage.
Take any young man of
average intelligence and industry&mdash;a
lawyer, clerk, or journalist&mdash;he
makes enough to live comfortably and
to save, but he is not willing to follow
Mr. Micawber’s philosophy of
happiness: “Income, £100 a year;
expenses, £99 19<i>s.</i>&mdash;happiness. Income,
£100 a year; expenses, £100
1<i>s.</i>&mdash;misery.” Which, in plain English,
means&mdash;make more than you
spend, and you will be happy; spend
more than you make, and you will
be miserable.</p>

<p>Our young lawyer, clerk, or journalist
is not satisfied to live comfortably:
he must live luxuriously. He
must smoke the best cigars, drink
the choicest wines, wear the most
fashionable clothes; he must belong
to a club, play billiards, go to
the opera; he must drive to the
park, when he can ride in the city
cars; he must spend his summer
holiday at Saratoga or Long Branch&mdash;in
short, he must live as extravagantly
as the idle sons of rich men
with whom he associates. To do
this, he must necessarily live beyond
his means.</p>

<p>These are the young men who say
they <i>cannot afford to marry</i>. They
<i>can</i> afford to marry if they will give
up expenses which are always useless
and often dangerous. Addison
says with admirable truth: “All
men are not equally qualified for
getting money, but it is in the power
of every one alike to practise the
virtue of thrift; and I believe there
are few persons who, if they please
to reflect on their own past lives,
will not find that, had they saved all
those little sums which they have
spent unnecessarily, they might at
present have been masters of a competent
fortune.” Certainly, if young
men will practise the habit of saving
“those little sums” which are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[842]</a></span>
often “unnecessarily spent,” they will
no longer have to complain that
they cannot afford to marry.</p>

<p>The laws of Sparta required a
man to marry when he became of
age; if he did not, he was liable to
prosecution. The salutary effect of
this was seen in the superior morality
of the Spartans over the other people
of Greece. The morality of the
people of Ireland is one of the
brightest gems in the crown of the
“loved Island of Sorrow”; the practice
of early marriage among the
Irish contributes, in a great measure,
to this angelic virtue of chastity.
The pernicious practice of marrying
late in life, which prevails generally
among Frenchmen, is one of the
chief causes of the licentiousness of
that gay and gallant nation. Unfortunately,
a tendency towards late
marriage has been gradually growing
among the American people, especially
in our large cities. This is
one of the most dangerous and disheartening
signs of the times. It
arises from the love of luxury and
display which has overspread the
land and destroyed that republican
simplicity of life and manners which
was once the glory and strength of
this nation.</p>

<p>Fathers are unwilling that their
daughters should marry young men
who are not rich, forgetting that they
themselves were poor when they
married, and that their wealth has
been amassed by long years of constant
toil. Such fathers should remember
the answer of Themistocles,
when asked whether he would choose
to marry his daughter to a poor man
of merit, or to a worthless man of an
estate: “I would prefer a man without
an estate to an estate without
a man.” Daughters are unwilling
to abandon a life of idleness and
luxury in their father’s house to
share the fortunes of young men
who, though poor in person, are rich
in worth, and have that within them
which will command success. Such
daughters should remember that a
young lady once refused to marry a
young man on account of his poverty,
whose death was mourned by
two continents&mdash;the noble philanthropist,
George Peabody. When
the late Emperor of France was
living in poverty in London, he fell
in love with a lady of rank and
beauty, and solicited her hand. The
lady, who regarded him as a mere
political dreamer, rejected his suit,
when he uttered this prophetic remark:
“Madame, you have refused a
crown.” Few young ladies have an
opportunity of “refusing a crown,”
but, in refusing young men of talent,
industry, and virtue, on account of
their present poverty, to accept
worthless young men of fortune,
they frequently refuse a life of domestic
peace and happiness for one
of splendid misery.</p>

<p>The ancient philosophers very
wisely defined marriage to be a
remedy provided by Providence for
the safety and preservation of youth.
We all require sympathy and love,
and where can there be sympathy so
perfect and love so enchanting as
that which a true wife feels for her
husband? Chateaubriand, in his
magnificent work, <i>The Genius of
Christianity</i>, gives us a sweet and
affecting description of the Christian
husband and wife: “The wife of a
Christian is not a mere mortal: she
is an extraordinary, a mysterious,
an angelic being; she is flesh of her
husband’s flesh, and bone of his
bone. By his union with her, he
only takes back a portion of his substance.
His soul as well as his body
is imperfect without his wife. He
possesses strength; she has beauty.
He encounters afflictions, and the
partner of his life is there to soothe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[843]</a></span>
him. Without woman, he would be
rude, unpolished, solitary. Woman
suspends around him the flowers of
life, like those honeysuckles of the
forest which adorn the trunk of the
oak with their perfumed garlands.”</p>

<p>Well might the great poet of domestic
bliss exclaim of marriage:</p>

<p class="ppn6q p1">“Such a sacred and homefelt delight,<br />
Such sober certainty of waking bliss,<br />
I never heard till now.”</p>

<p class="p1">All readers will recall the exquisite
description of the married life of
Albert and Alexandrina in <i>A Sister’s
Story</i>; their charming home at Castellamare,
on the Bay of Naples; the
soft air and brilliant skies of Italy;
excursions among the lovely islands
of the bay; pious pilgrimages to
holy shrines; their summer trip to
the East; their winter in Venice,
followed by the declining health of
Albert; their return to France; and
the saintly death of Albert at the
early age of twenty-four.</p>

<p>Our American Catholic youth
owe a duty to their church and
their country which they neglect
with criminal indifference. What
become of the many young men of
brilliant promise who each year
leave our Catholic colleges laden
with honors? Why are their voices
never heard after commencement
day? Why is their graduation thesis
their last literary composition? It
is because the seed of learning planted
in their minds at college, like the
seed of the husbandman in the Gospel
which fell among thorns, is
choked with the riches and pleasures
of life, and yields no fruit.</p>

<p>No better example can be offered
for the imitation of American Catholic
young men than that of Montalembert,
the great orator of France.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
Even in his schoolboy days, his aim
was high and beautiful: he scorned
all folly and idleness. When he
was only seventeen, he solemnly selected
as his motto through life,
“God and Liberty,” to which he
remained faithful until death. A
young man of brilliant intellect, vivid
imagination, and noble ambition, he
determined to play a man’s part in
the world, and earnestly longed for
the time to commence his glorious
work. He wasted not the golden
days of youth amid the gay frivolities
of fashionable amusement, for
he vehemently denied that youth
was the time which should be devoted
to the pleasures of society. He
contended that youth should be given
up with ardor to study or to preparation
for a profession. “Ah!”
he exclaims, “when one has paid
one’s tribute to one’s country; when
it is possible to appear in society
crowned with the laurels of debate,
or of the battle-field, or at least of
universal wisdom; when one is sure
of commanding respect and admiration
everywhere&mdash;then it is the time
to like society, and enter it with satisfaction.
I can imagine Pitt or
Fox coming out of the House of
Commons, where they had struck
their adversaries dumb by their
eloquence, and enjoying a dinner
party.”</p>

<p>This admirable advice from one
who so worthily won his way in the
world and in society should be carefully
considered by the youth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[844]</a></span>
America, who too frequently rush
into society half educated, and wholly
unfit for the duties and responsibilities
of the world. An early marriage
is the best beginning for those
not called to the ecclesiastical or religious
state. It gives at once an
object and an aim to life. It fixes
the heart, and keeps it warm and
bright, preventing it from running to
waste. It is a holy state, established
by God as the ordinary means for
the happiness and salvation of the
greatest number of the faithful. As
a rule, it is the safest state for persons
living an ordinary life, and for
many it is the only one which is safe.
As there is no rule, however, without
exceptions, we do not intend to deny
that there are many exceptions to
this rule. Numbers of persons, especially
among the devout female sex,
are called to a single life in the
world either by inclination or necessity,
and are both better and more
happy in that state than they would
be in any other. The reasons which
we have presented in favor of marriage
and of early marriage apply,
therefore, only generally and not universally
to persons in all the ranks
and conditions of society, and have
their more especial force in relation
to those who live in what is called
“the world,” but most especially in
reference to young men.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c844" id="c844">SCHOLARS <i>EN DÉSHABILLÉ</i>.</a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Scholars</span> before the world and
scholars at home are often the greatest
contrast to themselves. Daily
life is, after all, so levelling that it
makes a <i>tabula rasa</i> of crowned
heads and peasants, of sages and
fools, of good men and bad. There
is no visible <i>nimbus</i> round the head
of the man who towers above his
fellows, as there is round the summit
of the mountain that pierces the
clouds. Without the conventional
distinctions of costumes, attendance,
or display, there is no means of telling
the man of giant intellect from
the man of common attainments.
Not that some men lack that physical
superiority which at once causes
a stranger to turn eagerly round and
ask, “Who is that?” but this mark
so often accompanies other men
whose interior life does not justify its
presence, or whose career has been a
mistake and a failure, that it is practically
valueless. The outward sign
or “ticket” requisite to denote a
man of acknowledged station is
therefore as necessary in this blind
world as it is humiliating to the
world’s sense of discernment. Take
an imaginary procession of magnates,
financial, political, artistic, royal, or
noble, dress them in plain citizen’s
garb, and then send in a child to
pick out the prizes among them, to
distinguish the bishop from the chancellor,
the diplomatist from the banker,
the king from the scholar.
Guided by purely natural instinct
(not unlike that which presided at
the election of barbarian chieftains
in the Vth century), the child will
call the tallest, strongest, manliest
personage the king, and will choose
the most venerable, gentle, and serious
as the bishop. Ten to one it
will have taken a soldier for king,
and an artist for bishop; and so on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[845]</a></span>
<i>ad infinitum</i>. Now place those great
people in suitable coaches, dress
them in appropriate robes, put on
them the crowns, coronets, crosses,
and insignia of their order, and the
veriest baby will recognize by the
conventional instinct of civilization
the rank and importance of each;
only it will then be seen that the
king is that quiet man of banker-like
aspect, the bishop yonder retiring
individual with a bald head, the
financier that dandy with the unobtrusive
gold ring and faultless yet
severe costume, the ambassador that
commonplace-looking person hidden
under stars and ribbons. Change
the slide once more, set all these
good people down at their respective
homes, and look through the
magic-lantern again. What do we
see? A dining-room, a table set
with more or less perfection of appointments,
a few noiseless servants
and romping children, a homely, middle-aged
matron, serene and placid,
perhaps looking over an account-book
or hemming pocket-handkerchiefs.
The bishop’s household alone
will wear a distinctive mark, but,
compared with other ecclesiastical
abodes, will keep its master’s secrets
as well as any secular one. God
alone knows where to point to a
saint or a genius among these ordinary
surroundings, and the objects
of his discernment would often surprise
any human observer who should
be admitted to share his knowledge.</p>

<p>The craving which men have to
know the details of the private life
of any one distinguished from the
commonalty by talent or position is
an inexplicable phenomenon, and
one that to the end will defy our
solution and persist in remaining in
force long after we have decided
that it has no business to exist. Is
it that we are envious of everything
above us, and wish to dim its glory
by putting it to the same test as our
own dull being? Is it through a
morbid desire to analyze that which,
against our will, enchants us, in order
that, having done so, and reduced
it to various elements which separately
are powerless to charm, we
may depreciate the whole? Or is it
through that loftier feeling that urges
us to ally ourselves by sympathy
with all that is noble and exalted
in human nature? Do we long to
claim at least a fellowship with intellect
through the sacred instincts
which intellect and mediocrity share
alike? It is unfortunately as often
through the baser as through the
nobler feeling; and yet, when we
have sifted the tendency to its simplest
elements, we cannot say that
we have personally rid ourselves of
the foible or learned the lesson of
lofty incuriousness which by implication
we have taught.</p>

<p>The daily life and privations, the
struggles and successes, the domestic
joys, sorrows, and losses of great
men have a deeper meaning than
shows on the surface; for not only
have they influenced the works or
writings through which these men
have become known to us, but they
show how independent of outward
circumstances is their greatness. In
this sense, they present encouragement
to many in whom the same
qualities are latent, but who from
faintheartedness might otherwise
have neglected their gifts and wasted
their powers. They teach yet
another lesson; for in them we see
what compensations the mind gives
in the midst of even sordid trials,
and how the higher a man’s intellectual
training is, so much the stronger
is his moral endurance. But draw
what moral we will from them, the
interest in them remains and will
remain to the end of time. Trivial
as they are, too, they somehow fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[846]</a></span>
the personality of a man of genius
better in the mind of posterity than
his greatest virtues or doughtiest
deeds; as, for instance, King Alfred is
better remembered as the disguised
soldier burning the cakes of his
peasant-hostess than as the wise lawgiver
and heroic chieftain of the
Saxons. Prince Charlie’s romantic
escapes have endeared him to the
Scottish heart and made him the
centre of the later traditions of a
romantic people, while no such halo
gathers round the person of the
First or Second Charles of England,
even though the “Martyr-King” has
won by his tragical death a separate
niche in the Valhalla of history.</p>

<p>In all ages and all climes, learning
and wealth have seldom gone
together. Anecdotes of scholars
whose daily wants were in sad contrast
with their aspirations abound
in the records of all centres of learning.
Dr. Newman, in his lectures
on universities, has given us many
touching as well as ludicrous examples
of this truth. Among the disciples
of Pythagoras, if we recollect
accurately, was one Cleanthes, a
professional boxer from Corinth,
who, smitten with a love of wisdom,
came to Athens to become a philosopher.
As he had not even the
trifling daily sum required by the
professor of learning, he spent half
of each day in earning it by <i>carrying
water</i> and doing such like services
to the citizens, while the remaining
hours he passed at the academy.
One day, the wind blew his upper
garment open, and his luckier companions
most “unphilosophically”
jeered him when they saw that his
outer covering was all that he had.
He afterwards rose to great proficiency,
and taught a school of his
own&mdash;never, however, discarding his
simple ways. The well-known story
of the three students who had but
one cloak between them and wore it
each in his turn in the lecture-hall
while the others stayed in bed, is
told of Athenians as well as Saxons,
Irish, or Italians in the universities
of the middle ages. Bp. Vaughan’s
<i>Life of S. Thomas</i> abounds with
such anecdotes of impecunious and
enthusiastic scholars. S. Thomas
himself, it is related, wrote his <i>Summa</i>
(not the great work, but a previous
and less comprehensive book)
on such stray pieces of parchment,
old letters, torn covers, etc., as he
could pick up or beg from his fellow-students.
S. Richard of Canterbury,
when teaching in his chair
at Oxford, was so careless of his
<i>honorarium</i> that he generally left it
on the window-sill, unless he had
need of it to relieve some poor person.
The same saint in his youth
was sometimes so frozen to the bone
that he could not continue his studies
and was fain to run round the
court of the school for half an hour
every night to restore circulation before
he went to bed. The Oxford
students suffered hunger as well as
cold in the service of philosophy,
for they often had no other resource
than to beg the broken victuals from
the tables of the tradesmen, and
one of them avers in a private letter
that, on a great holiday, he and his
friends made merry over an unusual
feast&mdash;“a penny piece of beef between
four.”</p>

<p>In Paris, the case was the same.
The lay students suffered most, for
each of the great religious orders
had its own representative house,
and the young religious lived in
community. Among the seculars it
was different; they were quartered
on the citizens, and, when they were
honest as well as industrious, led a
terribly hard life. They lodged in
garrets, and lay on straw; their landlords
extorted from them exorbitant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[847]</a></span>
rents for their share of the filthy
tenement, and they often had to depend
on charity for their food. Ingenious
as poverty always is, it suggested
remedies to these harassed
votaries of learning, even as it has in
all succeeding ages. The poorer
students took to copying books and
selling them at starvation prices,
working for others when they could
find patrons, for themselves when
they were forced to do so. Thus
originated bookstalls and private
shops for the sale of books, parchment,
wax, and ink. In the dark
days of winter, the want of light was
severely felt by those who were too
poor to buy oil, and pale, shivering
forms might be seen huddled in
doorways, grouped on corners, or
gathered round a street-shrine, anywhere,
in fact, where a lamp could
be found, all intent on their notes of
yesterday’s lecture, or busily examining
the subject of to-morrow’s lesson.
Beside them was ever the
other world of students&mdash;the gay,
rich, and careless: those who spent
in one night’s revel what would have
bought parchment and oil for six
months for the thrifty, hard-working
copyist of MSS. But what martyrdoms
were undergone for knowledge’s
sake in those days of earnest
search after science no man can tell.
Knowing less of the details of mediæval
life than we do of the daily
needs of later generations, we can
perhaps hardly appreciate the degree
of privation endured by these
sturdy knowledge-seekers.</p>

<p>Turning to the chivalrous land of
Germany, we find, in the same
century as that of S. Thomas and
the students of Paris University, the
school of poor minstrels, the famous
Minnesingers. Kroeger, in his work
on them and their novel art, says:
“These singers led a life most strange
and romantic. At a time when
cities had as yet barely come into
existence in Germany, and the castles
of the lords were the chief gathering-places
of the vast floating
population of the Crusading times,
these Minnesingers, with <i>little or nothing</i>
besides their sword, fiddle, or
harp and some bit of love-ribbon
or the like from their sweetheart,
wandered from village to village,
and castle to castle, everywhere
welcomed with gladness, and receiving
their expected remuneration
with the proud unconcern of strolling
vagabonds.... For these
singing knights felt no more delicacy
in chronicling the good things they
received from their patrons than in
immortalizing the meanness of those
who let them depart without <i>gifts of
clothing, food, and money</i>....
The young knight was by custom
compelled to saunter forth into the
world, and generally by poverty to
keep on sauntering in this fashion
all his lifetime. Then he perfected
himself in the art of composing
songs and playing some stringed
instrument, which became both a
source of infinite enjoyment and an
unfailing source of revenue if the
knight was poor. With his art, he
paid his boarding-bills; his art furnished
him with clothes, horses, and
equipments. More than all, his art
won him the love of his lady.”</p>

<p>Walther von der Vogelweide&mdash;“bird’s
pasture or meadow”&mdash;was
one of the foremost of these wandering
troubadours, and, as he himself
tells us, was very poor. He went
to Austria to better his fortunes by
the knightly art alone fit for one of
gentle birth, and among his patrons
found one, the Duke of Kärnten,
whose meanness has come down to
posterity, through the then obscure
minstrel’s verse, in having “withheld
a promised suit of new clothes”
from the poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">[848]</a></span></p>

<p>Walther’s best luck seems to have
been his appointment as tutor to the
son of the Emperor Frederic II.
This led to his being given a small
estate with fixed income; but he had
struggled long enough in gay though
hopeless poverty before fortune singled
him out for her favors. As
usual, his mind was far beyond the
standard of his circumstances; a
thinker, philosopher, observer of human
nature, an active member of
the state when he participated in
political duties, a conscientious patriot
and a true Catholic. In politics
he never refused to recognize whatever
merits the opposite party held,
nor to denounce any injustice on the
part of his own; in religion, he was
always alive to the abuses of the time,
despite his devout faith and earnest
worship. Kroeger says of him that,
though but “little tainted by the
prejudices of nationality, he is, in his
thorough earnestness and rare purity
of spirit, even more truly a representative
German than either Goethe
or Schiller.” Of later authors, poets,
artists, there are ampler memoirs
left to teach us the inner and darker
life of the spirit we know in this
bright public envelope. The Greeks,
who held that all free-born men,
Hellenes by descent, had a right to
become learned and elegant scholars,
and who upon this theory based
their practice of having slaves to do
that work which did not comport
with the calm attitude of mind necessary
to philosophical study, made use
of very cogent arguments, humanly
speaking. It remained for Christianity
to do something more sublime yet
than to devote an entire class of men to
lofty aims and studies; it was reserved
for Christ’s law to change even menial
pursuits and vulgar necessities into employments
fit for the highest intellect.
The soul’s sanctification became a
loftier aim than the cultivation of the
mind alone, and every office, however
lowly, was made capable of
ministering to this new aim. Thus
was the stigma which the pagan
world had set upon poverty and dependence
removed, but the fact of
poverty was to remain for ever. Just
as by his death our Lord had taken
away, not the fact of death, but “its
sting, its victory,” and its ignominy,
so by his life he took all bitterness
from that inevitable condition of the
majority of mankind&mdash;physical need
and suffering.</p>

<p>How far this century, and indeed
the spirit of the world in all centuries,
has succeeded in counteracting
this beneficent change, and in fastening
again upon poverty the disgrace
entailed, on it by the pagan system,
each one can judge for himself.
Nay, many have a personal standard
by which they can judge of it. One
cannot read the life of any person of
merit in any branch of learning without
this pathetic element constantly
cropping out. Here we have Kepler,
the astronomer, struggling with
constant anxieties, telling fortunes
for a livelihood, and saying that astrology,
as the daughter of astronomy,
ought to keep her mother. “I
supplicate you,” he writes to a friend
of his, “if there is a situation vacant
at Tübingen, do what you can to obtain
it for me, and let me know the
prices of bread and wine, and other
necessaries of life; for my wife is not
accustomed to live on beans.” He
had to accept all sorts of jobs; he
made almanacs, and served any one
who would pay him. The gentle,
melancholy Schiller wasted by necessity
much of his time in literary
hack-work at a period when the pay
of authors was so miserable that they
could hardly exist by the pen: he
translated French books at “a shilling
a page.” Even Goethe, whose fortune
was quite independent, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[849]</a></span>
not add to his income by his talent;
and when Merck, the publisher, offered
three pounds sterling for a
drama of his, the old poet might
well ask: “If Europe praised me,
what has Europe done for me?
Nothing. Even my works have
been an expense to me.”</p>

<p>Perhaps no life has ever been so
continual a struggle as that of Oliver
Goldsmith. From his very childhood
he was used to starvation; for
family difficulties caused him to go
to Dublin University, not as a pensioner
(as he had hoped), but as a
sizar. He had to sweep the courts,
wait at table, and perform other menial
tasks of the same sort. It was a
bitter price to pay for learning, but
his after-life was no sweeter in its
manifold experiences. Before he
left college, his father died, and he
was thrown on his own resources,
when he often had to pawn his
books, and at last took to writing
street-ballads, which he disposed of
at five shillings per copy. Twice
the shiftless scholar tried to make
his way to America, and failed; his
pretensions to Anglican orders were
crushed by his failure to pass his
examination, and his venture as a
tutor was equally unsuccessful. His
good genius, his uncle, Mr. Contarine,
sent him to Edinburgh to become
a physician, and this was the
last of the regular professions which
he tried. We find him wandering
through Flanders, singing and playing
his flute at the houses of the
peasantry, in order to obtain a supper
and a night’s lodging; then attending
chemical lectures at the Universities
of Leyden and Louvain;
taking part in the open discussions on
philosophical subjects held on certain
days in the convents and colleges of
Italy, and returning to England without
a farthing in his pocket; then
taking a fortnight to reach London
from Dover, begging, performing, or
playing on the road. He went
among the London apothecaries,
“and asked them to let him spread
plasters for them, pound in their
mortars, or run with their medicines.”
It was through a poor journeyman
printer, a patient of his, that he first
gained the notice of a great publisher;
but his troubles were only
increased by his literary ventures.
Now he is in a garret, with the milk-woman
knocking at the door, pressing
him for a trifling milk-score,
which he is too poor to pay; now he
repeatedly loses the chance of good
situations, because he has not a decent
suit of clothes to his back.
Once a publisher provided him with
clothes, in advance, for four reviews
for his magazine; but before Goldsmith
has finished his work, his landlord
is dragged away by bailiffs to
pass his Christmas in prison for debt.
The impulsive author has no money,
but immediately runs and pawns his
clothes, liberating his miserable host,
and rejoicing the poor family. Left
starving himself, he gets a trifling
loan from a friend on the four books
to be reviewed, when the publisher
makes a sudden and peremptory demand
for the clothes and books, or
payment for the same. Goldsmith
begs him, as a favor, “for fear of
worse happening to him,” to put him
in gaol. The pay he received for
his ceaseless work was ridiculously
slender; for his <i>Plutarch’s Lives</i> he
got eight pounds a volume. The
novel which has immortalized his
name, the <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>, was
sold for sixty pounds, and in the
most unceremonious fashion possible.
Johnson, the author’s fast friend,
gives the story of the transaction
thus: “I received one morning a
message from poor Goldsmith that
he was in great distress, and, as it
was not in his power to come to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[850]</a></span>
begging that I would come to him
as soon as possible. I sent him a
guinea, and promised to come to him
directly. I accordingly went as
soon as I was dressed, and found
that his landlady had arrested him
for his rent, at which he was in a
violent passion.... I desired
he would be calm; ... he then
told me that he had a novel ready
for the press, which he produced to
me. I looked into it, and saw its
merits, told the landlady I should
soon return, and, having gone to a
bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds.
I brought Goldsmith the money, and
he discharged his rent.” The famous
novel, so hastily disposed of to
stave off actual starvation and imprisonment,
was thought so little of
by its new owner that it was eighteen
months before he published it.
Although his fame grew with years,
Goldsmith remained in distress; for
he never could keep what he earned.
Indiscriminate generosity, often
lavished on unworthy companions,
swallowed up his growing but always
transitory income; and the week after
a gorgeous supper or a tailor’s
bill of extravagant items duly receipted,
we yet find him writing a
short English grammar for <i>five
pounds</i>, and, later on, borrowing <i>one
pound</i> from his publisher.</p>

<p>The young poet Chatterton, impulsive,
gifted, and unfortunate, the contemporary
and friend of Goldsmith,
was another victim to the fickleness
of the muse. Starving and desperate,
he at last committed suicide in
a miserable London garret, in a dirty
street leading out of Holborn, a
neighborhood not much more desirable
than Baxter Street, New York.
There was no one to claim his body,
and it was finally taken to the “bonehouse”
of St. Andrew’s, and buried
in the pauper burial-ground in Shoe
Lane.</p>

<p>In thriving America, the El Dorado
of the untaught European imagination,
the scholar is hardly destined
to a happier lot than in the old
realms where intellect is supposed
to have a traditionary value. Of
Nathaniel Hawthorne we have various
records of want and manful
struggle. Always brave under adverse
circumstances, this is how he
words his own misfortunes in 1820,
when, still a boy, he already edited
a small and obscure periodical called
the <i>Spectator</i>. Among the obituary
notices one day, the following was
conspicuous: “We are sorry to be
under the necessity of informing our
readers that no death of any importance
has taken place, except that of
the publisher of this paper, who died
of starvation, owing to the slenderness
of his patronage.” In 1839,
he had been so lucky, in a worldly
sense, as to have secured the post of
head-collector of the port of Salem,
Mass.; and, in this uncongenial yet
lucrative situation, he felt beyond the
reach of necessity. He curiously laments
his ludicrous dilemma, and
comments on his name, “Nathaniel
Hawthorne,” which he had fondly
hoped from his childhood to have
sent forth to the world on the title-page
of some important work, now
taking wing for the remotest ends
of the earth, scrawled in red chalk
on the covers of packing-cases, tea-chests,
and cotton-bales. Political
changes twice ousted him from his
position, and the second ejection was
definitive&mdash;a starting-point in his life.
He went home one evening, and announced
his dispossession to his wife.
There were no provisions in the
house, save a barrel of flour and some
insignificant adjuncts. The family
had hardly any money in hand, but
no one complained. Hawthorne told
his wife he was going to write in
earnest, and they must trust to Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[851]</a></span>
in the meanwhile. Partly by
economy of the most rigid kind,
partly by the helping hand of friendly
neighbors, the Hawthornes managed
to keep the “wolf from the
door” till the novel was completed.
The evening it was finished, the author,
feverish, excited, and emaciated,
closeted himself with his wife,
and read her the MS. She listened
intently, the interest becoming painful,
her breath came and went, her
color faded gradually, and, at the
climax of the wonderful story, fell at
his feet almost in convulsions, exclaiming,
“For God’s sake, do not
read further; I cannot bear it.”
Next morning, he sent the novel to a
friend of his, a sound judge and unsparing
critic in the literary world.
The friend <i>raced</i> through the MS., enthralled
by its powerful word-imagery,
and came himself with his answer.
Meeting the author’s little boy, Julian,
in the garden in front of the
house, he caught him up in his arms,
exclaiming: “Child! child! do you
know what a father you have?” and
rushed into the house, fairly storming
the newly revealed genius with congratulations.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Thus was the <i>Scarlet
Letter</i> produced and Hawthorne’s
name made. After that, his success
was rapid, and literature proved a
sufficient support for her gifted votary.</p>

<p>Another American genius was less
fortunate. In Baltimore, a periodical
entitled the <i>Saturday Visitor</i> offered
a prize for the best poem and story
(the amount we cannot precisely recollect).
When the candidates’ MSS.
were examined, one of them proved
to be a collection of clever poems
and a story written almost in “copper-plate”
hand. The editors looked
no further, but said, in joke,
“Let us give the prize to the first
of geniuses who has written legibly.”
The name of the young author was
Edgar Allan Poe.</p>

<p>“He came just as he was,” says
his biographer, “the prize-money not
having yet been sent him, with a
seedy coat buttoned up to conceal
the total absence of linen, but with
shoes whose gaping crevices could
not be made to hide the absence of
socks.” Mr. Kennedy (the editor)
took him to the tailor, and fitted him
out as comfortably and completely
as possible, after which he was installed
as an inmate of his house,
and for a little time employed on the
staff of the <i>Saturday Visitor</i>. This
was in 1833. The vicissitudes of
fortune were perpetual, though to his
terrible propensity to intemperance
much of his constant distress was
due. A gentleman despite the squalor
of his appearance, a genius despite
his uncontrolled vices, he was
one of the most unfortunate of men.
A few years later, he writes to a friend:
“Can you not send me five dollars?
I am sick, and Virginia (his wife) is
almost gone.” In 1839, his prospects
were for the moment not so hopeless,
and one who often visited him testified
to his home in Philadelphia,
“though slightly and cheaply furnished,”
being yet “so tasteful and
refined, so fitly disposed, that it seemed
altogether suitable for a man of
genius.” Again, his biographer
speaks of him as “always in pecuniary
difficulties, and his sick wife frequently
in want of the merest necessities
of life.” For his poem “The
Raven,” first published in the <i>Whig
Review</i>, and since become the pedestal
of his worldwide fame, he received
the sum of <i>ten dollars</i>; and in 1848,
while writing for the <i>Southern Literary
Messenger</i>, he was content to work
for two dollars a page. And yet, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[852]</a></span>
far as fame was concerned, Poe’s
name and talent were known beyond
the seas, admired by two continents;
and when, upon entering an office in
New York, he would mention who
he was, men turned round to stare
at the gifted poet who, all starving
as he was, was already enrolled
among the great men of America.</p>

<p>The philosopher, Jean Jacques
Rousseau, had equal occasion to put
his philosophy to the same universal
test of patience. Finding a mercantile
clerkship ill-adapted to his poetic
and vagrant humor, he left Geneva
and went to Lausanne, where he tried
music as a profession. His experiences
were curious. He tried to
teach music, but, as he says himself,
“The scholars <i>did not crowd</i>, and
two or three German boys, luckily as
stupid as I was ignorant of my business,
were my only pupils. Under
my tuition they did not become great
<i>croquenotes</i>. One day, I was sent
for to a house to teach a little ‘serpent
of a girl,’ to whom it gave infinite
pleasure to show me a quantity
of music I did not know, and then
to play one piece for me, ‘just to show
the master how it should go.’ I
knew absolutely so little of reading
that I could not follow a note of my
own composition in such a manner
as to be able to regulate its execution.”
It may be supposed the poor
man did not thrive on these means
of livelihood; his fare was meagre
enough, and he paid only thirty
francs a month for his board and
lodging in the little inn where he
made his home. For his dinner, he
had but one dish of soup, with something
a little more substantial for his
supper at night. Notwithstanding
his desire for independence and
freedom from the personal thraldom
(<i>assujettissement</i>) of a fixed and sedentary
occupation, he found out that
“one must live.” So he took to
copying music at a small remuneration,
and so fond did he become of
his self-chosen trade (for with him it
was not art) that in later life, when in
comfortable circumstances, he took
to it again. But his musical mania
went yet further. He composed an
operetta entitled <i>Le Devin du Village</i>&mdash;“The
Village Astrologer, or Fortune-teller”&mdash;and
had it executed at
Lausanne. He says of its first performance
“that it was such a <i>charivari</i>
as could not be surpassed; that
every one shut their ears and opened
wide their eyes; that it was a witch’s
sabbath, a devilish hubbub, insupportable
and monstrous.” The
tide turned one day, and the same
play was performed in the court
theatre at Versailles, the family and
courtiers of Louis XVI. calling the
music dream-like, divine, entrancing!
This sounds like an anticipation of
the diversity of opinion now observable
concerning Wagner and Liszt.</p>

<p>Real artists, like Mozart, were
hardly more fortunate in their domain
of legitimate art than was Rousseau
in his queer attempts at music.
Although his name was known, his
music extolled to the skies, and his
person retained as a priceless court
treasure at Vienna, Wolfgang Mozart
hardly made a competency by his
unrivalled and acknowledged genius.
His early death was mainly the result
of continual anxiety on the score
of personal necessities. When the
mysterious stranger came and gave
the order for the requiem, Mozart
was already ill, worn, and exhausted.
The stranger’s opportune gift, or
fragment in advance, came too late,
though it was sorely needed at the
time; and, before the order was completed,
the great musician was on his
death-bed, his wife Constance by his
side, his friends rehearsing the finished
part of the requiem at the foot of
his bed, while his haggard features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">[853]</a></span>
were lit up to the last by the feverish
enthusiasm so soon to be quenched
in death.</p>

<p>It would seem as though the
greater the genius, the greater the
destitution. Hardly one has escaped
the furnace of poverty. Curran,
the great Irish lawyer and orator, was
stranded early in life, without friends,
connections, or fortune, conscious of
talent above the crowd that elbowed
him, and sensitive to a painful degree.
He himself thus tells the story of the
first fee of any consequence which he
received in his profession: “I then
lived upon Hog Hill, Dublin; my
wife and children were the chief
furniture of my apartments; as to my
rent, it stood much the same chance
of its liquidation with the national
debt. Mrs. Curran, however, was a
barrister’s lady, and what was wanting
in wealth she was well determined
should be supplied by dignity.
The landlady, on the other hand, had
no idea of any other gradation except
that of pounds, shillings, and pence.
I walked out one morning, in order
to avoid the perpetual altercations on
this subject, with my mind, you may
imagine, in no very enviable temperament.
I fell into gloom, to which
from my infancy I had been occasionally
subject. I had a family,
for whom I had no dinner, and a
landlady, for whom I had no rent. I
had gone abroad in despondence; I
returned home almost in desperation.
When I opened the door of my
study the first object that presented
itself was an immense folio of a brief,
twenty golden guineas wrapped up
beside it, and the name of <i>old Bob
Lyons</i> marked on the back of it. I
paid my landlady, bought a good
dinner, gave Bob Lyons a share of
it, and that dinner was the date of
my prosperity!”</p>

<p>One of the most Christian and
sympathetic authors of France (in a
department in which it must be confessed
she does not excel&mdash;poetry),
Alphonse de Lamartine, was both in
his youth and in his old age the
victim of poverty. Though in his
childhood his poverty was not absolutely
sordid, like that of many a
scholar as talented and even as well
born, still it was such that his mother
had to exercise the strictest economy
on her small property, to help
her peasant-servants in many a lowly
household task, and was in such straits
that the failure or success of her slender
vintage was to her the chief event
of the year. A noble woman, a Christian
Cornelia, she knew how to turn
these troubles into lessons for her son;
and a more genial, lovable “great
man” than Lamartine has seldom
claimed our homage, notwithstanding
the foibles which necessarily qualify
our admiration. Political and diplomatic
success gave him far different
prospects in middle life. His poems
were the first heralds, the joy-bells,
of a new school; his name was a
talisman. But the shadow of genius&mdash;relentless
poverty&mdash;fell upon him
again, and his last days were little
better than a pauper’s.</p>

<p>The literary world of Paris presents
the acme of this combination&mdash;squalor
and talent. Dramatists, poets,
painters, musicians, the smaller fry
of the daily press, the heavier authors
of yellow-covered <i>romans</i>, all mingled
in one inextricable <i>bohemia</i> of
distress, of recklessness, of generosity,
of self-sacrifice. Good and bad
are strangely interwoven; the starving
writer stints himself to help the
dying artist, or the swaggering playwright
repudiates his debts to gamble
away in one night the rare
remuneration of months of toil; and
amid the confusion, the din of
this assemblage, amid this fellowship
of misery, remains the seemingly
eternal truth that the path of scholarship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[854]</a></span>
or even its counterfeit, is <i>not</i>
the legitimate path of success.</p>

<p>In France, where the intellect is so
fertile that it is almost the only land
where literature is a profession, not
a pastime, we may turn to one figure
more, a sweet and angelic one, very
different from the stormy and erratic
geniuses among whom we have been
wandering&mdash;Eugénie de Guérin, the
Catholic poetess, the devoted type
of sisterly love. She was poor, though
not to destitution. The family, once
famous among the Languedoc Crusaders,
and owning a great feudal
estate, had dwindled down to the
possession of a patrimony hardly so
large and not half so rich as a modern
farm. The woman now known
throughout Europe and America by
her exquisite <i>Journal</i> and <i>Letters</i>&mdash;the
starting-point of a new class of domestic
literature&mdash;tells us simply and
playfully enough in those writings&mdash;which
during life she never dreamed
of giving to the public&mdash;of her humble
avocations in her father’s household.
Now we see her, having
cooked the supper with her sister’s
aid while the servants were all gone
to an instruction for confirmation,
sitting by the huge fire in the kitchen,
because it was warm there, and
making a hearty meal of coarse soup,
boiled potatoes, and a cake baked
by herself, “with the dogs and cats to
wait upon us,” as she says. She did
not like these household cares, however;
they were a cross to her, and
her good sister “Mimi” took much
of this cross off her hands. Another
day she has been washing, but she
consoles herself with the thought
of Homer’s Nausicaa washing her
brother’s tunics. Once, when she
was lifting a heavy cauldron from the
kitchen fire, her father tenderly said
he did not like to see her doing such
work; but she answered with a smile
that S. Bonaventure was found washing
the dishes after the refectory
meal when the Papal deputation
came to offer him the cardinal’s
hat! So she taught herself to do
“disgusting things without feeling
disgust; as, for instance, blackening
her hands in the kitchen.” Another
time she makes a hasty note of her
affection for her brother and her unconquerable
longing after solitude,
but adds that she has no time for it
now, “as there are ducks to be
plucked, a pie to be prepared, a little
carnival-dinner got up; in a word,
because the parish priest was coming,
and her help was anxiously
waited for in the kitchen”; while another
day she is mending old house-linen.
On the other hand, she was
reading S. Augustine, S. Jerome, S.
Teresa, Bossuet, Fénélon, Plutarch,
books of theology and philosophy,
mysticism and morals, the works of
great thinkers; she was writing
poems of more exquisite purity and
wealth of imagery than the famous
young brother whom Sainte-Beuve
and George Sand declared one of
the foremost poets of the day: she
was a child in her simplicity, a saint
in her abnegation&mdash;a woman in a
thousand. We have dwelt with the
greater emphasis and satisfaction on
this last reference for the reason that
the modern world, in its haste to
find countenance for its license in
thought and morals, has brought into
prominence only the less worthy
specimens of French genius, to the
neglect of the many admirable writers
who are now for the first time, becoming
familiar to English readers.</p>

<p>This strangely mingled thread of
life which we have illustrated in these
pages has its pathetic as well as its
ludicrous aspect. Men are constantly
complaining of the “injustice”
of God in making inequalities
among them; if they looked a little
deeper, they would see that what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[855]</a></span>
they call inequalities are compensations.
The world has to be ballasted
like a ship; the heaviest merchandise
is not always the most precious,
but it is none the less necessary.
It would be preposterous to expect
<i>all</i> men to be rich, good, and clever;
gifts balance each other in God’s
plan, and, since men sigh so for
riches, the wise Distributor of earthly
prizes has answered many men
literally, and given them riches alone,
leaving their brains a blank. To
discuss this vexed question is not,
however, our intention; a few examples,
such as we have drawn from
real life, speak for themselves, and
facts are ever more tolerated than
disquisitions. We may learn from
those facts a new interest in books;
we may remember, when we read a
new work, that a human being’s life
is sewed in with those pages; that
what we carelessly toss aside after a
moment’s perusal has cost hours of
trouble, of research, probably of
privation; that the pathos that draws
tears from our eyes is often transcribed
and softened down from the
actual experience of the writer; while
the humor we approve of and the piquancy
we admire are rather born of
bitter defiance against an adverse
fate than grown from the natural
soil of a healthy sense of fun. A
book is often the hot-pressed fruit of
an unhappy life rather than the product
of elegant leisure, and one cannot
help feeling a tender but far
from disparaging pity for the thousands
of educated men and women
whose very talent, in a sense, compels
them, through circumstances of privation,
to write in haste and anxiety
books that are inadequate representatives
of that talent.</p>

<p class="p1">These two volumes continue the series
of patristic translations edited so carefully
and published in such splendid
style by the firm of Clark, at Edinburgh.
The publication and perusal of long and
entire works of the fathers, especially S.
Augustine, must have a most happy effect
in promoting the cause of the Catholic
faith. We notice with especial pleasure
the volume on the Trinity. This is
one of the greatest works of S. Augustine.
His argument is wonderfully exhaustive
and conclusive, wonderfully sublime and
devout, wonderfully rich in the exposition
of Holy Scripture. It is also very plain
and intelligible to a patient and attentive
reader when the peculiar difficulties of
the Latin style have been overcome. In
this translation, the structure and meaning
of the sentences and phrases are made
very plain, and one reads with a pleasure
and facility much enhanced by the clearness
and beauty of the page. We recommend
this translation to all who wish for
a very valuable help to the rendering of
S. Augustine in the original, as well as to
those who desire to become acquainted
with his doctrine, and can only do so
through the medium of their own language.</p>

<p class="p1">All who love the mediæval saints, and

<p>The “Journey of S. Willibald to the
Holy Land,” which forms the second
half of the little volume, was written at
Heidenheim about the year 760. “It is
interesting,” says F. Meyrick, “as confirming,

Discussed.</a></span> By E. E. Estcourt,
M.A., F.S.A., Canon of S. Chad’s Cathedral,
Birmingham. With an Appendix
of Original Documents and
Fac-similes. London: Burns &amp; Oates.
1873. (New York: Sold by The Catholic
Publication Society.)</p>

<p class="p1">A controversial work written in a calm
and mild tone is sure to claim attention
and wise confidence, especially if that
work deals with a difficult question, and
one involved in much obscurity and uncertainty.
Such is the style of the work
before us, and such is the character of the
question the Rev. Canon Estcourt treats&mdash;Anglican
Ordinations.</p>

<p>This is truly a masterly work, and the
author exhibits throughout that modesty
which is the mark of a true scholar. But
he does not condescend to his antagonist;
he is fully aware that he is at warfare,
but at warfare <i>pro causa veritatis</i>. He is
a brave warrior, and wields a heavy weapon;
he studies his foe well before he
strikes, but, when he strikes, he strikes in
a vital part.</p>

<p>We do not mean to say that he has
finished the much-discussed question of
Anglican ordinations, or that Anglicans
will hereafter have nothing to say. They
will always have something to say so
long as the Establishment lasts. But we
believe there are a large number of Anglicans
who are serious and in earnest,
and who conscientiously believe they
have a priesthood, and it is among them
we hope to see this book produce some
practical result.</p>

<p>The present work starts out in the introduction
with a “statement of the question”
it is about to treat of, in which the
author says he does not claim to bring
forth much in the way of new facts or new
principles, but aims rather at a more
careful application of principles already
laid down, and to show the real influence
of the facts alleged by Anglicans (as, for
instance, the consecration of Parker),
even if true. It then states the Catholic
doctrine on the question of holy orders,
and finally lays down the principles of
evidence to be followed in the investigation
of historical facts.</p>

<p>The author commences with the “Origin
of the Controversy,” in which, after
showing how the seeds of heresy were
first planted by Wyckliffe, and spread by
the Lollards, and that the heresies on the
Continent and in England were all one
and the same growth&mdash;which Anglicans
have so strenuously tried to deny&mdash;he
exhibits the manner in which the Anglican
rite was compiled, and shows that the
form of ordination in the Edwardine ordinal
was not primitive, but a compilation
from the ritual of the Roman Church
of the middle ages, there being nothing
in it earlier than the IXth century,
and most from the XIIIth and XIVth.</p>

<p>He then treats of the validity of the
orders given in the new form, as tested
by Queen Mary’s reign and the acts of
Cardinal Pole, and shows by a number
of cases, and a careful analysis of the
different classes the Cardinal Legate had
to deal with, that both “the Papal brief
and the cardinal’s acts furnish the clearest
possible evidence that the Holy See
regarded the Edwardine ordinations as
utterly worthless” (p. 40), and therefore
that the Anglican claim of Catholics admitting
these ordinations as valid is a
false one.</p>

<p>The second, third, and fourth chapters
are devoted to the “History of the Controversy.”</p>

<p>First, the mere matter of fact, with regard
to those much-contested consecrations,
is discussed. As to Barlow, the
author, while giving the Anglicans the
full benefit of all their documents and
proofs of this poor man so involved in
mist, shows that his consecration at least
cannot be proved.</p>

<p>The author very justly concludes respecting
Barlow that while we cannot
come to any positive decision, yet, “with
so many circumstances of suspicion arising
from different quarters, yet pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857">[857]</a></span>
the same way, it is impossible to admit
the fact of his consecration without more
direct proof of it” (p. 81).</p>

<p>Parker’s case is next taken up. Of
course, the author discards the Nag’s
Head story; and with regard to the
mere fact of Parker’s consecration having
taken place, he acknowledges it
must be admitted. But he shows that
such a consecration, from the grave
doubts whether Barlow was ever consecrated,
and the manner in which ordinations
of the Book of Common Prayer of
1552 were treated, was utterly worthless.</p>

<p>After giving the testimony of contemporary
Catholics in the matter of Parker’s
consecration, he says: “But taking them
all together, it must be granted that they
admit the fact of the consecration having
taken place as alleged, but it is also evident
that they imply some serious difficulty
respecting it, and apparently touching
the persons acting therein; and, further,
that this difficulty extended so far as
not merely to render the consecration
uncanonical, unlawful, and irregular, but
also to affect its validity” (p. 126).</p>

<p>Then having shown the practice of the
church with those who returned to the
true faith, he gives a list of the Anglican
ministers who became reconciled to the
Catholic Church down to the year 1704,
and thus answers by facts the claim set up
by Dr. Lee, founded on the alleged refusal
of twelve converts to be reordained
because they claimed to be true priests.</p>

<p>Next follows a short review of the controversy
as carried on so far by both Anglicans
and Catholics, after which commences
what we consider as really the
most important part of the book; for the
rest of the work deals entirely with the
<i>validity</i> of Anglican ordinations.</p>

<p>This second half of the work we look
upon as instituting a new era in the controversy.
Heretofore, writers have occupied
themselves principally with trying
to disprove the facts with regard to the
Anglican consecrations, and have done
very little to prove the invalidity of such
consecrations, even if they took place.
Canon Estcourt has entered into this very
thoroughly, and made it clear.</p>

<p>He commences by an examination of
the most ancient forms of ordination, and
coming down through the various rites,
and giving the teaching of the fathers,
shows what the matter and form of ordination
most probably consists in. Having
established this, he gives the practice
of the church in her official decisions in
two important cases.</p>

<p>The author has devoted a chapter to
the refutation of the story of Pius IV. and
Queen Elizabeth, which is the Anglican
Nag’s Head, and which we suppose is at
least well to have repeated, as there may
be some on whom this worn-out fable
would still have an influence.</p>

<p>In the concluding chapters, the argument
is summed up, and “the inevitable
conclusion follows that Anglican ordinations
must be considered as altogether
invalid, and that there is neither bishop,
priest, nor deacon in the Anglican communion.
And the reasons for this conclusion
may be stated in a summary way
as follows:</p>

<p>“1. Because from the year 1554 it has
been the unvarying practice of the Catholic
Church so to consider and treat them.</p>

<p>“2. Because there are grave doubts
whether Barlow, the consecrator of Parker,
had ever himself received episcopal
consecration; and, in fact, the probabilities
of the case incline more strongly
against than in favor of it.</p>

<p>“3. Because the Anglican forms of
ordination have been altered from the
ancient forms, both by way of mutilation
and addition, in such a manner as to exclude,
on the part of those participating
in the acts enjoined, any intention of conferring
or receiving a sacrament, or sacramental
grace, or a spiritual character,
or any sacerdotal or episcopal power.</p>

<p>“4. Because the same forms have been
also altered purposely, with the view of
excluding the idea of the priest at his
ordination receiving power to offer sacrifice.</p>

<p>“5. Because Anglican bishops and
priests, at the time of ordination, join in a
profession contrary to the Catholic faith
in the holy sacrifice, thus assuming on
themselves, by their own act, the spirit
and erroneous intentions with which the
alterations were made.</p>

<p>“6. Because the meaning here attributed
to the Anglican forms receives
confirmation from the fact of its being
doubtful whether the word ‘priest’ in the
Anglican forms of ordination means a
priest in the sense of the Catholic
Church; that is to say, <i>sacerdos</i>, ‘a sacrificing
priest.’</p>

<p>“7. Because the meaning of the same
forms is further illustrated from the ‘Order
of Administration of Holy Communion’
in the Book of Common Prayer,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">[858]</a></span></p>

<p>which is found to be contrary to the
Catholic faith in the doctrines of the
holy sacrifice of the Eucharist and the
Real Presence” (pp. 373-4).</p>

<p>Let us leave the author’s last words for
those who are serious and in earnest, to
meditate upon:</p>

<p>“What, then, Anglicans have to consider,
the questions they have to ask
themselves, are these: What do they
really believe about the grace of holy
orders, and even about the grace of
the sacraments in general? and next,
What are the conditions on which that
grace is ordinarily given? And then to
look whether those conditions are fulfilled
within the Anglican communion.
If they would seriously, as in the sight of
God, consider these points, we might
hope to attain to truth, which is before
all things, and after truth to see peace
following in her train, and union, not
based on vague terms and unharmonious
professions, but in ‘one body and one
spirit, as called in one hope of our vocation,
one Lord, one faith one baptism’”
(p. 379).</p>

Chas. Garside. London: Burns &amp;
Oates. 1873. (New York: Sold by
The Catholic Publication Society.)</p>

<p class="p1">This is a peculiar work, hardly classifiable
under any conventional head in religious
literature. It has the charm of
refined and elegant diction, joined to the
weightier recommendation of practical
usefulness. It is a history of the prophet
Elias, following the startling yet meagre
facts of his life as revealed in the Old
Testament, and drawing from them analogies
wonderfully suited to our own
times, lives, temptations, and hopes. It
is not one of the least perfections of that
incomparable Book, the Holy Scriptures,
that it should apply with such marvellous
truth to any time, person, or circumstance;
that it should offer as living a
counsel, as efficacious a comfort, as dread
a warning to every individual man in his
own obscure orbit of to-day as it did thousands
of years ago to exalted personages
in unwonted trials. It is not only the
political history of one people; it is the
history of the human soul at all times
and in all places. Thus, the author has
drawn from the mysterious records of
Elias&mdash;who at first would seem but a colossal
saint, utterly removed from any
appreciation that would seek to go beyond
admiration&mdash;parallels between human
duties and human weaknesses under
the reign of Achab, and the same duties
and weaknesses under the rulers of our
day. There is something in this book of
the alluring style of F. Faber’s religious
works, but without that floweriness of
speech of which no one was a safe master
but that prose-poet himself.</p>

Translated from the French by
Helena Lyons. Boston: P. Donahoe.
1873.</p>

<p class="p1">This collection of discourses, addressed
to women on the duties of their
daily life by the former Bishop of La Rochelle,
now Archbishop of Rheims, is a
most valuable work, and contains an
epitome of everything woman should do,
know, and teach. There can hardly be
too much of the same tenor written on
this subject, and all that is written should
be sown broadcast over Christendom by
the best translations. That before our
notice seems a very terse one, faithful
but not slavish. Indeed, a translator
often has it in his power to mar the whole
effect of a most important work by dressing
it in such unmistakably foreign garb
that it becomes unacceptable to the peculiar
mind of this or that nationality. Mgr.
Landriot’s discourses, though addressed
to French women and to <i>provinciales</i>, are
couched in such broad terms, and inspired</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[859]</a></span></p>

<p>by so comprehensive a spirit, that they
are equally applicable to women of all
nations, whether in populous cities or retired
country towns. The conditions of
all classes are also so delicately brought
within the circle of his consideration that
even poor and obscure women may find
in them as effectual guidance as the wife
of a cabinet minister or of a financial
magnate. True Christianity alone can
inspire true cosmopolitanism, and that
without violating patriotism. The spirit
of petty localism, or, in fact, of any narrow-mindedness
on any subject, is foreign
to the wise prelate’s mind, and nowhere
defaces his writings; yet, at the
same time, he knows how to make skilful
use of his surroundings, and take illustrations
from objects constantly before
the eyes of his immediate hearers. In the
fourth discourse he expounds the text of
Proverbs, “She is like the merchant’s
ship, she bringeth her bread from afar”
(xxxi. 14); and speaking as the bishop of
a seaport town to a community whose
interests were probably in many cases
connected with the sea, he draws the
most original comparisons between an
ideal woman and a perfect ship. Masts,
helm, rigging, cargo, ballast, compass,
chart, crew, etc., nothing is forgotten, and
every detail tallies with some spiritual
attribute of the life of a holy and “valiant”
woman. In another place he compares
woman to a bridge, the support and link
of many souls, and makes the bold simile
very plausible by his well-chosen remarks
on the united flexibility and strength required
in woman’s character. There is
not a point of domestic life which he does
not touch upon fearlessly, not a duty he
does not point out minutely. Sins of
sloth, of vanity, of imprudent speech, of
undue susceptibility, are all unmasked;
the relations between woman and those
who come in contact with her as wife,
mother, mistress, or friend are all accurately
sketched; her pursuits are regulated,
but with no intolerant hand; her
sphere mapped out, but with no niggardly
restrictions. Country life and occupation
are commended as healthful for the body,
and leading to peace of mind and soul;
good sayings, tersely expressed, are scattered
here and there; as, for instance:
“Virtue and vice are distinguished by the
quantity of the dose; put the right quantity,
and you have a virtue; take away
that quantity, or exceed it, and you have
a vice.” There is in the whole work a
tone of moderation singularly adapted to
the needs of the day, a shrinking from exaggeration
in any form, and a hesitancy
in condemning anything the excess of
which only can be styled a sin. The lecturer
leans for these moderate views on
the writings of S. Francis of Sales, that
rare director of virtuous women in the
world. One very beautiful idea, with
which we do not remember ever to have
met before in any shape, is that of the
“divine magnetism” exercised by Providence,
and which turns the bitterest
draught of human woe into a delicious
nectar for those who trust in God, while
“the cup of earthly happiness” held to
the lips of the “spoiled child of fortune
... has infused therein a poison to
disturb and agitate the inmost depths of
his being.”</p>

<p>The picture of the valiant woman of
the Proverbs is thus brought before the
eyes of women of the XIXth century, not
as something magnificently inimitable,
as personated by a Judith, a Jael, or an
Esther, but as a perfectly attainable state,
as exemplified by S. Monica, S. Paula, S.
Elizabeth of Hungary. Neither the heroic,
the learned, nor the commercial side of life
is shut out from them, although the domestic
is specially inculcated; and in
Mgr. Landriot woman will find a meeter
and more dignified champion than in the
prophetesses of “woman’s rights.” Our
only regret is that such “valiant” and
perfect women should be so rare among
us. A few such Christian matrons would
revolutionize their sex.</p>

<p class="p1">This a short historical tale of the latter
end of the XVIIth century, and is put
together from various records of known
details of the Titus Oates plot. It was
quite another phase of religious persecution
from that prevalent a hundred
years before under Queen Elizabeth,
and Titus Oates, in his hypocrisy
and meanness, forms a contrast to the
more open though not less cruel inquisitors
of Tudor days. The incidents
of the story are, as facts, quite imaginary,
though fashioned in accordance with
probability and the known incidents of
similar <i>real</i> vicissitudes; the style is very
clear and agreeable, and the personages
attractive in character, especially the old

The details of the martyrdom of the
saintly Archbishop of Armagh, Oliver

the lesser but hardly less touching sorrows
of the young Rupert, the hero of the
tale. The end is bright and hopeful, unlike
many of those solemn tragedies in
days of old, but just such as is fitted to
encourage the minds of our day. There
is in the beginning of the book a very
pleasant description of an old English
village of Yorkshire, and a hint to travellers
who, in frantic pursuit of distant
pleasure, are whirled past such sylvan
retreats on their way to fashionable places
of “repose.”</p>

<p class="p1">The half-historic, half-conversational
style in which these sketches are written
makes good display of the author’s undoubted
powers; and this, too, in spite
of some carelessness. With the exception
of the unfortunate mention made of
the share which Irish gentlemen took in
the practice of duelling, the book is excellent
reading. The subject is one invested
with a sad charm for all who, by
blood, or religion, or love of valor, can
sympathize with a cruelly oppressed yet
warlike and adventurous people. The
author gives us only a small fragment of
the history of Irish military exploits&mdash;“some
flowers,” as the preface says,
“culled from the immortal garlands with
which modern history has enwreathed
the brow of Irish valor.” Yet it suffices
to produce a vivid impression of how
Irishmen have done honor to their own
race, and given generous and valuable
service to the military enterprises of
nearly every civilized nation. We hope
that as good a pen and as appreciative a
mind will some day give a complete history
of the Irishmen who figured conspicuously
in our late war. The author, indeed,
dedicates his book to the memory
of his countrymen “who fought and fell”
in that great struggle, and refers specially
to some few of them, while turning over
to the future historian the task of doing
them all full justice.</p>

Virgin.</a></span> By Most Hon. Brother Philippe,
Superior General of the Brothers
of the Christian Schools. Translated
from the French. Baltimore: Kelly,
Piet &amp; Co. 1874.</p>

<p class="p1">This substantial volume bears the
<i>imprimatur</i> of His Grace the Archbishop
of Baltimore. And the other approbation,
by the Vicar-General of the Right
Rev. Bishop of Versailles, says that the
writer is officially assured that the work
“will prove a new and most precious
fountain from which pious souls may be
abundantly supplied with the healing
waters of devotion to the Mother of God.”
From what we have had time to see of
the book, we also are convinced that it is
a most solid and valuable addition to the
best manuals of a devotion which can
never be exhausted, but, on the contrary,
is destined to increase till He who first
came into the world by Mary shall in
some sense come again by her.</p>

<p>We therefore welcome this volume
very gratefully, and recommend it to our
Catholic readers.</p>

We had intended to give a brief outline of
what the church has done from time to time for
the various forms of human want, but found we
could not do so in the present article without departing
from the diversified character essential
to a magazine. Such a sketch of the efforts
made by the church, during her long history,
to alleviate physical suffering, and for the moral
elevation of the race, would almost be a history
of the church itself, inasmuch as the poor have
always been her heritage, in accordance with
our Lord’s words. To the Catholic reader this
would have been unnecessary; and if this reference
serves the purpose of inducing the candid
non-Catholic to look into the record, a desirable
end will have been accomplished.</p>

<p class="pfn8">“<i>Indico legno, lucido e sereno</i>:”</p>

<p class="pfc4">Whatever kind of richly tinted wood is referred to in this passage, <i>lucid</i> and <i>serene</i> do not seem
very descriptive epithets, applied to wood, and it is not much after the manner of Dante to qualify
any object with two vague adjectives. As he is presenting an assemblage of the most beautiful and
striking colors, and since we do not imagine (as Mr. Ruskin suggests) that by “Indico legno” he
could have meant <i>indigo</i>, it seems most natural that he should have mentioned <i>blue</i>. We have
therefore ventured to translate as if the verse were written, “Indico legno, lucido sereno.” In a
preceding Canto (V.) the poet has used <i>sereno</i> in the same way, without the article&mdash;“<i>fender sereno</i>”
also in Canto XXIX., v. 53:</p>

<p class="pfn8">“Più chiaro assai che Luna per sereno.”</p>

This was a German Reformer who died in 1551.
His name was Kuhhorn (Cowshorn), but, after
the fashion of that day, he Greekified it into <i>Bous</i>
(ox) and <i>Keras</i> (horn): the same as Melanchthon,
another German Reformer, changed his name

M. de Pressensé means the <i>deutero-canonical</i>
books of the Old Testament. <i>Deutero-canonical</i>
and <i>apocryphal</i> are by no means synonymous.
The authenticity of the deutero-canonical books
has been demonstrated sufficiently often within
three centuries to prevent a writer, with any respect
for himself, from alluding to them as apocryphal.</p>

We wish M. de Pressensé would be kind
enough to inform us what Fathers of the IId and
IIId centuries have questioned the origin of the
Gospel according to S. Matthew. We are well
aware that French rationalists have borrowed
the German idea of a primitive Gospel, which,
perhaps, served as a basis for the other abridgments.
The promoters of this system are Eichorn,
Eckermann, Gieseler, Credner, and Ewald, in
Germany; in France, Messrs. Réville and Renan
have lent to it the support of their names.
They have endeavored to support it by one or
two words of Papias, which by no means prove so
strange an assertion. Where are the Fathers of
the IId and IIId centuries who had any doubt as
to the authenticity of the first Gospel? As to the
Epistle to the Hebrews, we wish M. de Pressensé
would read a few pages on this question
by the Rev. Père Franzelin, in his able treatise,
<i>De Traditione et Scriptura</i>. He would see how
little doubt the Fathers of the first ages had respecting
this epistle. Some, on account of the
absence of S. Paul’s name, and the difference of
style, have doubted it was by the doctor of nations,
but all the Fathers, unless we except two
or three of the least known, invariably asserted
its canonicity. For it is one thing to doubt
whether S. Paul was the author of this epistle
and another that it is of the number of inspired
books.</p>

In Thackeray’s <i>Catherine</i>, already quoted,
a character appears with “a little shabby beaver
cocked over a large <i>tow-periwig</i>.” Still further
on he tells us that one of his principal personages
“mounted a large chestnut-colored orange-scented
pyramid of horse-hair.” Indeed, we
have reason to believe that the judges and the
bar in England still wear wigs manufactured out
of the latter article.</p>

To show, by a further instance, the employment
of another article than hair for the manufacture
in question some time ago. Thackeray,

of a London “coachman in a tight <i>silk-floss</i>
wig.”</p>

“Egli secondò il secolo in tutte le sue tendenze:

Here are his own words: “E mi rammento
come predicando nel Duomo l’anno 1491, ed avendo
già composto il mio sermone sopra questi visioni,
deliberai di sopprimerle e nell’avvenire astenerme
affatto. Iddio mi è testimonio, che tutto
il giorno di sabato e l’intera notte sino alla nuove
luce, io vegliai; ed ogni altra via, ogni dottrina
fuori di quella, mi fu tolta. In sull’alba, essendo
per la lunga vigilia stanco ed abbattuto, udii,
mentre io pregava, una voce che mi disse:
Stolto, non vedi che Iddio vuole che tu sequiti
la medesima via? Perchè io feci quel giorno
una predica tremenda.”</p>

The original is, “Avendo perduto ogni fiducia

all confidence in the priests.”</p>

We have followed Villari in the account of
this interview. M. Perrens questions its authenticity
for several very good reasons. If it was a
confession, no one would know anything about
it. But it is claimed by some that it was merely
a consultation on a case of conscience, and that
Politian was an <i>ocular</i> though not an <i>auricular</i>
witness. If such an interview took place, we
should be inclined to admit Villari’s account of
it only on the latter hypothesis.</p>

No. 360 of the journal <i>Il Precursore</i>, of Palermo,
dared lately to apply to the Sovereign
Pontiff Pius IX. the names sacristan-pontiff,
blockhead, dullard, swindler, huckster, dotard,
and other epithets so coarse that the pen refuses
to transcribe them. But the Italian Exchequer,
notwithstanding the law which declares the
Pope to be as inviolable as the king, found nothing
to say against this foul sheet. And the
government pretends that the so-called law of
guarantees is scrupulously observed by it. We
appeal to the common sense, not of Christians,
but of persons simply not barbarians like the
Hottentots.</p>

education as exaggerated. We concur in this
judgment, which is, moreover, in accordance
with the instructions on this subject emanating
from the Holy See. At the same time, we are
strongly convinced that there is a very considerable
amount of truth in the criticisms of the
Abbé Gaume on the actual method of education
even in strictly Catholic colleges, and that it
needs to be made more Christian.&mdash;Ed. C. W.</p>

Cicero says: “Fuit jam a Platone accepta

altera de natura et rebus occultis; tertia
de disserendo, et quid verum, quid falsum, quid
rectum in oratione, pravumque, quid consentiens,
quid repugnans, judicando” (<i>Acad.</i> lib.
i. 6). This division is still recognizable in our
modern logic, metaphysics, and ethics.</p>

These reptiles were still so numerous in this
part of the country not many years ago that it
was extremely dangerous to leave the windows
open in the evening. My mother related that,
while she was living at Sandwich with her father,
one of the domestics was imprudent enough to
leave a window open. During the evening, they
had occasion to move a sideboard which stood
against the wall, and a large snake was discovered
behind it fast asleep. Another day, when
playing truant, a snake sprang upon her, and
tried to bite her waist; but happily her clothes
were so thick that its fangs could not penetrate
them. While she ran in great terror, her companions
called to her to untie her skirt. And that
advice saved her life.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Author.</span></p>

“This image of the Druids is of a Moorish
color, as are nearly all the others in the church
of Chartres. We suppose this to have been
done by the Druids and others who followed
them, on the presumptive complexion of the
oriental people, who are exposed more than we
to the heat of the sun; for which reason the
Spouse in the Canticle of Canticles says that the
sun has discolored her, and that, although she is
dark, she does not cease to be beautiful. Nevertheless,
Nicephorus, who had seen several pictures
of the Virgin taken by S. Luke from life,
says that the color of her countenance was
<i>σιτοχρόε</i>, or the color of wheat. This seems to
mean the brown or chestnut color of wheat
when ripe.”</p>

“The Virgin was of middle height....
Her hair bordered on gold, her eyes were
bright and sparkling, with the pupils of an
olive color; her eyebrows arched, and of a
black tinge, very pleasing. Her nose was long,
her lips bright red, her face neither round nor
sharp, but somewhat long; her hands and fingers
equally so. She was in all things modest
and grave, speaking but seldom and to the
purpose; ready to listen to every one, affable
to all, honoring each according to their quality.
She used a becoming freedom of speech, without
laughter and without perturbation, without

The mention of the name of Montalembert
by the writer of the present article gives us the
occasion to make an explanation which we think
it proper to make, on account of some criticisms
that have been called forth by the manner in
which we have spoken of him in former articles.
The eulogium which we give or permit others
to give this illustrious man in our pages by no
means implies any approbation of any opinions
or acts of his in sympathy with the party known
by the sobriquet of “Liberal Catholics.” These
were deflections from a course which was in the
main orthodox and loyal, and it is not for these
deflections that we honor his memory, but for
his virtues, merits, and services, and the cordial
submission to the authority of the Holy See at
the close of life, by which he effaced the memory
of his faults.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed. C. W.</span></p>

These facts are chiefly gathered from an
article on Hawthorne by Mr. Stoddard; but
this anecdote is from a weekly publication, to
which we are also indebted for the incident in the
life of Edgar A. Poe.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
